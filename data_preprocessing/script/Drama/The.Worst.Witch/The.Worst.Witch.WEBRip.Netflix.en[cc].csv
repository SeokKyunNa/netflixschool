00:00:53.520,00:00:56.520,"Yes, I'm here. The transference spell worked perfectly."
00:00:58.280,00:01:00.760,"Don't worry, I'm fine. Love you, too!"
00:01:00.840,00:01:01.920,What?
00:01:04.160,00:01:06.160,My phone! Why'd you do that?
00:01:06.240,00:01:09.320,Such devices are not permitted here.
00:01:09.400,00:01:11.800,But I promised Mum I'd call her all the time.
00:01:11.880,00:01:14.200,You are here on a trial basis.
00:01:14.280,00:01:18.840,"Frankly, I will be amazed if you last until the end of the week."
00:01:26.960,00:01:27.800,Maud!
00:01:29.560,00:01:30.400,Agh!
00:01:32.000,00:01:34.200,Sorry! Sorry!
00:01:34.280,00:01:37.040,Sorry for charging into me like a clumsy hippo?
00:01:37.600,00:01:40.800,Or sorry for sabotaging my entrance exam?
00:01:41.440,00:01:44.960,"It was an accident, both times."
00:01:49.760,00:01:51.920,-Maud. -Mildred!
00:01:53.520,00:01:55.120,Did your mum knit that scarf?
00:01:56.560,00:01:59.120,Yes. Why?
00:02:05.000,00:02:07.640,House sashes.
00:02:07.720,00:02:11.080,"Uh, the color shows you which corridor your rooms are."
00:02:12.440,00:02:14.680,"Oh, we're not together."
00:02:15.240,00:02:17.760,"Sorry, HB decides who goes where."
00:02:17.840,00:02:21.920,-But see your sash? -Yeah. What does it mean?
00:02:22.800,00:02:27.880,It means you came top in the entrance exam and so you're head of Year One.
00:02:28.840,00:02:29.840,Top?
00:02:30.840,00:02:35.440,"To be slightly more accurate, you were the least worst..."
00:02:36.120,00:02:38.000,"-but yes. -Well done, Maud!"
00:02:40.200,00:02:41.760,Enough.
00:02:41.840,00:02:44.880,It's time you were assigned your familiars.
00:02:45.200,00:02:47.200,-Familiars? -Our cats!
00:02:59.800,00:03:01.840,Maud Spellbody.
00:03:11.080,00:03:16.000,"As head of year, you may have first choice."
00:03:25.320,00:03:26.600,"Choose wisely, dear."
00:03:42.800,00:03:44.080,I choose this one.
00:03:48.680,00:03:50.760,I name him Midnight.
00:03:56.720,00:03:58.480,"Oh, he's so cute!"
00:04:01.080,00:04:03.240,"Oh, his tail's just so soft."
00:04:07.440,00:04:11.520,And last but not least... Mildred Hubble.
00:04:11.600,00:04:13.480,Um... Um... Miss Cackle.
00:04:13.560,00:04:16.000,"-Hurry up, Mildred. -But there are no cats left!"
00:04:16.760,00:04:19.200,"It's OK, Hecate, I've got him."
00:04:19.279,00:04:21.360,Caught this little fella making a run for it.
00:04:21.440,00:04:22.560,Here you go!
00:04:23.160,00:04:25.120,But... but he's...
00:04:25.200,00:04:26.600,He's not...
00:04:26.680,00:04:28.360,He's... he's tabby.
00:04:28.440,00:04:32.040,"Tabby! Not a traditional name, but it'll do."
00:04:35.680,00:04:39.320,"Miss Cackle, please, can't I have a black one like the others?"
00:04:39.400,00:04:43.200,"Mildred, you have named Tabby, and now he is yours."
00:04:44.040,00:04:46.920,"I'm sorry, Tabby. It's not your fault."
00:04:47.000,00:04:53.120,"I know he isn't what you expected, but it's a foolish witch who judges by appearances. Hmm?"
00:04:55.000,00:04:59.680,There you are... working already.
00:04:59.760,00:05:02.120,-I don't want to get behind. -It's your first day.
00:05:02.200,00:05:05.280,Why don't you just chill a bit?
00:05:08.280,00:05:09.720,"Sorry, what?"
00:05:09.800,00:05:16.440,"I should have smashed that entrance exam, broken your record into a million pieces, if it wasn't for Mildred Hubble."
00:05:16.520,00:05:20.080,"Ethie, it was an accident, nobody's fault."
00:05:20.160,00:05:23.680,Why are you defending Mildred? Did you put her up to it?
00:05:23.760,00:05:26.880,Me? Why would I-- 'Cause you couldn't stand to let me beat you.
00:05:27.520,00:05:29.080,"For once, I'd be the favorite."
00:05:29.160,00:05:31.240,I'd have been given Granny Hallow's broomstick.
00:05:31.320,00:05:32.840,It's just because I'm older.
00:05:32.920,00:05:35.720,It's been passed down to the eldest daughter for...
00:05:36.240,00:05:37.720,13 generations.
00:05:37.800,00:05:40.160,Exactly. It's always been all about you.
00:05:41.800,00:05:46.600,"I'm sorry you feel like that, but it's not fair to take it out on Mildred."
00:05:46.680,00:05:48.760,"Well, life isn't fair."
00:05:48.840,00:05:52.920,"If it was, I'd be the eldest. I'd have everything you've got."
00:05:53.560,00:05:56.320,"Now please, let me get on with my work."
00:06:16.200,00:06:20.080,I can't do this in front of her. I'll mess up and fail my trial.
00:06:20.160,00:06:21.720,"You've already flown, remember?"
00:06:21.800,00:06:24.360,Some girls haven't even been on a broomstick yet.
00:06:25.160,00:06:27.320,Sorry I'm late! Sorry!
00:06:28.440,00:06:31.040,"Sorry, Miss Hardbroom. Sorry."
00:06:32.880,00:06:35.680,"Right! Brooms on the ground, group one."
00:06:38.560,00:06:43.840,"Now, say it with me, nice and loud: Hover."
00:06:44.400,00:06:45.480,Hover!
00:06:53.360,00:06:54.520,did it.
00:06:56.800,00:07:00.040,Hover! Hover! What's wrong with it?
00:07:00.400,00:07:03.800,"Nothing! You just need to be firmer, show that broom who's boss!"
00:07:04.360,00:07:06.680,"Come on, girl, give it all you've got!"
00:07:08.240,00:07:09.600,Hover!
00:07:20.280,00:07:22.440,"Right, time to get flying."
00:07:22.960,00:07:26.720,"Excellent, Ethel. Beautiful posture, both you and the cat."
00:07:26.800,00:07:29.960,"Girls, I want you all to copy Ethel."
00:07:30.480,00:07:32.280,"May I fly now, Miss Drill?"
00:07:32.360,00:07:34.120,"Yes, yes, off you pop."
00:07:41.000,00:07:42.800,"Pointy work, Ethel."
00:07:44.320,00:07:47.040,"Now, girls, you all saw what Ethel did."
00:07:47.120,00:07:51.200,Give the broom a good sharp tap and away you go. Go!
00:07:53.760,00:07:55.240,"Go, go, go!"
00:07:59.320,00:08:01.120,-Mildred Hubble! -It's Tabby.
00:08:01.200,00:08:04.560,"-Come on, girl, get up there! -He really, really doesn't want to."
00:08:04.640,00:08:06.520,"Don't give me excuses, give me height!"
00:08:35.600,00:08:39.240,"-Maud! Stop! -Sorry, Ethel, I didn't mean to."
00:09:00.920,00:09:03.960,This is what happens when we get sloppy.
00:09:04.520,00:09:13.720,There will be a special test on basic broomstick skills at the end of the week for girls and cats.
00:09:14.320,00:09:20.040,"Failure will incur consequences, and I think you know what they are."
00:09:20.120,00:09:23.840,"But, please, Miss Hardbroom, I can't, not by the end of the week."
00:09:23.920,00:09:25.040,Tabby gets so scared.
00:09:25.120,00:09:28.640,"Do you know what a witch is, Mildred Hubble?"
00:09:29.480,00:09:32.880,Do you know what a witch does?
00:09:34.880,00:09:36.840,"Uh, spells?"
00:09:40.040,00:09:41.120,Broomstick flying.
00:09:42.800,00:09:45.280,Wears a pointy hat?
00:09:49.240,00:09:51.920,A witch takes responsibility.
00:09:53.000,00:09:57.120,A witch does not whine when things don't go her way.
00:09:57.200,00:10:01.480,A witch makes things go her way.
00:10:04.480,00:10:08.520,Class... dismissed.
00:10:11.840,00:10:13.920,"Don't worry, we'll teach him."
00:10:15.160,00:10:17.240,"That's it, Midnight."
00:10:20.160,00:10:23.680,Um... I can't do this.
00:10:36.800,00:10:39.600,"Face it, Maud, she's a lost cause."
00:10:41.880,00:10:43.960,She's my best friend.
00:10:54.160,00:10:56.400,Remember what I said about Mildred.
00:10:56.720,00:10:59.280,"She's worked so hard, she deserves a chance."
00:10:59.600,00:11:00.480,I know.
00:11:01.400,00:11:02.600,OK.
00:11:02.680,00:11:05.360,"And actually, I was going to help her train her cat."
00:11:05.840,00:11:07.480,You're going to help her?
00:11:07.560,00:11:11.720,You sound surprised. You always did underestimate me.
00:11:15.080,00:11:18.160,We need to eliminate the weak links.
00:11:18.240,00:11:20.560,-You mean Mildred Hubble? -The sooner the better.
00:11:20.640,00:11:23.560,We must consider the best interests of the school.
00:11:23.640,00:11:26.040,And when did I ever fail to do that?
00:11:30.080,00:11:33.640,"I know you think I was too soft on Agatha, but she's my sister."
00:11:33.720,00:11:35.720,Who tried to take over your school.
00:11:35.800,00:11:38.120,It's only my school because I'm the oldest.
00:11:39.440,00:11:47.640,"If things had been different, do you think-- I think we have quite enough to worry about without speculating about what might have been."
00:11:54.520,00:11:58.720,It's not fair that you've got Tabby. You've only just started flying lessons.
00:11:58.800,00:12:05.680,"And I've had loads of practice, so... why don't we swap cats?"
00:12:06.320,00:12:07.800,I couldn't do that.
00:12:08.560,00:12:11.400,But maybe I could borrow Midnight for a bit?
00:12:12.040,00:12:14.400,Just so he can show Tabby how it's done.
00:12:23.720,00:12:27.680,"Ada, you're finally speaking to me then."
00:12:29.000,00:12:30.640,"How are you, Agatha?"
00:12:30.720,00:12:31.920,"Oh, terrible."
00:12:32.760,00:12:37.840,"Every day, mother goes on and on about what a bad daughter I am and how I've let her down."
00:12:38.920,00:12:40.760,It's like being a kid again.
00:12:41.040,00:12:43.400,Our childhood wasn't that bad.
00:12:43.480,00:12:48.880,"Yours wasn't, but then, you're the good one, the nice one."
00:12:49.480,00:12:51.800,And whose fault is that?
00:12:51.880,00:12:56.280,"Oh, it's so easy to be the nice one when everything goes your way..."
00:12:57.040,00:13:01.680,"but if I were the oldest, you'd be stuck here instead of me."
00:13:02.520,00:13:04.760,"You made your bed, Agatha."
00:13:04.840,00:13:10.080,"I know, and I'm sorry. I deserve to be punished."
00:13:11.200,00:13:15.200,You've taken away my powers. But please...
00:13:16.040,00:13:18.160,you can't keep me here forever.
00:13:25.040,00:13:27.680,Just stay on the broom. Look how Midnight does it.
00:13:29.640,00:13:31.440,"Come on, Tabs, you can do it!"
00:13:34.440,00:13:35.840,"Come on, Tabs."
00:13:40.080,00:13:42.120,What an interesting room.
00:13:42.200,00:13:44.280,Did you know they used to use it to store junk?
00:13:44.360,00:13:49.040,"Yeah, I'm sure you've got loads of jokes about that, but I'm a bit busy right now."
00:13:49.720,00:13:50.800,I know.
00:13:55.040,00:13:56.320,Sardines.
00:13:57.120,00:13:58.640,It's an old witches' trick.
00:13:58.720,00:14:03.080,Pour some of this on your broomstick. It'll help him get over his fear.
00:14:03.640,00:14:07.320,"He's a lovely cat, really, such a nice shiny coat."
00:14:07.680,00:14:10.600,"He can't help the stripes, can you, Tabby?"
00:14:13.600,00:14:16.600,Why are you doing this? You don't even like me.
00:14:16.680,00:14:22.560,"I know we got off to a bad start, but I'd hate to see you kicked out on your very first week."
00:14:23.560,00:14:26.560,-So would I. -Good luck tomorrow.
00:14:27.120,00:14:29.400,Um... You too.
00:14:33.240,00:14:36.000,I think she's less scary when she's mean.
00:14:47.560,00:14:48.920,Tabby?
00:14:52.640,00:14:53.560,Tabby!
00:14:55.520,00:14:58.720,"Oh, hi, Midnight. Have you seen Tabby?"
00:15:09.120,00:15:11.680,"There you are, I thought I'd lost you."
00:15:13.600,00:15:16.440,"Look, I know how you feel, but running away won't help."
00:15:16.520,00:15:18.880,We have to pass this test.
00:15:27.800,00:15:30.360,Cat keeping his balance perfectly.
00:15:37.920,00:15:39.560,You can do it.
00:15:42.920,00:15:45.200,"Ooh, and that's some lovely cornering."
00:15:51.600,00:15:52.840,And a perfect dismount.
00:16:02.400,00:16:03.680,A nine for a first-year?
00:16:05.800,00:16:07.600,I hope you aren't going soft.
00:16:29.400,00:16:32.000,"Let's see a sun-wise circle, please, Mildred."
00:16:32.560,00:16:33.960,"Hold on, Tabby."
00:16:39.360,00:16:41.800,And widdershins!
00:16:46.360,00:16:47.720,And land.
00:17:07.000,00:17:09.240,-We passed! -Barely.
00:17:10.839,00:17:14.400,"-We passed! We passed! -Wow, Mildred, you did it."
00:17:16.640,00:17:17.680,You're the bats!
00:17:18.720,00:17:21.320,-That means good. -I'm the bats!
00:17:24.079,00:17:25.520,You're next.
00:17:32.400,00:17:33.760,Take off!
00:17:50.520,00:17:52.640,"No, Midnight, I can't see where we're going!"
00:17:57.040,00:17:59.640,"It really is very disappointing, Maud."
00:17:59.720,00:18:02.680,I hope being head of year hasn't gone to your head.
00:18:02.760,00:18:06.080,"It wasn't Maud's fault, it was her cat."
00:18:06.760,00:18:09.840,"Funny, he's never done that before."
00:18:10.360,00:18:11.600,"No, he hasn't."
00:18:14.160,00:18:17.680,"Why does Maud's cat like you so much, Mildred?"
00:18:17.760,00:18:18.680,I don't know!
00:18:24.280,00:18:26.000,"Tabby, is that you?"
00:18:39.000,00:18:41.040,Somebody switched our cats.
00:18:43.000,00:18:49.680,"Incompetence is one thing, but blatant cheating is much worse."
00:18:49.760,00:18:51.680,Me? You think I did this?
00:18:52.200,00:18:55.320,There is no place for an untrustworthy witch in my school.
00:18:56.520,00:18:57.880,Your trial is over.
00:18:58.680,00:19:01.800,Go to your room and pack.
00:19:13.200,00:19:18.440,Tabby... you have to get out. Sorry.
00:19:24.480,00:19:26.000,This is my fault.
00:19:26.560,00:19:28.360,I should have known it wasn't you.
00:19:29.720,00:19:31.640,No wonder Maud doesn't believe me.
00:19:45.840,00:19:48.440,"I'm sorry, but I had to see you."
00:19:49.000,00:19:50.600,I had to tell you.
00:19:50.680,00:19:52.120,What?
00:19:52.200,00:19:57.080,"I didn't switch the cats, I promise. I would never do that to you."
00:19:57.160,00:20:02.760,"If I had to choose between being a witch and being your friend, I'd choose you every time."
00:20:03.800,00:20:06.800,That's OK. I believe you.
00:20:06.880,00:20:08.360,Really?
00:20:08.440,00:20:11.440,Yeah. That spell was a bit advanced for you.
00:20:17.320,00:20:26.760,"And anyway, I offered to swap, so if you had wanted to, you could have just said yes. So somebody else must have done it."
00:20:26.840,00:20:28.920,No prizes for guessing who.
00:20:29.960,00:20:34.000,Ethel? But she was nice to me yesterday!
00:20:34.920,00:20:38.560,"Well, that definitely counts as suspicious behavior."
00:20:55.240,00:20:57.160,"What are we looking for, exactly?"
00:20:57.560,00:21:01.960,"Evidence. Potions, ingredients, spells."
00:21:29.040,00:21:31.880,An old sardine tin.
00:21:32.240,00:21:35.200,-That's it! -Careful.
00:21:37.160,00:21:38.400,Sorry.
00:21:57.360,00:22:03.120,"If Ethel put a spell on our cats, she'd have to trick them with something they couldn't resist."
00:22:03.200,00:22:05.000,You think she put a spell on the sardines?
00:22:05.080,00:22:07.360,It's evidence. We can take it to Miss Cackle.
00:22:08.040,00:22:11.840,But... what if it's just sardines?
00:22:13.120,00:22:15.880,"Well, there's only one way to find out. There's still some juice left."
00:22:18.800,00:22:23.200,-But if I'm going to be expelled anyway... -Let's both do it.
00:22:29.040,00:22:30.760,"One, two, three..."
00:22:39.080,00:22:40.480,I don't feel anything.
00:22:47.480,00:22:48.320,Ah.
00:22:52.520,00:22:56.240,"Oh, it's OK. Don't panic. Little light, shine bright!"
00:23:00.040,00:23:01.200,Mildred?
00:23:02.400,00:23:03.520,Maud?
00:23:04.600,00:23:07.240,Is... Is that you?
00:23:08.840,00:23:11.000,Is that... me?
00:23:14.800,00:23:18.720,I'm you... and you're me.
00:23:19.440,00:23:21.280,This is so weird.
00:23:22.400,00:23:24.600,-Don't chew my hair. -Sorry!
00:23:26.080,00:23:29.400,"Mildred Hubble, I forbade you to leave your room..."
00:23:30.040,00:23:31.760,but I might've known I'd find you here.
00:23:31.840,00:23:34.440,"-But, Miss Hardbroom-- -Don't interrupt me."
00:23:37.120,00:23:39.200,-What have you done with her? -Sent her to her room.
00:23:39.280,00:23:44.240,"A binding spell will hold her there until the morning, when she will be expelled."
00:23:44.320,00:23:48.040,-But it's not Mildred. -Don't make excuses for her.
00:23:48.120,00:23:53.880,You are confined to your room until the morning and then I hope you will make better friends.
00:24:17.800,00:24:20.040,"Mildred, it's time to go."
00:24:20.120,00:24:22.360,You haven't even packed.
00:24:22.440,00:24:25.760,And what are you doing with Maud's spectacles?
00:24:25.840,00:24:27.920,"I need those, I can't see."
00:24:28.000,00:24:30.880,"Stop play-acting, Mildred Hubble."
00:24:34.880,00:24:38.640,Why do you hate Mildred so much? She can't help who her parents are.
00:24:39.200,00:24:42.800,"I don't hate you, you silly girl, but this is no place for you."
00:24:43.360,00:24:46.600,And I don't want to see you drag Maud Spellbody down with you.
00:24:52.040,00:24:53.320,As I thought.
00:24:53.880,00:24:57.920,This notebook contains a list of ingredients for a switching spell.
00:24:58.600,00:25:00.880,Whose handwriting is this?
00:25:01.840,00:25:03.600,Ethel Hallow's.
00:25:04.160,00:25:06.000,That's what I've been trying to tell you.
00:25:10.040,00:25:13.080,...this is your notebook.
00:25:13.840,00:25:16.560,Did you switch the appearance of the cats?
00:25:18.080,00:25:19.280,Yes.
00:25:20.760,00:25:25.600,Such a dangerous and reckless misuse of magic put the whole school at risk.
00:25:27.160,00:25:29.400,I can think of only one course of action.
00:25:34.880,00:25:38.440,I heard what happened. Please don't expel Ethel.
00:25:38.520,00:25:40.880,I'm sure she wouldn't... There must be some mistake.
00:25:40.960,00:25:45.240,"No, there's no mistake. I did it."
00:25:49.040,00:25:50.840,But only to help Mildred.
00:25:52.560,00:25:53.840,Help her?
00:25:55.560,00:25:56.560,Yes.
00:25:56.920,00:26:00.760,"You see, I knew she'd never pass the test with Tabby, so..."
00:26:01.920,00:26:05.960,I'm really sorry. I meant it for the best.
00:26:07.560,00:26:10.600,She's lying! She doesn't even like Mildred.
00:26:10.680,00:26:11.680,"No, no she's not."
00:26:13.320,00:26:16.800,"Yesterday, Ethel told me she was gonna help Mildred with Tabby."
00:26:18.040,00:26:19.880,"Esmerelda, is this the truth?"
00:26:19.960,00:26:22.720,You're not just saying this because Ethel's your sister?
00:26:23.120,00:26:24.920,"It's true, I swear by the code."
00:26:25.480,00:26:30.760,Why would you help Mildred Hubble? She ruined your entrance exam.
00:26:31.320,00:26:34.280,"She did, but I was wrong."
00:26:35.240,00:26:38.680,She made a mistake. She deserves a second chance.
00:26:40.040,00:26:43.640,"People can change. Look at me, I've changed."
00:26:51.480,00:26:52.400,All right.
00:26:53.760,00:26:59.240,"Ethel, you are forgiven... this time."
00:26:59.320,00:27:00.720,"Yes, Miss Cackle."
00:27:02.400,00:27:08.800,"As for you, Mildred, your trial will continue... if you want it to."
00:27:09.280,00:27:10.880,"Yes, Miss Cackle."
00:27:10.960,00:27:16.200,But that cat must learn to fly. It's our rule.
00:27:16.800,00:27:18.600,"Yes, Miss Hardbroom."
00:27:28.160,00:27:31.840,It's not exactly... elegant.
00:27:31.920,00:27:36.360,But the cat is flying on the broomstick. You can't deny that.
00:27:37.360,00:27:41.360,"Admit it, Hecate, Mildred's been rather clever."
00:27:43.240,00:27:46.160,"Clever, maybe."
00:27:46.240,00:27:51.800,But that's not enough to make her a witch.
00:00:43.200,00:00:47.040,"Millie, you have to wake up! The Great Wizard's coming."
00:00:47.120,00:00:48.200,-Huh? -The Great Wizard!
00:00:48.320,00:00:52.320,"-The Great Wizard as in the Great Wizard! -Yay, wow, amazing!"
00:00:53.440,00:00:55.200,Who's the Great Wizard again?
00:00:55.280,00:00:58.240,And he gave no reason at all of the purpose of his visit?
00:00:58.320,00:01:01.160,The Great Wizard has always been a man of mystery.
00:01:01.240,00:01:07.040,"I remember on one occasion, he turned himself into a chameleon for six weeks to win a simple game of hide-and-seek."
00:01:07.120,00:01:08.400,Impressive!
00:01:08.480,00:01:18.080,"He's like a cross between the Queen and the Prime Minister, but of course he's magic, and he wears a hat instead of a crown."
00:01:18.160,00:01:20.480,-Morning! -Morning.
00:01:20.560,00:01:25.240,I hope the Great Wizard has a good reason for getting us up at this hour.
00:01:25.320,00:01:29.440,But surely his arrival is reason enough. He is the Great Wizard.
00:01:29.520,00:01:36.200,He's basically the most important wizard in the whole wide world.
00:01:37.200,00:01:38.280,You're wearing that?
00:01:39.400,00:01:40.320,Why not?
00:01:41.760,00:01:43.240,You look... great.
00:01:45.880,00:01:50.360,The actual Great Wizard is about to descend upon us and we have yet to organize a greeting ceremony.
00:01:50.440,00:01:52.240,"Oh, there's no need for all that."
00:01:52.320,00:01:54.840,Meeting the first-years will be quite sufficient.
00:01:55.360,00:02:00.480,The Great Wizard is an old family friend. I'm sure he's just popped in to say hello.
00:02:04.840,00:02:07.680,and you're not allowed to speak to him unless he speaks to you.
00:02:08.680,00:02:12.200,And don't shake his hand unless it's a full moon.
00:02:12.280,00:02:13.160,Got it.
00:02:13.800,00:02:16.520,"-So, are you ready? -Nice hat, Mildred!"
00:02:17.000,00:02:19.080,"Where did you get it, a jumble sale?"
00:02:19.160,00:02:21.720,I'm surprised you found a hat big enough to fit your head.
00:02:24.160,00:02:27.640,"Don't worry about him, he's just the Great Wizard. It's no big deal."
00:02:27.720,00:02:29.960,He's the most important wizard in the country.
00:02:31.120,00:02:33.960,My dad once made his trousers disappear for a bet.
00:02:36.720,00:02:37.600,He's here!
00:02:42.640,00:02:44.560,A black cab with no broom?
00:02:44.640,00:02:48.400,-He's here! He's here! -Perhaps he didn't fancy flying today.
00:03:17.200,00:03:21.920,You? You're back in that lay-by recovering from a nice long nap.
00:03:27.120,00:03:29.840,"So, let us proceed straight to the greeting ceremony."
00:03:29.920,00:03:32.760,"Don't worry, we're not going to make you go through all the formalities."
00:03:34.160,00:03:35.960,"-Well, they are traditional. -I know."
00:03:36.720,00:03:42.000,"And you're such a modern great wizard, I knew you wouldn't want any of that old-fashioned nonsense."
00:03:42.080,00:03:47.360,"So there will be no special spells, no songs in your honor, no expensive gifts."
00:03:48.760,00:03:52.440,"Quite. Substance over style. You know me, Miss Cackle."
00:03:52.520,00:03:55.880,"Oh, I do. Shall we meet the girls?"
00:04:01.840,00:04:02.720,Enid Nightshade.
00:04:17.280,00:04:20.640,"W-Well met, uh, Your Highness."
00:04:20.720,00:04:24.040,"Uh, Mr. Wizard, sir?"
00:04:30.800,00:04:33.320,Thank you. I'm sorry.
00:04:35.880,00:04:38.920,and self-control is essential for any witch.
00:04:39.800,00:04:41.320,"Remember that, Mildred Hubble."
00:04:41.400,00:04:46.000,Yes... um... uh... Your Grandness.
00:04:49.520,00:04:53.000,"Well met, Your Greatness. It's such a delight to see you again."
00:04:56.400,00:05:00.720,"Yes, but first, a word, please. In private."
00:05:04.080,00:05:06.200,Witches being turned into frogs?
00:05:06.920,00:05:09.360,Someone wrote you an anonymous letter?
00:05:10.560,00:05:12.720,Surely you're not taking this seriously?
00:05:12.800,00:05:15.920,That depends. Are these claims true or aren't they?
00:05:18.800,00:05:24.520,"There may be some truth in it, but all these incidents are the work of one pupil."
00:05:30.000,00:05:33.280,you have a list of misdemeanors longer than a serpent's tail.
00:05:37.240,00:05:42.400,"-Who wrote this? -Leaving aside the question of authorship, are these allegations true?"
00:05:46.120,00:05:49.640,"but with our help, -I'm sure she will catch up. -Eventually."
00:05:53.120,00:05:54.560,And the safety of the other girls.
00:05:54.640,00:05:57.000,I assume your parents know about your behavior?
00:05:57.880,00:06:00.280,Mum's impressed I got in at all.
00:06:00.360,00:06:03.600,Mildred is our first-ever student from a non-witching family.
00:06:05.760,00:06:08.480,You mean this girl is not a witch?
00:06:14.200,00:06:17.240,"I've always had the greatest respect for you, Ada, but this will not do!"
00:06:17.320,00:06:19.800,No wonder this school is descending into chaos.
00:06:19.880,00:06:21.160,This girl has talent!
00:06:23.840,00:06:26.240,Magic in the wrong hands can be extremely dangerous.
00:06:26.320,00:06:32.800,You of all people should know that. That's why you removed Agatha's powers after that unpleasantness on Selection Day!
00:06:32.880,00:06:38.120,Mildred and my sister are very different people. Very different.
00:06:38.200,00:06:42.600,"That is certainly true, but I think His Greatness is urging us to consider the greater good of the school."
00:06:43.320,00:06:44.360,I am!
00:06:45.240,00:06:49.080,This school needs talented witches no matter what their background!
00:06:49.200,00:06:52.040,I believe that Mildred has that talent.
00:06:52.720,00:06:55.440,I would stake my reputation on it!
00:06:57.040,00:07:00.440,Would you? Indeed.
00:07:07.800,00:07:08.920,"So, who wrote the letter?"
00:07:09.000,00:07:12.080,Never mind that. I've got to practice for this magic display.
00:07:12.640,00:07:14.360,Magic display?
00:07:14.440,00:07:17.040,"Oh, the Great Wizard said I had to prove that I belong here."
00:07:17.120,00:07:19.960,You've got to do magic in front of the Great Wizard?
00:07:21.200,00:07:23.920,"-Oh, Millie! -I know, but..."
00:07:24.800,00:07:27.080,Miss Cackle believes in me. I can't let her down.
00:07:30.680,00:07:34.560,And that's the Goblet of Excellence in the annual spelling bee.
00:07:35.480,00:07:36.560,Impressive.
00:07:37.560,00:07:38.680,Did you win all these?
00:07:40.960,00:07:48.440,"Well, no, my sister did, but-- Oh, Esmerelda, congratulations on all your success."
00:07:48.960,00:07:58.560,"Um, well, Ethel's been doing very well too, I must have spent half my school days flying, sprinting long-distance."
00:07:58.640,00:08:00.200,Oh! Loved it all.
00:08:00.920,00:08:03.080,"And, of course, I was captain of the Display Team."
00:08:03.160,00:08:04.000,Me too.
00:08:07.280,00:08:09.000,"Well, I will be."
00:08:09.080,00:08:11.360,Miss Drill says I'm the best flyer in my year.
00:08:11.440,00:08:14.200,I'm also top in the class in everything else.
00:08:16.400,00:08:19.160,"Would be, if it weren't for Mildred Hubble."
00:08:20.600,00:08:24.680,"Ethie, His Greatness does not want to hear about-- No, actually I do."
00:08:25.440,00:08:29.520,"So... So, what can you tell me about this Mildred Hubble?"
00:08:33.200,00:08:36.880,And she turned me into a pig. I had a snout and a tail for days.
00:08:36.960,00:08:40.240,So would you say that most of the school's problems are down to Mildred Hubble?
00:08:40.320,00:08:42.039,I would say all of them are.
00:08:44.400,00:08:48.320,"Mildred Hubble's not just incompetent, she's a danger to all of us."
00:08:48.400,00:08:49.360,Indeed.
00:08:56.280,00:08:59.600,Maybe you should do something a bit more traditional.
00:08:59.680,00:09:01.240,"But I'm not traditional, am I?"
00:09:01.720,00:09:04.920,Miss Cackle said I should be creative. Watch.
00:09:06.040,00:09:10.560,"Once the beakers are full, point the baton. Then..."
00:09:17.480,00:09:19.600,-Like it? -It's different.
00:09:22.040,00:09:23.880,"The letter to Miss Cackle, I know who wrote it."
00:09:23.960,00:09:25.400,"-Who? -Ethel, of course."
00:09:26.000,00:09:29.560,I heard her talking to the Great Wizard. She's trying to get you expelled.
00:09:29.640,00:09:32.000,I can't believe she actually wrote to the Great Wizard.
00:09:32.080,00:09:35.680,Of course she did. She thinks she can get away with anything because she's a Hallow.
00:09:36.360,00:09:38.880,"Well, she's wrong. I'm not going anywhere."
00:09:39.440,00:09:44.040,"I may not have a magical family, but Miss Cackle believes in me so I know I can do this."
00:09:44.120,00:09:45.640,-So do I. -Me too.
00:10:10.480,00:10:12.160,Where is she?
00:10:15.480,00:10:17.720,I was waiting for you to call me.
00:10:18.280,00:10:20.840,And I forgot Ada had removed all your powers.
00:10:20.920,00:10:23.040,"I know what you meant, you fool."
00:10:27.600,00:10:28.720,Beautifully.
00:10:28.800,00:10:31.680,All those stories you gave me went down a treat.
00:10:43.040,00:10:44.960,I can do this. I can do this.
00:10:45.600,00:10:47.440,"I can do this, I can do..."
00:10:49.560,00:10:50.680,I can't do this.
00:10:57.440,00:11:02.240,"This is a potions display, Miss Cackle, with a twist."
00:11:02.320,00:11:05.640,Intriguing. I knew I was right to have faith in you.
00:11:07.240,00:11:09.720,"Please, sit down, Your Greatness."
00:11:19.200,00:11:21.920,Witches and wizards...
00:11:34.720,00:11:35.680,Ready?
00:11:41.400,00:11:42.680,Here we go.
00:12:22.680,00:12:23.880,Whoops.
00:12:32.920,00:12:33.800,Ada?
00:12:53.240,00:12:57.040,I asked for proof that Mildred is a responsible student. This is what I get?
00:12:57.120,00:12:59.320,-It was a mistake. -Which should never have happened.
00:12:59.400,00:13:01.880,You endanger us all with this reckless misuse of magic.
00:13:01.960,00:13:05.880,"-I'm so sorry, Your Greatness. -It's not your fault, child."
00:13:06.600,00:13:11.200,It's yours. You allowed this display to get out of control.
00:13:12.160,00:13:18.480,"You're obviously unfit to run this school, and I shall ensure that you are removed as soon as possible."
00:13:35.200,00:13:37.120,"Happy now, Ethel? You see what you've done?"
00:13:37.200,00:13:43.600,"I didn't mean... I just wanted to get rid of Mildred, not-- -You shouldn't have written that letter. -What letter?"
00:13:44.280,00:13:45.800,She wrote to the Great Wizard.
00:13:45.880,00:13:49.280,"Thanks to her, Miss Cackle's going to lose her job."
00:13:53.080,00:13:54.400,But... I wouldn't.
00:13:58.640,00:14:01.360,The Cackles have served this academy well for many generations.
00:14:01.440,00:14:03.920,"Well, maybe it's time for the next Cackle to take over."
00:14:04.000,00:14:06.920,I believe your younger sister is next in line!
00:14:07.000,00:14:09.880,"-Oh, no! That's impossible. -Not Agatha."
00:14:11.240,00:14:15.600,I have heard that she's at least three Smarties short of a gingerbread house.
00:14:15.680,00:14:18.640,She'll have us closed down before you could say widdershins.
00:14:18.720,00:14:21.680,"From what I've seen, she could hardly do worse than the current headmistress!"
00:14:22.280,00:14:25.640,I'm afraid Agatha's punishment may have been unjust.
00:14:25.720,00:14:28.400,Perhaps it's time she had her powers returned.
00:14:29.960,00:14:30.920,Your Greatness.
00:14:32.280,00:14:35.840,I have worked with Miss Cackle for many years and I respect her judgment.
00:14:35.920,00:14:40.320,"Even when her decisions appear unusual, they have always proved to be justified."
00:14:41.000,00:14:43.600,She has trained some of the greatest witches of our time.
00:14:43.680,00:14:47.000,Ada Cackle is a force for good...
00:14:47.680,00:14:50.840,"not just for witchcraft, but for the world."
00:14:55.520,00:14:59.160,"-Is this the opinion of you all? -Yes, Your Greatness."
00:15:05.000,00:15:08.400,"Very well, I shall overlook this morning's entertainment..."
00:15:08.960,00:15:12.880,as long as you can persuade me that your judgment is still sound.
00:15:13.280,00:15:15.520,"I will, Your Greatness."
00:15:23.200,00:15:28.120,"This afternoon, our first-years will perform a broomstick display..."
00:15:29.920,00:15:32.280,led by Mildred Hubble.
00:15:35.120,00:15:37.520,I can't fly lead. What if I mess up again?
00:15:37.600,00:15:43.440,"Mildred, when you're down and out, that's the time to rise from the ashes and prove your doubters wrong."
00:15:44.760,00:15:48.840,"Miss Cackle, there's... been a mistake with the broomstick display team."
00:15:51.720,00:15:54.000,Mildred's been listed as lead.
00:15:54.080,00:15:57.920,"That's right, and I want you to lend her your broomstick."
00:15:59.720,00:16:04.040,Yes. We can't expect Mildred to fly on some rickety old duster.
00:16:05.240,00:16:06.560,"You don't mind, do you?"
00:16:11.040,00:16:13.680,"So, off you go. Get practicing."
00:16:13.760,00:16:17.160,Shine like the star you are.
00:16:46.560,00:16:50.040,"Please, Miss Cackle, you can't let Mildred lead."
00:16:50.120,00:16:53.000,But it's very important that she does.
00:16:53.080,00:16:59.360,"You see, I want the Great Wizard to see what Mildred is really capable of."
00:17:00.040,00:17:08.119,The Great Wizard will realize that all our problems come down to one witch and then he will ask me to stay on as headmistress.
00:17:09.840,00:17:10.840,So...
00:17:11.960,00:17:14.520,I think you know what to do.
00:17:15.440,00:17:18.800,"Yes, Miss Cackle. You can count on me."
00:17:20.720,00:17:23.400,Something's not right. It doesn't make sense.
00:17:23.480,00:17:28.680,"Millie, now is not the time to panic. The whole school's counting on you."
00:17:28.760,00:17:33.520,"Take care of this, Mildred. Ethel's very kind to lend it to you."
00:17:33.600,00:17:35.080,"Now, to practice."
00:17:39.760,00:17:43.680,I want you to see to the bat problem in the west turret.
00:17:44.040,00:17:47.160,We don't want any of those pests getting in the way of our flyers.
00:17:48.040,00:17:49.440,But I'll be late for the display.
00:17:51.080,00:17:53.960,"I suspect you'll miss it entirely, but fear not..."
00:17:54.400,00:17:57.000,Miss Drill and I have it all in hand.
00:17:57.600,00:18:06.880,"But, Ada-- Hecate, your impassioned speech was, I'm sure, well-intentioned, but only served to worry the Great Wizard."
00:18:07.720,00:18:10.440,Perhaps best if you stay away now.
00:18:18.920,00:18:24.240,-Miss Hardbroom talked him around. -That interfering old crone.
00:18:26.520,00:18:30.640,I've asked Mildred Hubble to lead a broomstick display.
00:18:30.720,00:18:34.320,It'll be carnage. You're a genius.
00:18:34.400,00:18:36.120,I know.
00:18:36.200,00:18:39.600,"My sister will lose her job, they'll need a new headmistress."
00:18:39.680,00:18:43.720,I'm the next in line. They'll have to give me my powers back.
00:18:43.800,00:18:47.240,I will reinstate you as spell science mistress.
00:18:48.080,00:18:52.120,"I don't think anyone will miss that froggy little fellow, do you?"
00:18:56.200,00:18:59.280,"Or you, do you, sister?"
00:18:59.960,00:19:04.280,"Still, I'm sure you'll enjoy early retirement."
00:19:25.640,00:19:28.760,just close your eyes and tough it out.
00:19:37.840,00:19:42.560,"Um, Miss Cackle, I think you should ask Ethel to fly lead."
00:19:44.200,00:19:45.800,I chose you.
00:19:45.880,00:19:48.720,"I know you're trying to help me, but this is for your sake."
00:19:48.800,00:19:52.440,Do not presume to tell me what is good for me and my school.
00:19:53.400,00:19:58.040,You will get on that broom and you will fly in this display or else there will be consequences.
00:19:59.200,00:20:03.120,"Now, off you go."
00:20:13.160,00:20:17.320,Millie... is everything OK?
00:20:17.400,00:20:20.400,"No, that's not Miss Cackle, that's Agatha."
00:20:21.040,00:20:22.240,"Uh, it can't be."
00:20:22.320,00:20:24.920,She just tried a transference spell and nothing happened.
00:20:25.000,00:20:26.160,Are you sure?
00:20:26.600,00:20:30.280,"She's been trying to make this school look bad all day, and using me."
00:20:30.360,00:20:32.320,"-Uh, Millie-- -Think about it."
00:20:32.400,00:20:37.520,We're about to do a flying display in front of the country's greatest wizard and she chose me to lead it.
00:20:38.280,00:20:40.880,"Oh, my hat! It's Agatha."
00:20:42.640,00:20:44.600,We have to tell the Great Wizard.
00:20:44.680,00:20:47.600,But he's never going to believe us. We have to find the real Miss Cackle.
00:20:47.680,00:20:49.000,"Uh, Mildred Hubble?"
00:20:50.840,00:20:52.400,Where do you think you're going?
00:20:52.920,00:20:56.520,"I, um, just really have to go somewhere."
00:20:56.600,00:20:59.840,"We're all counting on you, Mildred."
00:20:59.920,00:21:02.040,Don't let us down now.
00:21:02.120,00:21:04.880,"Uh... No, she won't."
00:21:04.960,00:21:09.880,"You see, Mildred was, um, just helping me out."
00:21:10.040,00:21:15.840,"You see, I'm having a bit of... tummy trouble."
00:21:15.920,00:21:19.080,"Well, why didn't you say, girls? Maud, you're excused."
00:21:19.160,00:21:21.680,"Enid, you're in."
00:21:23.080,00:21:26.200,"Right, girls, remember what I told you at practice."
00:21:26.280,00:21:31.640,"Lots of height, break for the circle, and, Mildred, really push into that nosedive."
00:21:31.720,00:21:33.600,"-Yes, Miss Drill. -Off you go."
00:21:34.400,00:21:37.280,What's up? What's happened to Maud?
00:21:41.760,00:21:46.080,We have to get this display right or the Great Wizard will get rid of our Miss Cackle.
00:21:47.960,00:21:51.760,Mildred flying lead in a broomstick display. Ambitious.
00:21:51.840,00:21:52.720,It'll come off.
00:21:54.880,00:21:56.640,My girls will make sure of it.
00:22:01.640,00:22:03.480,Are you sure this is a good idea?
00:22:03.560,00:22:05.520,It's what Miss Cackle wants.
00:22:05.600,00:22:08.560,The Great Wizard wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Mildred.
00:22:08.640,00:22:11.480,It's time to get her out of the way for good.
00:22:46.040,00:22:47.240,This is bad.
00:22:47.320,00:22:50.840,I sense a spell at work. This is definitely bad.
00:22:50.920,00:22:52.560,"I'm not ashamed to admit when I'm wrong, Ada."
00:22:53.320,00:22:57.120,"Those girls are doing you proud, even Mildred Hubble."
00:23:06.040,00:23:08.640,How do you know Miss Cackle's really Agatha?
00:23:08.720,00:23:11.680,She's got no magic. Whoa!
00:23:14.080,00:23:16.600,The broomstick. There's something wrong with it.
00:23:19.720,00:23:21.960,Mildred!
00:23:32.160,00:23:35.320,"Come on, Maud, Mildred's counting on you."
00:23:40.880,00:23:42.000,Whoa!
00:23:47.880,00:23:49.640,"Come on, you stupid..."
00:23:56.320,00:24:01.160,"Oh! Miss Cackle, I'm so sorry."
00:24:05.040,00:24:06.480,Miss Cackle.
00:24:18.160,00:24:19.800,It's an entrancement spell.
00:24:23.960,00:24:26.760,"Mildred Hubble, what are you playing at?"
00:24:29.840,00:24:32.160,How do I reverse an enchantment spell?
00:24:32.240,00:24:35.960,"Come on, brain, it's a basic reversal. Um..."
00:24:37.080,00:24:40.960,"Flash of light, crash of thunder, wake this witch from her slumber."
00:24:42.280,00:24:43.840,Oh! I forgot to do the fingers.
00:24:53.200,00:24:54.600,"Oh, dear."
00:24:55.400,00:24:57.160,Have I been asleep long?
00:24:59.880,00:25:01.080,Is she all right?
00:25:02.000,00:25:04.720,It seems Miss Hubble has decided to show off.
00:25:43.400,00:25:46.600,"Uh, we can still fly without the end bit, can't we?"
00:25:47.960,00:25:48.960,No!
00:25:52.560,00:25:55.640,What on earth is going on? It's a debacle.
00:25:55.720,00:25:59.200,"I couldn't agree more. Could you, Agatha?"
00:26:00.360,00:26:01.320,Agatha?
00:26:01.840,00:26:04.720,Don't be absurd. I'm Ada.
00:26:04.800,00:26:08.840,"-No, I'm Ada. -Well, there's an easy way to settle this."
00:26:08.920,00:26:09.920,Agatha has no powers.
00:26:10.000,00:26:13.840,"Whichever one of you is the true headmistress, save those girls."
00:26:24.520,00:26:26.080,I was just about to do that.
00:26:34.360,00:26:40.200,"Then, when things got nasty and I tried an entrancement spell, she bounced it back at me with a pocket mirror."
00:26:40.760,00:26:43.680,"-Quite clever, really. -And she wrote the letter?"
00:26:43.760,00:26:50.200,"Hoping you'd have a disastrous visit, close the school, and she could take my place as headteacher."
00:26:50.280,00:26:54.640,But at least now she is somewhere she cannot do any harm.
00:26:58.520,00:27:00.840,"Where are you, Miss Gullet?"
00:27:11.680,00:27:14.240,"Well, Mildred Hubble, I obviously underestimated you."
00:27:14.320,00:27:20.920,"You'll make a fine witch one day. And you deserve your place here, even though you're the worst flyer I've ever seen."
00:27:21.000,00:27:22.480,That's not Mildred's fault.
00:27:22.560,00:27:25.920,-Ethel put a spell on the broomstick. -She told me to.
00:27:28.160,00:27:30.960,"I mean, Agatha told me to."
00:27:31.040,00:27:36.680,"Indeed she did, but it is worth pointing out that you could have said no."
00:27:37.600,00:27:40.640,"Well, I suggest we all adjourn for tea and crumpets."
00:27:40.720,00:27:43.680,"Perhaps you girls would like to join us? You too, Ethel."
00:27:44.360,00:27:46.720,You obviously need help with your behavior.
00:27:46.800,00:27:49.360,And I hope these three will be a good influence.
00:01:39.320,00:01:40.560,Whoa!
00:01:43.040,00:01:44.920,"You thought I was gonna drop this, didn't you?"
00:02:03.640,00:02:05.200,"Wow, thanks, Esmeralda!"
00:02:13.040,00:02:16.640,"-I'm such an idiot! -No, you're not."
00:02:20.720,00:02:25.680,"Imagine being her, just basically being the best witch in the academy."
00:02:28.520,00:02:32.240,we are what we are and that's never going to change.
00:02:35.160,00:02:39.040,Every year group is to go to their next class immediately!
00:02:55.760,00:02:57.400,"-What is it, Miss Cackle? -They're back."
00:02:57.480,00:02:59.680,-What are? -The mists of time.
00:03:00.240,00:03:01.640,"Ooh, a mist! We're done for!"
00:03:03.400,00:03:04.880,"I'll be two minutes, Miss Cackle."
00:03:04.960,00:03:07.160,Nightstar's still out there. I better go and find her.
00:03:07.240,00:03:10.160,"Too late, Ethel. All exits have been sealed."
00:03:10.240,00:03:12.480,"Miss Hardbroom, if you could come with me?"
00:03:12.560,00:03:15.280,"Miss Drill, if you could look after the first-years."
00:03:15.360,00:03:17.320,"Certainly, Miss Cackle. Come on, quick, sharp!"
00:03:17.400,00:03:19.720,But what if Nightstar can't find her way back?
00:03:19.800,00:03:22.280,You couldn't get out even if you wanted to.
00:03:24.640,00:03:26.000,I know a way.
00:03:29.280,00:03:30.320,Ethel!
00:03:31.560,00:03:33.880,We'll be back before anyone even notices we've gone.
00:03:34.360,00:03:35.560,Come on.
00:03:50.040,00:03:51.240,"All right, up here!"
00:04:07.600,00:04:08.680,Nightstar?
00:04:10.640,00:04:12.040,Nightstar!
00:04:12.600,00:04:14.600,"-Felicity Foxglove? -Here, Miss Drill."
00:04:14.680,00:04:15.840,Ethel Hallow?
00:04:17.480,00:04:18.600,Ethel Hallow?
00:04:19.959,00:04:23.040,"Excuse me, Miss Drill... Uh... Uh..."
00:04:23.720,00:04:26.360,"What's so bad about going out into a mist, anyway?"
00:04:26.440,00:04:30.280,"Believe me, girls, this is not just a mist."
00:04:30.880,00:04:33.000,It is the mist.
00:04:33.880,00:04:37.440,"If anyone were to enter, the consequences could be truly..."
00:04:38.600,00:04:39.840,"Hold on, where is Ethel?"
00:04:41.360,00:04:42.760,And where is Mildred Hubble?
00:04:54.560,00:04:59.320,Oh! She likes her breakfast... to go!
00:04:59.400,00:05:02.760,"Well, if Nightstar's gone back inside, we'd better do the same."
00:05:03.160,00:05:05.480,"We can't leave them out there, it's far too dangerous."
00:05:05.560,00:05:08.640,"If you follow them, you could make everything worse!"
00:05:08.720,00:05:11.640,I remember what happened when the mists last descended.
00:05:11.720,00:05:14.160,It changed everything between Agatha and me.
00:05:18.320,00:05:25.600,"As long as Mildred and Ethel come back into the building at exactly the same place they left it, there really is nothing to worry about."
00:05:50.400,00:05:52.280,We're going to have to find another way back in.
00:06:12.200,00:06:17.120,"Mildred, you didn't have to help me then, so I just wanted to say-- Shh!"
00:06:22.720,00:06:23.600,Mona.
00:06:24.520,00:06:27.440,Did anyone tell you this whole place is on lockdown?
00:06:29.160,00:06:30.200,Who are they?
00:06:31.640,00:06:33.440,We're in Miss Hardbroom's year.
00:06:35.080,00:06:36.160,Never heard of her.
00:06:37.520,00:06:38.960,-You new? -No.
00:06:39.600,00:06:42.440,But you must be if you've never heard of HB.
00:06:43.160,00:06:45.600,I suppose you've never heard of Miss Cackle either...
00:06:56.960,00:06:58.080,Mrs. Alma!
00:07:00.000,00:07:01.640,What happened to Miss Ada?
00:07:14.400,00:07:15.480,"-Ada! -Yes, Mum?"
00:07:24.000,00:07:29.000,Those weren't any old twins. They were Miss Cackle and Agatha.
00:07:30.480,00:07:32.200,And Mona was Maud's grandma!
00:07:38.040,00:07:39.760,We've... We've gone back in time!
00:07:40.840,00:07:43.480,This isn't the Cackle's of the present.
00:07:44.480,00:07:46.400,This is the Cackle's of the past.
00:07:46.480,00:07:50.440,"They say that in every school, there's always one, but in ours there are two!"
00:07:50.520,00:07:53.240,And they both just happen to be my daughters.
00:07:53.720,00:08:01.200,"I've long since despaired of you, Agatha, but now your behavior seems to be rubbing off on your sister and your friend too!"
00:08:01.560,00:08:05.520,"Ada, as the eldest, I expect a lot better from you!"
00:08:06.960,00:08:09.760,I'm only 13 minutes older!
00:08:09.840,00:08:13.880,You entered my study without my permission and tried to take my spell book!
00:08:13.960,00:08:17.040,We thought some magic would liven class up a bit!
00:08:17.760,00:08:21.880,Being stuck in all morning because of the stupid mist is boring!
00:08:23.120,00:08:27.800,this is the perfect opportunity to take the official year group photograph!
00:08:31.600,00:08:35.919,"Just because you're my heir, Ada, does not mean you will take over this place whatever."
00:08:36.000,00:08:40.799,"Yes, it does! And she's going to let me run it with her."
00:08:43.679,00:08:50.200,"If any of you three set foot in here again, you will be excluded permanently!"
00:08:50.280,00:08:51.280,And the academy...
00:08:52.640,00:08:54.600,will never be yours!
00:09:03.880,00:09:06.560,I don't believe it. it's Miss Drill too!
00:09:07.640,00:09:10.080,Except I suppose it isn't.
00:09:10.160,00:09:12.000,It must be her mum instead.
00:09:13.560,00:09:15.640,The mists of time.
00:09:16.400,00:09:24.040,"Many moons ago, a Great Wizard enchanted a thick mist so he could step between that and the last such mist to have descended."
00:09:24.120,00:09:29.160,"But no one should ever meddle with time, and after he'd entered it, he was never seen again."
00:09:29.240,00:09:30.320,Oh!
00:09:31.080,00:09:39.360,Such mists come and go within minutes and anyone finding themselves in the wrong moment of history when they fade will be trapped there for eternity.
00:09:41.120,00:09:42.680,Does it tell us how to get back?
00:09:46.200,00:09:48.600,What if we're trapped like that Great Wizard?
00:09:49.280,00:09:52.400,What if I never get to see Mum or Maud or Tabby again?
00:09:57.800,00:09:59.000,with you?
00:10:05.040,00:10:07.000,So now she's more lost than ever.
00:10:07.800,00:10:09.120,We're going to need help.
00:10:09.680,00:10:13.320,"Even if we do find her, we still won't know how to get home."
00:10:14.360,00:10:16.000,But I know someone who will.
00:10:20.960,00:10:22.040,Mildred!
00:10:23.000,00:10:25.600,This is no time for vandalism!
00:10:25.680,00:10:30.440,"Actually, Ethel, it's the perfect time."
00:10:41.880,00:10:43.080,Um...
00:10:43.800,00:10:44.640,Ah!
00:10:45.520,00:10:47.080,Right. Uh...
00:10:48.160,00:10:52.240,"Loretta, if you could take a seat there next to Felicia, please, and just move in."
00:10:54.120,00:10:55.560,-Mrs. Cackle. -Marvelous!
00:10:56.560,00:10:57.880,Hmm. Gorgeous.
00:10:57.960,00:10:59.600,-Would you like to...? -Absolutely!
00:11:02.240,00:11:03.440,-In the top. -Oh!
00:11:09.120,00:11:10.280,-Marvelous! -Yeah!
00:11:10.360,00:11:12.240,-Marvelous. -Great. OK.
00:11:12.600,00:11:13.680,OK.
00:11:14.280,00:11:16.120,"And uh... collars, ladies."
00:11:17.560,00:11:19.200,-What are we going to do now? -Well...
00:11:19.920,00:11:22.920,"We either do exactly as Mother says, or..."
00:11:25.520,00:11:32.360,"She has so much power, -So why don't we take some? -An extraction spell?"
00:11:33.600,00:11:37.560,"If she had a teeny bit less, it wouldn't make any difference to her."
00:11:37.640,00:11:42.240,"But if we had a teeny bit more, she might finally start respecting us as witches."
00:11:43.280,00:11:45.000,"You'd need her spell book for that, though."
00:11:45.520,00:11:48.000,And you know what she says about us going in her study.
00:11:48.880,00:11:53.360,Which means we have to find someone else to go in there for us.
00:11:54.040,00:11:55.280,The new girls!
00:11:55.840,00:11:58.560,-We need your help. -Me?
00:11:59.080,00:12:03.160,"Wouldn't matter what time I was in, I'd always trust a Spellbody."
00:12:03.240,00:12:05.400,We know you're not supposed to leave this room...
00:12:05.880,00:12:07.600,but I've lost my cat.
00:12:07.680,00:12:12.160,"And if we don't find her before the mists lift, you're going to be seeing a lot more of us."
00:12:22.200,00:12:25.400,But only if you help us too.
00:12:30.920,00:12:32.040,Ah!
00:12:41.760,00:12:43.960,"Please tell us what's going on, Miss Drill."
00:12:44.040,00:12:46.760,Are Mildred and Ethel in some sort of danger?
00:12:46.840,00:12:50.160,"No, they'll be back any minute."
00:12:50.680,00:12:52.680,"Please, girls, just get on with your work."
00:12:57.080,00:12:59.480,Help! We're stuck in the past.
00:13:14.360,00:13:16.520,Aren't we going to get in trouble for this?
00:13:16.600,00:13:19.160,No more trouble than we'll get into for looking for your cat.
00:13:20.520,00:13:21.920,"Come on, Mildred."
00:13:39.120,00:13:41.080,And a lot more in yours than hers.
00:13:42.320,00:13:44.440,Typical big-sister favoritism.
00:13:45.120,00:13:46.200,Exactly!
00:14:00.320,00:14:01.880,"Well, this is."
00:14:02.440,00:14:07.120,Alma Cackle's little book of spells and potions. Private and confidential.
00:14:08.160,00:14:09.040,Right.
00:14:10.080,00:14:11.160,Let's find Nightstar!
00:14:12.320,00:14:13.280,I don't think so!
00:14:14.040,00:14:15.240,You promised.
00:14:15.320,00:14:17.800,"You don't know me very well, do you?"
00:14:21.040,00:14:22.760,"Mona, please, you have to help us."
00:14:24.520,00:14:25.360,Why?
00:14:26.040,00:14:30.120,"Don't tell her, Mildred. We can't tinker with time, remember?"
00:14:30.600,00:14:31.440,Because...
00:14:46.640,00:14:52.680,"Now gather your things immediately. And as for you-- -Ethel, the mists are clearing. -Do you even go to this school?"
00:14:56.080,00:14:59.480,Desk graffiti is hardly evidence. Anyone could have done it.
00:14:59.560,00:15:05.840,The fact is we still have no idea whether Mildred and Ethel are actually in the past or not.
00:15:07.640,00:15:09.280,"Oh, yes, we do!"
00:15:27.040,00:15:28.520,"No, it wasn't!"
00:15:28.600,00:15:32.040,"And if Mona really is expelled, it could change her whole life."
00:15:32.920,00:15:35.920,"And if her life changes, so will Maud's."
00:15:36.000,00:15:38.320,It could turn her into someone else entirely.
00:15:50.680,00:15:52.680,"What are you looking at, Frightshade?"
00:15:53.120,00:15:59.240,"If you want a spell bashing from the Spellbody, you're going the right way about it!"
00:16:10.400,00:16:16.600,"I've got Grandma Mona expelled, messed up the present, and now we're about to be trapped in the past forever."
00:16:16.680,00:16:19.920,"Oh, dear! That doesn't sound like the best day's work, Mildred."
00:16:21.000,00:16:23.840,-You came! -Do you know how we get out of here?
00:16:24.360,00:16:28.880,"If your hand be not visible in front of your face, step back into a forgotten place."
00:16:28.960,00:16:34.160,"To return, retrace your steps and walk from the last mist into the next."
00:16:35.000,00:16:37.160,So we need to go back outside...
00:16:37.720,00:16:40.640,and then come back in the same way we left?
00:16:40.720,00:16:41.840,"Yes, Mildred, you do."
00:16:42.280,00:16:47.040,"But now I've moved in time, I can't move us in space, so you need to get a move on."
00:16:47.120,00:16:50.440,We can't go yet. We still haven't found Nightstar!
00:16:50.520,00:16:55.440,"I'm sorry, Ethel, but I need to get you two through that grate before the mists disappear completely."
00:16:55.520,00:16:56.720,What about you?
00:16:57.360,00:17:04.240,Sounds like I'm going to have to persuade my mother to change her mind about Mona before we're lumbered with a different Maud and... a different everybody.
00:17:14.400,00:17:17.880,"Is there anything else, anything at all you've disrupted or disturbed?"
00:17:22.520,00:17:24.760,Good! Now come on!
00:17:37.080,00:17:39.720,"Hey, we only need two of those!"
00:17:40.840,00:17:45.560,"I'm tripling every ingredient. In fact, I'm timesing them by ten."
00:17:46.680,00:17:47.520,Why?
00:17:48.080,00:17:50.600,We're not just going to take some of Mother's powers...
00:17:51.160,00:17:54.120,-we're going to take all of it! -We can't do that!
00:17:56.920,00:17:59.480,We're just speeding up the process.
00:17:59.560,00:18:01.760,We're not old enough to be headteachers yet.
00:18:01.840,00:18:07.720,"Imagine it, a school without rules, where the pupils are in charge and not the staff."
00:18:08.200,00:18:11.080,"No, Agatha, I can't do that to Mother!"
00:18:11.800,00:18:16.280,"Well, forget who's the eldest. I'm going to run this place on my own."
00:18:41.160,00:18:43.080,It worked!
00:18:45.680,00:18:46.680,Mildred.
00:18:48.080,00:18:52.080,"I didn't want to say anything in front of Ethel, but there is one more thing."
00:18:53.040,00:18:55.240,Something I've taken from your mother's study.
00:18:55.760,00:18:58.640,"-Stolen? -Yes, but I did it for you."
00:19:00.240,00:19:03.520,"It's your birth scroll, and there's something you need to know."
00:19:05.800,00:19:08.400,"You're not the oldest, Agatha is."
00:19:09.080,00:19:11.200,She was born 13 minutes before you.
00:19:11.280,00:19:13.360,Your mother just told you it was the other way around.
00:19:14.280,00:19:16.120,Then Cackle's is rightfully hers!
00:19:21.120,00:19:22.600,You need to go in too!
00:19:23.200,00:19:25.360,Will you make sure Mona's allowed to stay?
00:19:28.200,00:19:32.400,"My sister is about to throw everything away, so I must try to stop her!"
00:19:34.280,00:19:36.200,No one should meddle with time.
00:19:52.240,00:19:53.440,Mona!
00:19:55.680,00:19:58.280,"You're not going home, you're coming with me!"
00:20:04.760,00:20:05.800,Who are you?
00:20:09.400,00:20:11.240,-We can't mess anything else up. -I'm not.
00:20:11.760,00:20:13.520,I'm fixing things.
00:20:13.880,00:20:16.920,I'll tell you who I am. I'm you.
00:20:19.160,00:20:22.080,"You can't handle Mother's power, you're not ready."
00:20:22.160,00:20:25.760,The potion will just explode and you'll be sent to Wormwood's Academy.
00:20:26.680,00:20:29.440,Only the wickedest of witches end up there.
00:20:32.040,00:20:33.680,whereas I'll go on to be head girl.
00:20:34.360,00:20:38.200,"And when we do run this place together, that will be a disaster too."
00:20:39.000,00:20:41.040,"It doesn't have to be that way, though."
00:20:42.160,00:20:43.880,"Put the bag down, Agatha."
00:20:45.680,00:20:47.720,Let's rewrite history.
00:20:56.960,00:21:01.560,I don't want to be head girl and I definitely don't want to be you!
00:21:02.320,00:21:06.640,If you're not going to take Mother's powers... then I am!
00:21:09.480,00:21:12.040,"You've not persuaded your sister to be good, Miss Cackle."
00:21:12.120,00:21:14.480,You've just turned your younger self bad!
00:21:14.560,00:21:15.880,Where's Ada gone?
00:21:15.960,00:21:18.200,The junk room. It's where we always go.
00:21:18.280,00:21:19.640,Your bedroom!
00:21:20.160,00:21:24.720,"Mona being expelled was bad enough, but if you're expelled too, it would change everything!"
00:21:25.760,00:21:36.280,"I'm warning you, if you don't get to work this minute, you will be spending the entire afternoon outside Miss Cackle's door, again!"
00:21:36.800,00:21:39.800,"All right, Miss Drill, take a chill-out potion."
00:21:43.400,00:21:46.400,Maud! Miss Cackle's about to change everything.
00:21:46.480,00:21:48.280,Tell Miss Drill. Mildred.
00:21:48.360,00:21:50.880,Why would Mildred Hubble ask you for help?
00:21:50.960,00:21:54.360,"Well, she can't really ask a friend, can she? She hasn't got any!"
00:21:54.440,00:21:55.720,"What is it now, Maud?"
00:22:01.520,00:22:03.760,"Nothing, Miss Drill."
00:22:06.120,00:22:09.400,Nothing at all.
00:22:18.400,00:22:21.400,Same as me. Someone from Cackle's future.
00:22:21.960,00:22:23.040,Mother...
00:22:24.440,00:22:25.880,it's Ada.
00:22:28.640,00:22:29.800,The mists!
00:22:31.400,00:22:35.000,"And if you don't help us, we won't have a school to return to."
00:22:44.560,00:22:54.760,Make mother's magic mine and give me her-- I'm not interested in anything you have to say!
00:22:54.840,00:22:56.320,Then what about me?
00:22:56.520,00:22:58.280,I didn't want you to know about the future...
00:22:59.200,00:23:01.520,"but now you do, there's more you need to know too."
00:23:02.320,00:23:05.720,I'm not a good witch. I might even be the worst one ever.
00:23:06.520,00:23:08.400,But you've never stopped believing in me.
00:23:09.520,00:23:13.400,"You don't just go on to become a head, you go on to become a great one."
00:23:14.280,00:23:16.400,"You're a good person, Ada."
00:23:16.480,00:23:20.080,"So please, please don't do this."
00:23:21.640,00:23:22.680,It's not you.
00:23:42.080,00:23:46.120,I knew you wouldn't go through with this! But I will!
00:23:47.560,00:23:52.080,Make Mother's magic mine and give me her power!
00:23:52.160,00:23:53.040,Watch out!
00:23:59.680,00:24:02.000,-Where are Mildred and Miss Cackle? -I wish we knew.
00:24:02.080,00:24:04.680,We couldn't even find Nightstar.
00:24:04.760,00:24:06.800,"Well, well, well!"
00:24:07.800,00:24:12.200,-Look what the black cat dragged in. -Ethel Shallow.
00:24:14.840,00:24:19.080,"Oh, no! Mona being expelled really has changed things."
00:24:19.640,00:24:21.120,No one even knows it.
00:24:21.200,00:24:23.960,"Don't worry, we had much the same trouble with her mother."
00:24:25.240,00:24:26.440,Not even you!
00:24:33.680,00:24:36.560,Why did you lie to us? I've seen the scroll.
00:24:40.280,00:24:44.040,"You and Agatha might be identical, but you've always been so different."
00:24:44.560,00:24:49.560,"I knew that if she inherited the school, she'd never stick to the values on which it's built!"
00:24:50.160,00:24:54.080,"This place needs you. Now go, quickly."
00:24:54.160,00:24:55.760,There is just one more thing.
00:24:56.280,00:24:59.680,"Please, don't expel Mona. It isn't meant to happen."
00:25:01.000,00:25:05.200,"Agatha, you're going to Wormwood's. And you..."
00:25:14.400,00:25:18.160,"Oh, come on, Mildred, what would I do without you?"
00:25:18.240,00:25:19.800,You're the best friend I ever had!
00:25:22.640,00:25:25.440,"Ethel, I am so glad you're back. I was so worried."
00:25:25.520,00:25:27.360,"Oh, here, take a seat."
00:25:27.440,00:25:30.000,"Take my seat, whatever."
00:25:30.440,00:25:32.480,I just wish we knew what was going on.
00:25:34.440,00:25:35.680,I think I do.
00:25:36.480,00:25:38.160,Mildred's put things right.
00:25:38.600,00:25:42.000,"Now she just needs to get out of there, while she still can."
00:25:55.440,00:25:56.640,Nightstar!
00:25:57.400,00:26:01.960,So that's why you didn't come when Ethel called! You were with her nan!
00:26:16.840,00:26:18.280,I thought she was behind me!
00:26:19.400,00:26:20.800,But when I turned around...
00:26:21.360,00:26:23.440,So I'm never going to see her again?
00:26:30.840,00:26:33.120,Ah! Doesn't time fly when you're having fun?
00:26:33.200,00:26:34.800,-Mildred! -Nightstar!
00:26:34.880,00:26:35.960,-Mildred! -Mildred!
00:26:36.040,00:26:36.960,She's here!
00:26:40.520,00:26:42.440,"Your gran seems nice, Ethel."
00:26:43.600,00:26:46.040,"And do you know what, Maud? I think yours will be too now."
00:26:48.640,00:26:52.040,-But I'm not sure if she's right. -About what?
00:26:53.360,00:26:55.040,Anyone can change.
00:26:55.720,00:27:00.360,"I mean, I have seen the naughtiest of witches become the nicest."
00:27:00.440,00:27:04.960,So who knows? Maybe one day even the worst might become the very best!
00:27:09.960,00:27:14.720,"I'm so sorry about going out into the mists, but I can make it up to you."
00:27:21.640,00:27:22.960,I won't say a word.
00:27:23.040,00:27:25.440,I know the future of this school depends on it.
00:27:29.600,00:27:32.520,And why didn't you come back when I did?
00:27:32.600,00:27:33.680,What's been going on?
00:27:37.120,00:27:41.320,"Oh, it's nothing to worry about, girls, is it, Mildred?"
00:27:41.400,00:27:42.520,"No, Miss Cackle."
00:27:43.120,00:27:44.760,It's all in the past now.
00:27:45.480,00:27:47.960,Lost in the mists of time.
00:00:39.840,00:00:41.720,It's so crafty!
00:00:41.800,00:00:43.320,I just woke up like this.
00:00:43.400,00:00:45.560,"Whatever you do, don't look at Ethel's face."
00:00:48.280,00:00:49.280,Maud!
00:00:49.960,00:00:53.360,-What? It's not as if I can miss it. -I know.
00:00:53.440,00:00:55.360,-Poor Ethel. -Do you want something?
00:00:55.440,00:00:59.400,"Um, you've got something kind of growing on your face."
00:00:59.480,00:01:01.720,You mean my wart?
00:01:01.800,00:01:05.840,Um... maybe you should see the nurse. You might better get rid of it.
00:01:06.840,00:01:10.040,"Actually, Mildred, uh, warts are special for us."
00:01:12.080,00:01:14.400,Being you must be exhausting.
00:01:24.240,00:01:27.560,You get a lump on your face and suddenly you're the bat's pajamas.
00:01:27.640,00:01:31.080,Not quite. The last wart I saw was my great-great-grandma's...
00:01:31.480,00:01:33.080,smack-bang on the end of her nose.
00:01:33.160,00:01:35.400,"Ethel looks like an old lady, and she's glad."
00:01:35.480,00:01:38.520,"Well, it's a sign of a really powerful witch."
00:01:38.880,00:01:40.840,"They're crazy rare nowadays, though."
00:01:42.440,00:01:45.960,I wish I had a great-great-grandma witch to teach me all this stuff.
00:01:47.440,00:01:51.960,"Ethel's right, isn't she? I'll never catch up with you lot."
00:01:55.760,00:01:57.600,"Tell us how you got it, Ethel, please?"
00:01:58.480,00:02:01.480,-Was it special soap? -Face yoga?
00:02:01.560,00:02:04.600,"-Ooh, toad-infused moisturizer? -No, no, no!"
00:02:10.680,00:02:13.040,-You're learning loads. -Yeah. Take today.
00:02:13.120,00:02:15.880,I've learned that warts are old-fashioned and trendy at the same time.
00:02:16.440,00:02:18.440,I suppose our world can be quite confusing.
00:02:19.800,00:02:21.000,You're doing your hair.
00:02:21.320,00:02:25.480,"To me, that means you want your bunches extra curly, but in witch world...?"
00:02:25.560,00:02:27.840,I want my bunches extra curly.
00:02:27.920,00:02:29.360,Bad example.
00:02:29.800,00:02:32.400,"But if I was a proper witch, I'd already know all these things."
00:02:33.680,00:02:36.640,You are a proper witch. Fact.
00:02:44.800,00:02:49.960,"So as a witch, someone somewhere in your mum's family..."
00:02:50.680,00:02:52.120,"must have been one, too."
00:02:52.840,00:02:55.200,A Brief Witchory of the World?
00:02:55.520,00:02:58.160,If you have any witching ancestors...
00:03:01.720,00:03:04.320,If you get magic from your mum and my mum hasn't got any...
00:03:04.400,00:03:07.760,-Maybe it skipped her somehow. -Magic can do that?
00:03:09.080,00:03:12.040,Magic can do whatever it wants.
00:03:14.400,00:03:15.440,Foot skin scrub?
00:03:15.960,00:03:17.240,Fungus face mask.
00:03:17.800,00:03:19.800,"I told you, I didn't do anything."
00:03:20.360,00:03:24.000,Try not to be jealous. You can't all be perfect like me.
00:03:27.840,00:03:34.040,But we could be. I found an ancient book and made this when Ethel showed me her wart before breakfast.
00:03:34.120,00:03:36.680,Wart encouraging potion.
00:03:36.760,00:03:39.360,"Apparently, it sucks them right up out of your face."
00:03:39.440,00:03:41.720,Oi! Give that back!
00:03:49.640,00:03:53.800,"-Spill. -Um, Ethel has a wart, and everyone else wants one, too."
00:04:02.600,00:04:05.480,"I don't suppose you know a speed-reading spell, do you?"
00:04:12.880,00:04:14.480,Better get a move on. Ow!
00:04:17.680,00:04:21.519,"Prepare to be astounded, girls..."
00:04:21.920,00:04:27.840,for today we will be diving into the fascinating physics of flying!
00:04:32.040,00:04:35.640,"Mildred, you're late and a tad overdressed."
00:04:36.160,00:04:39.520,"I think better with a warm brain, sir."
00:04:39.600,00:04:43.720,"Well, I'm gonna have to give you and your cozy cranium a late mark."
00:04:43.800,00:04:49.320,"Page 47, copy the paragraph flying in inclement weather."
00:04:51.480,00:04:54.480,"Sorry, I got caught up. I'm not having the best morning."
00:04:56.080,00:04:57.040,Ah.
00:04:58.000,00:05:02.080,Feeling a bit green are we? Froggy?
00:05:02.160,00:05:04.640,"Not quite as bad as that, but close."
00:05:05.600,00:05:07.600,"Well, I'll let you off this time."
00:05:08.240,00:05:11.880,"If you feel the urge, I've got an emergency bottle of flies in my drawer."
00:05:13.680,00:05:14.520,Thanks.
00:05:31.640,00:05:34.560,When my own hair turned against me.
00:05:42.880,00:05:45.320,I'm sorry if I upset you before.
00:05:45.920,00:05:48.160,-Congrats on the wart and everything. -Thanks.
00:05:49.440,00:05:52.520,"I wanted to apologize, too, actually, for making fun of you."
00:05:52.600,00:05:58.200,"-It's not your fault you don't know much. -Thanks, I think."
00:05:58.600,00:06:00.680,Does wart palm make you nicer or something?
00:06:00.760,00:06:02.640,It will make me fix that tangle quicker.
00:06:02.720,00:06:07.120,Um... We were about to go to the library for a removal spell anyway.
00:06:07.200,00:06:10.160,Removal? She'll end up bald.
00:06:10.240,00:06:12.640,You need something gentle. I know just the thing.
00:06:19.880,00:06:24.120,"Ethel Hallow, you are the cruelest, nastiest, most horrible-- Silence!"
00:06:25.400,00:06:28.400,"Who can quote me the Witches' Code, section 97, clause four?"
00:06:28.960,00:06:30.840,Never put a cat in a cauldron.
00:06:30.920,00:06:33.600,-Never feed dragons after midnight. -Ethel?
00:06:34.440,00:06:41.400,"Never remove any part of another witch's anatomy, be it arm, leg or hair of head."
00:06:41.480,00:06:43.000,Precisely.
00:06:44.320,00:06:46.600,"Miss Cackle's office, both of you."
00:06:47.840,00:06:49.360,Now.
00:06:51.920,00:06:58.840,"Ethel, the last time you attempted to help Mildred, we had a most dreadful kerfuffle and two very confused cats."
00:06:58.920,00:07:02.640,Let's not forget Mildred's catalog of misdemeanors.
00:07:04.440,00:07:07.480,The two of you seem to be stuck in something of a vicious circle.
00:07:08.600,00:07:09.880,It's time you put a stop to it.
00:07:11.120,00:07:13.920,You're to keep away from each other for the time being.
00:07:15.080,00:07:17.520,"Ethel, I'll be needing those scissors."
00:07:35.360,00:07:38.040,"Could I please make a suggestion, Miss Cackle?"
00:07:38.120,00:07:40.480,"-That we let off your sister lightly? -No, not at all."
00:07:40.560,00:07:42.400,She's getting far too big for her broomstick.
00:07:42.480,00:07:44.720,And the other first-years aren't far behind.
00:07:44.800,00:07:46.360,It's every girl for herself.
00:07:46.440,00:07:50.160,"A touch of friendly competition never hurt anyone, you know that, Esmeralda."
00:07:50.240,00:07:52.560,I'm not sure this could be described as friendly.
00:07:52.640,00:07:54.960,I had an idea of how to make things better.
00:07:55.640,00:07:57.000,"It's a little drastic, though."
00:08:03.440,00:08:05.480,you cannot control magic.
00:08:11.120,00:08:13.800,And if you cannot control magic...
00:08:17.640,00:08:19.440,magic will control you.
00:08:27.040,00:08:28.440,Lizard's tail.
00:08:29.640,00:08:30.840,Feather of crow.
00:08:34.039,00:08:36.480,Take my hair and make it grow.
00:08:48.720,00:08:52.160,"Still, you shouldn't be in trouble for something that Ethel did."
00:08:52.240,00:08:54.280,I wonder what the punishment's going to be.
00:09:24.280,00:09:26.000,I swear I didn't do anything!
00:09:28.760,00:09:32.200,"No need to panic, girls, they're quite harmless."
00:09:34.240,00:09:35.520,Class dismissed.
00:09:46.400,00:09:47.320,Yes!
00:09:47.400,00:09:51.120,The first year coven wants you. What's a coven?
00:09:54.480,00:09:58.560,"I am everywhere and nowhere, many and few."
00:09:58.640,00:10:01.520,"Find my door, high or low, it's really up to you."
00:10:01.600,00:10:03.160,Sounds tricky.
00:10:03.240,00:10:05.120,"Yeah, but what is it?"
00:10:05.200,00:10:07.640,-My mum was in the Flaming Broomsticks. -So was mine!
00:10:07.720,00:10:09.000,Is it a flying club?
00:10:09.080,00:10:12.480,"More like a secret society, a witching tradition."
00:10:13.440,00:10:15.720,The Flaming Broomsticks launched the space shuttle.
00:10:17.680,00:10:18.960,Your mums did all that?
00:10:19.040,00:10:22.240,Not them personally. It goes back generations.
00:10:23.200,00:10:24.280,Of course.
00:10:30.560,00:10:34.360,We have to solve the riddle to find the meeting point.
00:10:34.440,00:10:36.440,It's like an initiation before you can join.
00:10:39.720,00:10:41.160,So not everyone gets in.
00:10:42.240,00:10:44.760,"-It'll be fun, don't worry. -You'll love it, I promise."
00:10:57.280,00:10:59.680,"No, it hasn't worked, Tabby."
00:11:27.160,00:11:28.800,I know you want to tell me.
00:11:28.880,00:11:32.240,"Yes, you do. Come on."
00:11:32.640,00:11:34.080,Tell me where it is.
00:11:37.160,00:11:39.680,"Oh, well... I'll catch you later."
00:11:50.520,00:11:52.240,Any luck cracking the riddle?
00:11:52.720,00:11:53.560,Nope.
00:11:54.880,00:11:58.280,Us neither. We'd better start searching!
00:11:58.360,00:12:01.000,Reckon I'll sit this one out.
00:12:01.760,00:12:04.920,"I know it's your tradition or whatever, but it's not really mine."
00:12:05.000,00:12:08.000,-Of course it is! -It's not.
00:12:08.960,00:12:11.240,I'll always be the odd one out.
00:12:12.920,00:12:15.960,"But it's OK, I'm getting used to it."
00:12:17.000,00:12:19.160,I really hope you both get in.
00:12:55.840,00:13:00.640,All lessons are postponed till after the first coven meeting.
00:13:02.000,00:13:05.000,You should get your skates on. They'll start without you.
00:13:07.760,00:13:09.880,"I'd rather stay here, if it's all the same."
00:13:09.960,00:13:12.600,Oh. You're most welcome.
00:13:13.920,00:13:16.600,"Won't be much of a lesson, though, with just the one of you."
00:13:16.680,00:13:20.280,-Should I go back to my hutch then? -Any homework you could do?
00:13:23.320,00:13:28.880,"Well, it's not exactly work, but I've been looking for Hubble ancestors."
00:13:28.960,00:13:30.120,I could fetch my book.
00:13:30.680,00:13:33.040,If you insist on doing it the long way.
00:13:33.640,00:13:34.600,What's the short way?
00:13:36.240,00:13:38.120,We magic them up and have a chat over tea?
00:13:38.200,00:13:40.440,Good idea. I'm parched.
00:13:41.320,00:13:42.960,What were you going to suggest?
00:13:43.040,00:13:48.520,"Consulting Cackle's records, I think I might have been at school with a Hubble."
00:13:48.600,00:13:51.880,Really? What was she called?
00:13:52.320,00:13:53.640,Was she definitely a witch?
00:13:53.720,00:13:58.200,Or perhaps that was a Tubble... or a Bubble.
00:13:58.680,00:14:01.680,Oh! My memory's not what it was.
00:14:01.760,00:14:03.200,But there's a way of checking?
00:14:15.760,00:14:18.400,Why are the school records kept in a dungeon?
00:14:19.680,00:14:23.080,"Technically, it was only a dungeon for a century or two."
00:14:23.160,00:14:24.920,It's storage now...
00:14:25.360,00:14:28.640,unless you rub Miss Hardbroom up the wrong way.
00:14:37.400,00:14:38.680,It's a bit small.
00:14:45.800,00:14:50.480,"All Hubbles, present and past, schools and academies, first to last."
00:14:53.400,00:14:55.320,"Go on then, it won't bite."
00:15:14.720,00:15:16.080,Just me.
00:15:16.560,00:15:17.800,Mildred Hubble.
00:15:18.280,00:15:20.760,"Well, not every witch attends an academy."
00:15:21.640,00:15:25.440,"-How far do these records go back? -Oh, not that far."
00:15:25.880,00:15:27.560,Only the odd millennia.
00:15:28.120,00:15:30.840,"So if I was from a witching family, we would have found them."
00:15:32.960,00:15:37.120,"Why don't we get you back upstairs, start sniffing out this coven?"
00:15:37.200,00:15:39.600,I can't try to join it now. This is proof I don't belong.
00:15:39.680,00:15:43.600,It doesn't matter how many stuffy old witches you've got in your family.
00:15:43.680,00:15:53.880,A coven is about coming together in the here and now and doing incredible things with others that would be impossible on your own.
00:15:53.960,00:15:56.080,Like ice cream and moon landings.
00:15:56.160,00:16:00.480,Exactly. Although putting the two together isn't advisable.
00:16:00.560,00:16:01.480,You went into space?
00:16:02.040,00:16:05.960,"One great leap for man, one mere skip for witch-kind."
00:16:06.600,00:16:07.640,How?
00:16:07.720,00:16:13.040,"Oh, a smidge of rocket fuel and a lot of chanting."
00:16:14.040,00:16:16.680,I'll never know enough to do something like that.
00:16:18.400,00:16:22.840,Forget about what you know for a minute. Think about what you feel.
00:16:22.920,00:16:26.000,"Can you feel your magic, Mildred?"
00:16:27.880,00:16:29.800,More and more each day.
00:16:31.080,00:16:34.800,"Then you belong, dear, and you always will."
00:16:34.880,00:16:36.280,"Thanks for helping, Miss Bat."
00:16:41.280,00:16:44.200,"There's a rather large colony below stairs, I'm afraid."
00:17:03.800,00:17:06.480,"Mill, what are you doing down here?"
00:17:06.880,00:17:08.720,Getting slobbered on by bats mostly.
00:17:09.200,00:17:10.240,You?
00:17:10.319,00:17:12.640,"The riddle says, search high and low."
00:17:13.599,00:17:15.920,And we thought low might mean the cellar.
00:17:18.160,00:17:19.360,I've already checked it out.
00:17:20.080,00:17:22.760,-No sign of any secret doors. -You've been looking?
00:17:22.839,00:17:25.760,"Might have had second thoughts. It's not too late, is it?"
00:17:25.839,00:17:27.040,Of course not.
00:17:27.119,00:17:29.480,Did Miss Bat help you with a re-growth spell?
00:17:29.560,00:17:32.400,-Why? -Your hair's coming back.
00:17:33.520,00:17:36.360,"Ah, it must have been a slow-acting potion."
00:17:36.440,00:17:37.880,Like us finding this coven.
00:17:37.960,00:17:39.320,Where to next?
00:17:39.400,00:17:42.000,"High, I suppose? Top of the school?"
00:17:53.440,00:17:55.600,Everywhere and nowhere.
00:17:56.360,00:17:57.880,Everywhere and nowhere.
00:17:57.960,00:18:00.640,"Oh, this is taking too long."
00:18:03.080,00:18:04.800,"Uh, Dru..."
00:18:05.640,00:18:09.040,"I feel funny, like my wart's trying to tell me something."
00:18:13.600,00:18:18.240,I can smell something: baking bread and boiled turnips.
00:18:18.800,00:18:20.720,It must be in the kitchen.
00:18:22.480,00:18:23.360,Why would you do that?
00:18:24.200,00:18:26.360,First witch there is founding member.
00:18:26.920,00:18:30.560,Founding member chooses magical missions and who goes on them.
00:18:30.640,00:18:35.120,It's a huge responsibility. We can't just let anyone do it.
00:18:35.800,00:18:38.200,But if you didn't get there first fairly...
00:18:38.960,00:18:41.200,Then you won't get picked for anything.
00:18:42.280,00:18:46.320,"If that doesn't bother you, then I'm more than happy to find it on my own."
00:18:50.040,00:18:53.000,"Look, Mildred, your hair, it's grown."
00:18:57.440,00:19:01.600,I have to say I was expecting a more uncompromising approach.
00:19:01.680,00:19:06.120,"Ethel's desperate to stand out, Mildred to blend in. Polar opposites."
00:19:06.200,00:19:08.480,"The sooner they make friends, the better."
00:19:08.560,00:19:11.440,Pushing them together will only cause more chaos.
00:19:12.200,00:19:16.040,What would life be without a little chaos now and then?
00:19:26.320,00:19:45.200,We're heading for the roof. We'll be out of your hair-- There must be something up with the potion.
00:19:45.280,00:19:48.240,-Was there an antidote spell in the book? -I can't remember.
00:19:48.320,00:19:49.880,Try a general one.
00:19:49.960,00:19:53.080,"Potion born of witch's plot, I bid you cease, I bid you stop!"
00:20:38.840,00:20:40.240,Keep her back.
00:20:40.320,00:20:43.000,"If her hair explodes again, we might never get out."
00:20:47.120,00:20:49.200,It's taking over the whole school.
00:20:58.400,00:21:02.120,It appears to be distinctly Hubble-colored.
00:21:07.000,00:21:09.280,And there's a few burnt bits.
00:21:10.440,00:21:13.880,I made a re-growth potion. It must have been too strong.
00:21:14.800,00:21:17.920,"Or someone messed with it, added something to send it out of control."
00:21:18.000,00:21:19.200,I did no such thing.
00:21:19.760,00:21:22.280,"Well, if we don't know what it is, we can't reverse it."
00:21:22.720,00:21:24.440,"I got slobbered on, that added something."
00:21:25.800,00:21:26.880,Bat drool.
00:21:26.960,00:21:29.680,"Bat drool's an amplifier, toad brain."
00:21:29.760,00:21:31.520,What's an amplifier?
00:21:31.600,00:21:32.920,It makes a spell more powerful.
00:21:33.600,00:21:34.520,It's alive.
00:21:34.600,00:21:40.160,"OK, does anyone know a good bat drool antidote before we get smushed into a giant hairball?"
00:21:40.240,00:21:41.320,We don't need one.
00:21:44.000,00:21:46.520,Any antidote spell should work as long as Ethel says it.
00:21:46.600,00:21:48.480,"She's got wart power, remember?"
00:21:54.400,00:21:57.000,I think that's quite enough chaos for one day.
00:21:57.080,00:21:58.320,Wait.
00:21:58.400,00:22:00.280,"We set them a test, didn't we?"
00:22:00.360,00:22:04.280,And this will be a far tougher challenge than the one we came up with.
00:22:04.920,00:22:06.960,Let's see if they can rise to it.
00:22:09.440,00:22:14.920,"Potion born of witch's plot, I bid you cease, I bid you stop!"
00:22:16.920,00:22:18.240,Why isn't it working?
00:22:21.400,00:22:23.720,Say it with your finger on the wart and really concentrate.
00:22:23.800,00:22:24.960,It won't make any difference!
00:22:25.040,00:22:26.240,"-Please, Ethel! -I can't!"
00:22:26.320,00:22:30.200,"-We can barely breathe! Try it again! -It won't work, it's not real."
00:22:37.200,00:22:39.320,I don't have wart power.
00:22:40.320,00:22:41.960,I don't have a wart.
00:22:42.720,00:22:44.160,I made it up.
00:22:48.320,00:22:52.720,"Just out of interest, how much longer are you prepared to wait?"
00:22:52.800,00:22:55.440,I might hang on till eyebrow height.
00:23:04.680,00:23:07.160,"My parents, they're obsessed with Esmie and Sybil."
00:23:08.560,00:23:11.200,I faked it so they'd notice me for once.
00:23:11.280,00:23:12.960,You didn't have to lie to us.
00:23:13.040,00:23:15.720,I didn't ask you to get so excited about it.
00:23:18.240,00:23:20.440,It's too strong. I can't do it on my own.
00:23:22.200,00:23:24.400,"Which is why I need you all to help. Hold hands, quick!"
00:23:27.520,00:23:30.240,"If it can launch witches into space, it can tame my hair."
00:23:30.800,00:23:33.320,"A chant to break the spell, that's how covens work, right?"
00:23:33.400,00:23:35.760,Everyone together. Which chant?
00:23:36.880,00:23:39.480,"Cauldron blister, cauldron shake..."
00:23:39.560,00:23:41.920,Break this spell and make it quake.
00:23:42.000,00:23:45.960,"Rising moon and setting sun, we aren't many, we are one."
00:23:50.000,00:23:54.160,"Rising moon and setting sun, we aren't many, we are one!"
00:23:57.760,00:23:58.760,You did it.
00:24:00.000,00:24:01.320,We did it.
00:24:05.280,00:24:06.120,Come in!
00:24:30.040,00:24:33.400,"Top thinking, Esmie. Your plan worked a treat."
00:24:33.480,00:24:35.360,The mutant hair was the plan?
00:24:35.440,00:24:39.480,The coven was the plan to encourage teamwork.
00:24:40.200,00:24:44.840,The hair was a Mildred-shaped spanner in the works.
00:24:44.920,00:24:51.560,"I am everywhere and nowhere, many and few."
00:24:52.240,00:24:55.480,"Find my door, high or low..."
00:24:56.000,00:24:57.520,it's really up to you.
00:24:57.600,00:24:59.120,Did we pass the test?
00:24:59.200,00:25:02.320,"Uh, only this group. The others will have to try again next time."
00:25:02.400,00:25:05.040,You cracked the code by working together.
00:25:05.640,00:25:08.200,The chant unlocked the coven door.
00:25:10.440,00:25:13.440,Very great things await such a brave bunch.
00:25:20.720,00:25:25.360,I'm glad to see you're missing something. We frown on fakery here.
00:25:25.840,00:25:28.200,"I'm awfully sorry, Miss Cackle."
00:25:28.280,00:25:29.960,I trust you've learned your lesson?
00:25:31.000,00:25:33.400,Warts are a thing of the past.
00:25:33.680,00:25:35.840,We're much more subtle these days.
00:25:36.880,00:25:39.560,"You'd do well to remember that, Ethel Hallow."
00:25:39.640,00:25:41.840,I'm so glad you changed your mind.
00:25:42.520,00:25:44.840,"I still swamped everyone with hair, though."
00:25:45.880,00:25:48.720,-Your hair solved the riddle. -Maybe.
00:25:49.640,00:25:52.000,-But it still doesn't make me a witch. -Mill!
00:25:52.080,00:25:54.520,Miss Bat helped me search for my ancestors.
00:25:55.520,00:25:56.840,There weren't any.
00:25:58.080,00:26:02.200,So? You're officially the first witch of your entire family.
00:26:02.560,00:26:04.000,That's amazing!
00:26:04.800,00:26:06.080,You think?
00:26:11.280,00:26:14.200,That makes you ten times witchier than a lot of us.
00:26:23.640,00:26:28.200,"So, without further ado, we will begin the ceremony."
00:26:29.920,00:26:33.000,"As members of your new coven, you'll be more than just classmates..."
00:26:33.600,00:26:34.960,you'll be sisters.
00:26:35.040,00:26:38.560,It doesn't matters who's the best or the worst.
00:26:39.200,00:26:45.520,All that matters is joining together with your fellow witches and being stronger and better together.
00:26:46.560,00:26:48.640,Mildred Hubble.
00:26:50.920,00:26:56.680,"I'm really, really sorry about the hair. It was the bat drool and-- Toss your invitation into the cauldron."
00:26:58.680,00:27:00.200,But I'm not in trouble?
00:27:02.520,00:27:05.600,You're being sworn in as founder member.
00:27:08.000,00:27:10.480,You were the first witch to reveal the door.
00:27:11.280,00:27:14.640,That also means you get to choose a name.
00:27:17.560,00:27:19.760,How about the Hair Raisers?
00:27:23.720,00:27:27.240,The first and founding member of the Hair Raisers.
00:27:27.800,00:27:29.800,Mildred Hubble!
00:00:54.000,00:00:58.560,Maud Spellbody. Mildred Hubble.
00:01:00.120,00:01:04.760,How fortunate that tonight is parents' evening.
00:01:06.080,00:01:11.480,I shall be speaking to all of your parents... personally.
00:01:14.080,00:01:16.160,"Well, at least she didn't make us clean this up."
00:01:23.360,00:01:26.480,I'll just have to ask my dad to make a bigger donation than usual now.
00:01:26.560,00:01:28.160,It won't make any difference.
00:01:28.240,00:01:30.720,My mum's already expecting it to be terrible.
00:01:30.800,00:01:34.080,"Well, my parents aren't, and they're not rich either."
00:01:34.160,00:01:36.400,They can't just buy their way out of a bad report.
00:01:41.920,00:01:45.800,"You're year head, and you're giving the closing address later."
00:01:46.120,00:01:49.000,They won't be upset over one little mistake.
00:01:49.080,00:01:51.760,One? What about the time I failed my flying test?
00:01:51.840,00:01:53.400,"But that was my fault, really."
00:01:53.480,00:01:56.720,-The time I got you turned into a frog? -I got me turned into a frog.
00:01:56.800,00:01:58.520,Now I've blown up the potions lab.
00:01:58.600,00:02:01.080,I mixed up my will of bat with my eye of newt.
00:02:01.160,00:02:03.560,Every teacher's gonna have it in for me tonight.
00:02:04.880,00:02:08.720,"Even if they do, so what? Your parents will get over it."
00:02:11.320,00:02:12.840,-Hello! -Hello!
00:02:13.560,00:02:15.640,You've got the mirror the wrong way round.
00:02:15.720,00:02:18.080,-I told you. -You told me that way!
00:02:18.680,00:02:20.520,"No, the other way! There."
00:02:21.080,00:02:23.280,"Honestly, Maud, he's hopeless with magic."
00:02:23.360,00:02:26.720,"I can't be brilliant at everything, can I? Unlike my daughter."
00:02:30.400,00:02:32.560,Your mother can't wait to see Cackle's again!
00:02:32.640,00:02:35.640,It's the first time she's been there since she was a pupil.
00:02:38.880,00:02:43.000,I've cleared a space for your Year One witching certificate!
00:02:44.200,00:02:51.800,"Yeah, about that, Mum-- -Bye! -Bye!"
00:02:51.880,00:02:52.920,Love you.
00:02:53.480,00:02:55.760,-Love you. Sending you a cake. -Bye.
00:03:02.120,00:03:03.320,I feel bad for Maud.
00:03:04.480,00:03:07.400,She'd never have been in trouble if she hadn't made friends with me.
00:03:08.640,00:03:11.440,"She'd never have had any good times, either."
00:03:11.520,00:03:13.480,I should go and watch the door.
00:03:13.560,00:03:16.400,My mum will be the only one not arriving by broomstick.
00:03:16.840,00:03:18.800,She's walking up the mountain?
00:03:18.880,00:03:22.040,Don't you think she's trying a little too hard not to be a witch?
00:03:22.680,00:03:30.080,"OK, I know I said she might have had some secret witchy past, but it doesn't make sense. I'd know."
00:03:30.880,00:03:33.800,"Witches are very good at hiding their magic, Millie."
00:03:34.960,00:03:37.800,My mum's not even good at hiding my birthday presents.
00:03:37.880,00:03:41.640,"Top of the wardrobe, every single year. Better go and see if she's here."
00:03:51.760,00:03:53.480,I can't do it to them.
00:03:53.560,00:03:57.000,I can't let my parents find out what a boil and bubble I've made of everything.
00:03:57.760,00:04:04.680,"Well, you'll have to, unless you're going to use some serious pirated magic to fix everything..."
00:04:05.560,00:04:06.960,"and that's not very you, is it?"
00:04:10.680,00:04:13.040,You don't approve of pirated magic.
00:04:15.040,00:04:17.080,But if I did...
00:04:25.600,00:04:29.920,"When it works, it can get you out of very sticky situations."
00:04:30.000,00:04:33.520,I was glad I had it when you caught me copying out all of your homework.
00:04:34.960,00:04:37.720,-I don't remember that. -Exactly.
00:04:42.120,00:04:45.240,Forgetting powder is very unpredictable.
00:04:46.040,00:04:48.000,Are you sure you want to do this?
00:05:01.440,00:05:03.400,She's here. My mother's here!
00:05:04.280,00:05:05.760,You sound surprised.
00:05:06.920,00:05:09.640,I'm not surprised. I never had any doubt.
00:05:09.720,00:05:13.720,Are you saying my mother's only interested in Esmeralda's education?
00:05:15.080,00:05:16.360,No?
00:05:16.960,00:05:18.560,-No. -Good.
00:05:21.200,00:05:23.560,"-Well met, Mother. -Well met, Ethel."
00:05:23.640,00:05:25.240,How delightful to be here.
00:05:28.240,00:05:30.520,"I'll pass, thank you."
00:05:30.600,00:05:34.680,"Got to fit into the ceremonial robes for Esmie's prize-giving, after all."
00:05:35.880,00:05:37.680,"Shall we go, darling?"
00:05:48.000,00:05:49.280,Miss Drill?
00:05:50.080,00:05:51.880,"You haven't seen my mum, have you?"
00:05:52.760,00:05:55.960,"Oh, yes, she's over there speaking to..."
00:05:57.360,00:05:59.160,to Mr. Nightshade.
00:06:03.360,00:06:05.640,They are the next big witch holiday destination.
00:06:10.960,00:06:14.640,"Caves are so expensive during the school holidays, though."
00:06:14.720,00:06:17.080,We may have to stay at home this year.
00:06:17.160,00:06:18.520,"What about you, Julie?"
00:06:20.320,00:06:25.040,"Um, well, I'm thinking of investing in a mobile cave."
00:06:25.120,00:06:31.120,"I mean, your familiars can come with you, so you don't have to pay for a magic-friendly cattery or anything, which is a bonus."
00:06:31.200,00:06:33.360,-Mum? -Ooh. Mildred.
00:06:33.440,00:06:35.440,Didn't see you there. All right?
00:06:39.160,00:06:42.560,"But don't worry, I'm pumped to defend you of whatever you've done wrong this time."
00:06:42.640,00:06:44.760,We have to see Miss Hardbroom.
00:06:44.840,00:06:47.040,I feel an expensive night's coming on.
00:06:50.240,00:06:53.880,"Right, who have we got first? This way, is it?"
00:06:58.360,00:07:00.320,What is keeping Maud?
00:07:06.000,00:07:09.480,Ah-ha! Flying certificate.
00:07:11.920,00:07:13.720,Frog transformation homework.
00:07:13.800,00:07:15.800,"What else do I need to add, Midnight?"
00:07:16.400,00:07:17.320,Um...
00:07:22.680,00:07:26.520,"Oh, let's just say... everything I've done since I've got here."
00:07:30.440,00:07:32.560,Each daft thing I said in class.
00:07:33.640,00:07:36.280,Every test I didn't come top of.
00:08:10.800,00:08:16.200,"From HB. See me. It hasn't worked, Midnight."
00:08:18.880,00:08:22.640,"-Hey! -Hi, Mum, Dad."
00:08:28.680,00:08:30.720,"I mean, obviously it's changed a lot since then."
00:08:30.800,00:08:33.120,It's... it's so modern now.
00:08:33.200,00:08:38.440,"Oh! If I'd had the opportunities that young witches have today, I might have got a lot farther."
00:08:39.120,00:08:41.880,Can you tell how much your mother's been looking forward to this?
00:08:50.640,00:08:53.680,No biggie. All we have to do is buy new potion lab equipment.
00:08:53.760,00:08:56.920,"Miss Hardbroom thinks she's a big deal, but she doesn't scare me."
00:09:00.920,00:09:03.040,The Spellbodys.
00:09:03.120,00:09:04.600,Enter.
00:09:09.800,00:09:12.520,"What's the spell for ground opening up below you, again?"
00:09:13.560,00:09:14.920,"Oh, you'll be all right."
00:09:17.280,00:09:20.280,-The forgetting powder didn't work. -What forgetting powder?
00:09:26.920,00:09:32.240,"It was necessary to see you this evening, not only as your daughter's potions teacher..."
00:09:33.000,00:09:36.200,but as deputy head.
00:09:36.280,00:09:38.520,This is because...
00:09:40.520,00:09:43.960,"Strange, I... I..."
00:09:44.040,00:09:47.960,can't remember why it was necessary.
00:09:48.040,00:09:50.720,I can't think of a time when she's been on the losing side.
00:09:50.800,00:09:53.640,She really is an exemplary sports witch.
00:09:54.880,00:10:00.280,"But right now, I can't recall."
00:10:00.360,00:10:06.480,Not one occasion did I have to correct her chanting or remark on her tempo.
00:10:06.560,00:10:09.920,She has been note-perfect all term.
00:10:10.000,00:10:13.720,A flawless understanding of animal physiognomy.
00:10:14.520,00:10:17.920,I only wish the other girls were more like Maud.
00:10:19.400,00:10:23.600,So... Maud must be doing very well.
00:10:24.800,00:10:26.320,Very well indeed?
00:10:31.120,00:10:35.600,"So if we survive HB, we have spell science next..."
00:10:36.280,00:10:41.480,"then flying, then advanced chanting."
00:10:41.560,00:10:43.600,I thought advanced chanting was Year Two.
00:10:44.160,00:10:46.840,It is. But how would you know that?
00:10:48.560,00:10:52.760,Millie! Excuse us one moment.
00:10:54.040,00:10:55.120,It's like a dream.
00:10:55.200,00:10:59.560,"The teachers didn't even mention the flying test, the frog..."
00:11:00.120,00:11:02.160,not even the explosion.
00:11:02.720,00:11:04.720,"Sorry, what are you talking about?"
00:11:06.040,00:11:11.160,I got hold of some forgetting powder to make everyone forget my mistakes.
00:11:11.240,00:11:13.960,Please don't get mad. It worked.
00:11:14.040,00:11:16.440,"It really, really worked."
00:11:16.520,00:11:19.680,"OK, but I don't know why you're telling me this."
00:11:19.760,00:11:21.960,I can't remember you ever speaking to me before.
00:11:22.560,00:11:23.520,You can't remember?
00:11:24.280,00:11:27.480,I'm pleased you're having a good parents' evening.
00:11:50.640,00:11:51.960,She's forgotten me.
00:11:53.360,00:11:54.640,Of course she has.
00:11:54.720,00:11:58.120,What does everyone think my biggest mistake at Cackle's is?
00:12:00.120,00:12:02.560,Making friends with Mildred Hubble.
00:12:07.040,00:12:12.120,Week four: transformed fellow pupil into pig.
00:12:12.200,00:12:17.720,Week five: embarrassed entire school in front of the Great Wizard...
00:12:18.480,00:12:21.200,in several ways.
00:12:21.280,00:12:24.120,-Week six-- -I'm sorry.
00:12:24.200,00:12:27.440,"This is all very well, but I don't really see that it's relevant."
00:12:27.520,00:12:36.160,"Miss Hubble, as an... ordinary person, I realize you are not acquainted with the Witches' Code."
00:12:36.240,00:12:40.160,"-However-- -Oh, section two, sub-section C, perhaps."
00:12:40.240,00:12:44.600,The bit about senior witches having a duty of care for junior witches.
00:12:44.680,00:12:47.000,It doesn't sound as though that's what's happened here.
00:12:47.080,00:12:52.040,We are talking about a complete lack of magical control.
00:12:52.120,00:13:02.320,"You see, the way I read it, the code is mainly about not deliberately harming others, using magic for personal gain or publicly exposing other witches."
00:13:02.400,00:13:06.200,So which rule has Mildred actually broken?
00:13:08.040,00:13:12.760,"Right, well, if there's nothing else, I think we have other appointments to get to."
00:13:12.840,00:13:15.400,"Mum, since when did you know about the Witches' Code?"
00:13:15.480,00:13:19.200,Sorry. I like to be invisible on parents' evening...
00:13:19.760,00:13:21.960,"keep a discreet eye on things, you know."
00:13:22.880,00:13:24.080,I'll take it from here.
00:13:28.320,00:13:31.720,I realize Miss Hardbroom can be a little brusque.
00:13:31.800,00:13:32.880,You could say that.
00:13:32.960,00:13:36.520,"However, I'm forced to admit that she may have a point."
00:13:37.440,00:13:38.600,Sorry?
00:13:39.840,00:13:48.480,"I have been in two minds about this, but blowing up the potion lab today was the final straw."
00:13:48.560,00:13:52.960,I also feel that Mildred Hubble has not really found her feet.
00:13:54.720,00:13:56.800,"Perhaps, if she had a friend to guide her..."
00:13:58.200,00:14:06.440,"...the right kind of friend, a steadying influence, things might be different, but she hasn't connected with anyone like that."
00:14:06.520,00:14:11.080,I'm afraid everything she's touched has turned to disaster.
00:14:11.840,00:14:14.480,"-Now, I've been through this once. -No, Mum."
00:14:16.240,00:14:17.480,She's right.
00:14:20.000,00:14:22.080,I don't belong here.
00:14:25.480,00:14:26.480,"Sorry, Dad."
00:14:26.560,00:14:28.600,Second-worst witch. Wait till I tell your mother.
00:14:28.680,00:14:32.960,Enid! It's terrible! Mildred's forgotten that we're friends.
00:14:33.840,00:14:35.720,You're telling me this why?
00:14:35.800,00:14:37.680,"Don't say you've forgotten, too."
00:14:37.760,00:14:40.200,"This is a little bit weird, so..."
00:14:40.920,00:14:46.200,You gave me some pirated forgetting powder so that I'd have a perfect parents' evening.
00:14:46.280,00:14:47.920,Sounds like something I'd do.
00:14:48.840,00:14:50.200,Look.
00:14:55.480,00:14:57.240,How do I reverse the magic?
00:14:58.000,00:14:59.320,I don't know.
00:15:00.520,00:15:04.720,I'm not losing my best friend. You're going to help.
00:15:05.880,00:15:10.400,I'll get you a magic tutor. We'll apply to a different academy.
00:15:10.480,00:15:14.440,-Why didn't you tell me you were a witch? -What makes you think I'm a witch?
00:15:14.520,00:15:18.960,"I heard you with the other parents, and only witches know the Witches' Code."
00:15:19.040,00:15:21.080,"All this time, you've been hiding it from me. Why?"
00:15:21.160,00:15:22.400,Mildred.
00:15:23.320,00:15:27.800,"If I'd had the same start in life as the rest of the girls, maybe I wouldn't be leaving."
00:15:34.080,00:15:36.320,I don't have time for this nonsense right now.
00:15:36.400,00:15:39.000,I need to have one last look around before I go forever.
00:15:42.160,00:15:48.120,"Miss Cackle said it herself, I don't fit in, and I don't have a role model, and she's right."
00:15:48.200,00:15:50.360,What does she mean? You have me.
00:15:56.600,00:15:58.520,How can it be? I hardly know you.
00:15:59.080,00:16:02.160,But you do. We're best friends.
00:16:04.440,00:16:05.800,best friends with the worst witch?
00:16:10.280,00:16:13.120,I may have given her a forgetting powder.
00:16:13.200,00:16:16.840,"The explosion at lunchtime, we were all there."
00:16:19.400,00:16:22.720,OK. How did you get to Cackle's in the first place?
00:16:22.800,00:16:23.880,"Well, I..."
00:16:29.360,00:16:32.520,I crash-landed onto your balcony. How can you not even remember that?
00:16:32.600,00:16:36.400,What does it matter how I arrived anyway? I'm not a pupil here anymore.
00:16:45.280,00:16:47.080,There's only one thing for it.
00:16:48.040,00:16:51.120,-I've got to tell the truth. -That'll get you thrown out.
00:16:51.200,00:16:54.320,I don't care what happens to me if it saves Mildred.
00:16:54.400,00:16:56.200,It will also get me thrown out.
00:16:56.280,00:17:00.720,I'd be banned from every witching academy in the land.
00:17:01.480,00:17:03.560,Every witching academy?
00:17:03.880,00:17:06.960,You didn't tell me it was that big of an offense.
00:17:08.200,00:17:10.079,There's got to be some other way.
00:17:14.240,00:17:19.319,"Yes, Ethel continues to perform impressively in every subject."
00:17:19.720,00:17:22.840,"What about extracurricular activities, Miss Cackle?"
00:17:22.920,00:17:24.560,You must tell Mother about those.
00:17:25.880,00:17:34.640,"Ethel takes part in many out-of-hours activities: invisible netball, instrument-less orchestra, hat-making club."
00:17:34.720,00:17:37.680,"In fact, she's the only member of that one."
00:17:38.600,00:17:40.560,"Get back to your room, Sybil."
00:17:45.200,00:17:46.040,That...
00:17:46.120,00:17:47.960,That is wonderful news.
00:17:48.040,00:17:54.200,"Mother, why are you talking to my little sister, my little sister who's at home?"
00:17:54.280,00:17:56.280,"Don't fret about it, darling."
00:17:56.360,00:17:59.680,"Now, who are we seeing next? Miss Bat, is it?"
00:18:00.200,00:18:01.680,"You're not here, are you, Mother?"
00:18:01.760,00:18:05.760,"Of course I'm here. We're looking at each other, aren't we?"
00:18:08.960,00:18:12.400,"OK, no, I'm not here."
00:18:12.480,00:18:15.920,"A projection spell, Mother! How could you?"
00:18:16.000,00:18:18.000,You couldn't even be bothered making the trip.
00:18:18.080,00:18:20.840,"Oh, come now, darling. I will be here next month."
00:18:20.920,00:18:23.400,"For Esmeralda's prize-giving, we know that."
00:18:23.480,00:18:26.240,You wouldn't miss Esmeralda's night for the world.
00:18:26.320,00:18:29.640,"-Maud Spellbody, do you mind? -What do you want, Miss Perfect?"
00:18:29.720,00:18:32.520,I suppose your mother's super proud of you.
00:18:37.080,00:18:39.520,What is the meaning of bursting in?
00:18:39.600,00:18:42.280,"Miss Cackle, I heard that Mildred Hubble's leaving."
00:18:42.880,00:18:44.880,"Sadly, she has chosen that path."
00:18:44.960,00:18:47.040,I'd like to volunteer to help her.
00:18:47.720,00:18:50.040,"You, help Mildred Hubble?"
00:18:50.120,00:18:53.560,To keep her on the straight and narrow. I'm just what she needs.
00:18:54.160,00:18:58.400,"Well, thank you for that kind offer. It's no less than I'd expect from you."
00:18:58.480,00:19:02.640,"However, I can't remember ever seeing the two of you together."
00:19:03.240,00:19:04.880,I can't imagine how you'd get on.
00:19:04.960,00:19:07.560,"Well, we'd make great friends, honestly!"
00:19:08.360,00:19:15.840,"We wouldn't want to mar your impressive academic record with Mildred Hubble's penchant for disaster, would we?"
00:19:19.080,00:19:21.120,Mildred Hubble has quit?
00:19:21.200,00:19:23.280,-It didn't work. -Mildred's still leaving?
00:19:23.360,00:19:25.120,It's obvious what you do.
00:19:25.480,00:19:28.640,The same thing I did when I had forgetting-powder accidents at school.
00:19:28.720,00:19:29.720,Dad!
00:19:52.480,00:19:57.120,Mmm! That's what I love about this school. The snacks!
00:20:01.000,00:20:03.360,"Quick, like your dad said, first-aid cupboard."
00:20:17.400,00:20:18.920,"Go, go, go!"
00:20:26.080,00:20:28.280,Just enough for one go.
00:20:31.800,00:20:36.960,"To this powder, all will surrender-- -Can you make my mum remember? -Millie, no!"
00:20:37.040,00:20:39.840,Mildred! I've looked everywhere for ya.
00:20:45.360,00:20:49.640,Oh. I remember where the car keys are. I remember the code for the alarm.
00:20:52.600,00:20:55.600,-The car boot's gonna stink a bit. -But what about being a witch?
00:20:56.200,00:20:59.640,"Oh, I've told you, Mildred, I'm not a witch."
00:20:59.720,00:21:01.880,"But the chat with the other parents, the Witches' Code."
00:21:01.960,00:21:03.040,Yeah.
00:21:03.840,00:21:08.160,"As for the small talk, well, I just wanted to fit in with the other parents."
00:21:08.720,00:21:16.320,"And the code... Well, this school might be different in lots of ways, but it's the same as all the others with all the stuff it sends to parents."
00:21:17.040,00:21:23.360,"Diary dates, school uniform list, dinner menus and the Witches' Code."
00:21:24.400,00:21:28.520,"You're always telling me to be proud of who I am, not to pretend to be someone that I'm not."
00:21:28.600,00:21:32.320,"Yes, I know. I'm sorry."
00:21:32.960,00:21:36.880,I just didn't want to embarrass you. I didn't want to be the worst mum.
00:21:44.920,00:21:51.480,"You realize that this girl is responsible for your daughter leaving the school, all because she didn't want to disappoint her parents."
00:21:53.520,00:21:58.120,I have to admit to what I've done... whatever the consequences.
00:21:58.200,00:21:59.880,That won't make people remember.
00:22:00.240,00:22:02.920,"They'll know you used forgetting power, but the memories won't come back."
00:22:03.520,00:22:05.480,Then how do I get them to remember?
00:22:07.400,00:22:10.600,"Don't worry, Maud, we all make mistakes."
00:22:12.000,00:22:14.480,No one's made a mistake as big as this.
00:22:14.960,00:22:17.400,"Hey, I've made plenty bigger."
00:22:20.640,00:22:21.640,That's it!
00:22:24.520,00:22:27.560,"The mistakes you've made, Maud, they're just not big enough."
00:22:27.640,00:22:28.720,They're not?
00:22:29.280,00:22:34.640,"Surely if you were to do something truly disastrous, then no one will be able to forget it."
00:22:34.720,00:22:37.520,Even with forgetting powder. It would break the spell.
00:22:37.600,00:22:42.960,But how am I going to make a huge mistake that everyone knows about before the end of the day?
00:22:46.560,00:22:53.760,"Whether it's been good or bad, I'm sure we will all be working to improve our performance next term."
00:22:53.840,00:22:56.040,"Maud, where did you go?"
00:22:56.120,00:23:00.000,"I'm really sorry for what's about to happen, Mum, Dad."
00:23:00.080,00:23:28.040,"All that's left now is for me to hand over to our wonderful year head, Um, to start, I'd like to..."
00:23:29.760,00:23:31.640,thank a few people.
00:23:35.040,00:23:39.120,But I can't do that because I do not deserve to be up here.
00:23:40.440,00:23:41.800,I messed up.
00:23:41.880,00:23:46.200,I used forgetting powder on all of you to make sure I got good reports tonight.
00:23:46.280,00:23:48.800,Yes! Year head is mine.
00:23:48.880,00:23:53.120,And I did get them... but I lost a friend.
00:23:54.280,00:23:57.160,"And now, I need you to remember."
00:23:57.840,00:24:07.400,I need all of you to remember that Mildred Hubble and I are friends and that is not a mistake.
00:24:08.240,00:24:12.320,"This, on the other hand, is a mistake."
00:24:12.400,00:24:13.320,What's she doing?
00:24:13.400,00:24:17.520,"-A very, very big... -Oh, no!"
00:24:21.480,00:24:22.320,"Oh, no!"
00:24:22.400,00:24:25.720,Tell me that's not the potion we mixed at lunchtime.
00:24:25.800,00:24:28.600,It's the potion we mixed at lunchtime.
00:24:39.280,00:24:41.160,Did it... did it lift the spell?
00:24:49.520,00:24:55.880,"And Mildred Hubble and Enid Nightshade, always in it together."
00:24:55.960,00:24:57.000,You remember!
00:25:00.720,00:25:08.400,"Failed flying tests, accidental frog transformations, -blown-up potions labs, and now-- -Could I check?"
00:25:08.480,00:25:11.280,"My daughter is the second-worst witch again, isn't she?"
00:25:11.360,00:25:13.000,She won't be a witch at all!
00:25:13.080,00:25:16.960,"After today's outrage, they should all be thrown out."
00:25:17.280,00:25:19.680,I find it hard to disagree.
00:25:21.080,00:25:25.040,"Your money won't help this time, Mr. Nightshade."
00:25:26.840,00:25:29.800,"Did you not hear me, Mr. Spellbody?"
00:25:29.880,00:25:30.840,Ah...
00:25:31.720,00:25:38.760,"The thing is, Miss Hardbroom, I don't have that much spare cash, so I wasn't actually offering."
00:25:40.560,00:25:46.920,"Though this may not all delight, you lot, forget about tonight."
00:25:59.040,00:26:01.920,Why are you all still here?
00:26:02.000,00:26:04.800,Oh. Did I offer you tea?
00:26:09.920,00:26:13.920,I always carry some with me. You never know when you're going to need it.
00:26:14.000,00:26:16.480,"Dad, you fixed everything."
00:26:30.880,00:26:32.360,"Sorry, Mum."
00:26:32.760,00:26:36.200,"I would never hide anything from you. Well, maybe your birthday presents."
00:26:36.280,00:26:38.400,"You still don't know where they're kept, do you?"
00:26:39.680,00:26:44.560,"Mum, if my magic doesn't come from you, where does it come from?"
00:26:45.880,00:26:49.320,"Well, I'm sure you'll work that out for yourself someday."
00:26:50.000,00:26:54.720,"Till then, you've just got to believe that you are good enough to be here."
00:26:55.000,00:26:56.440,"And so do you, Mum."
00:26:57.120,00:26:58.200,The best mum.
00:26:59.640,00:27:04.040,I know you've seen a different side of me this evening.
00:27:08.720,00:27:12.120,And we are more proud of you than ever.
00:27:12.200,00:27:15.400,Standing up in front of everyone to admit what you'd done?
00:27:15.800,00:27:18.520,"That takes real guts, Maud."
00:27:19.280,00:27:22.080,But aren't you massively disappointed in me?
00:27:22.160,00:27:25.200,What about all the stupid mistakes I've made since I've come here?
00:27:25.280,00:27:28.960,"Maud, why do you think I carry that powder?"
00:27:32.080,00:27:36.240,Mistakes are how you learn. Mistakes are a sign that you tried.
00:27:36.320,00:27:41.640,And you never stop trying. That's what makes you you.
00:27:43.520,00:27:47.280,"Hey, you know what this calls for, don't you?"
00:27:47.360,00:27:49.920,-A family shot for the wall! -Shot for the wall!
00:00:06.000,00:00:08.680,It's your birth scroll. There's something you need to know.
00:00:08.760,00:00:11.880,This knowledge could endanger the entire school.
00:00:11.960,00:00:16.520,"Somehow, Agatha managed to escape the enchantments that bound her to Darkwood Cottage."
00:00:17.040,00:00:18.920,They lied to her all her life.
00:00:19.800,00:00:24.160,"-Esmerelda, what have you done? -I think you might want to see this."
00:01:29.800,00:01:31.760,"Please pick up, Millie."
00:01:32.240,00:01:33.600,Please.
00:01:34.960,00:01:36.480,Please?
00:01:44.280,00:01:46.120,Why don't you just talk to her?
00:01:46.520,00:01:47.840,She got me expelled.
00:01:47.920,00:01:49.800,"Well, perhaps she wants to say sorry."
00:01:51.840,00:01:53.200,It's a bit late for that.
00:02:05.320,00:02:06.160,Flappy!
00:02:16.760,00:02:19.280,Oh! Detector spell?
00:02:19.360,00:02:23.520,"Yes, it will alert us to any unauthorized magic."
00:02:24.760,00:02:29.720,The spell has been applied to everyone on the premises.
00:02:30.640,00:02:36.080,"It's an important health and safety measure, isn't it, Flappy?"
00:02:39.320,00:02:41.560,what about Miss Drill?
00:02:41.640,00:02:44.640,"Oh, that was just one of my little jokes."
00:02:46.640,00:02:49.480,Dimity! Are you all right?
00:02:51.680,00:02:52.880,I think so.
00:02:59.120,00:03:00.840,But where's Miss Cackle?
00:03:00.920,00:03:02.960,When the truth came out...
00:03:03.560,00:03:09.080,she ran away rather than face the consequences of her crimes.
00:03:09.440,00:03:10.560,What truth?
00:03:11.520,00:03:15.560,"As the elder daughter, Agatha is the legitimate headmistress."
00:03:15.640,00:03:17.560,We must accept that.
00:03:17.640,00:03:22.800,"After all, only the Great Wizard can rewrite the Witches' Code."
00:03:22.880,00:03:25.800,"So he can, jammy old toad."
00:03:38.080,00:03:42.840,"So, I'd better get on with running my school."
00:03:43.520,00:03:47.760,This place will never be yours. A school isn't bricks and mortar.
00:03:47.840,00:03:51.720,"A school is its students, and the girls will never accept you."
00:03:53.200,00:03:57.280,"Oh, I'm sure they'll like me, once they get to know me."
00:04:01.200,00:04:09.000,"And so, in conclusion, today we hail a glorious new dawn for this academy. Wait for applause."
00:04:12.880,00:04:17.040,"Get some life into it, Gullett, you're about as inspiring as a dead frog."
00:04:20.040,00:04:25.680,Please give a warm Cackle's welcome for our new headmistress!
00:04:30.880,00:04:32.160,"Girls, girls, girls."
00:04:33.560,00:04:37.880,I am so sorry about everything that you've been through.
00:04:38.760,00:04:44.480,"How you have suffered under the regime of that impostor, my sister."
00:04:44.560,00:04:52.280,"Horrible food, constant tests, endless boring chanting lessons."
00:04:53.240,00:04:57.600,"Well, that's all going to change."
00:04:57.680,00:05:01.440,Check your maglets for your new timetables.
00:05:03.880,00:05:07.560,"As you'll see, I've added three extra break times per week."
00:05:13.600,00:05:17.080,I'll be issuing remembering powder to all of you.
00:05:18.800,00:05:21.680,But they'll forget everything as soon as the spell wears off.
00:05:22.280,00:05:26.040,Why do you care? You're not even a witch anymore.
00:05:28.120,00:05:30.160,Listen to your new...
00:05:31.880,00:05:33.720,head girl.
00:05:50.520,00:05:52.200,You've been practicing.
00:05:56.480,00:05:59.000,"Oh, sorry, Mrs. Roberts!"
00:05:59.080,00:06:00.440,You'll have to stop.
00:06:07.640,00:06:10.920,You've beaten the computer! I didn't even know you could do that!
00:06:11.000,00:06:12.080,Me neither.
00:06:14.520,00:06:19.160,"Was that, you know, M-A-G-I-C?"
00:06:20.360,00:06:21.520,I don't know.
00:06:24.120,00:06:28.680,"Tell us where she is, or I'll turn you into a dung beetle."
00:06:31.080,00:06:32.680,Or a head louse.
00:06:33.480,00:06:34.760,Or...
00:06:45.800,00:06:46.960,What was that?
00:06:47.040,00:06:50.560,"Naughty, naughty, you used unauthorized spells."
00:06:50.640,00:06:52.920,"Discovery and transference, to be precise."
00:06:53.000,00:06:54.440,"Sorry, force of habit."
00:06:54.520,00:06:56.200,I was looking for Maud.
00:06:56.680,00:06:59.400,They were going to turn me into a toilet brush!
00:06:59.760,00:07:02.000,I'm sure that won't be necessary.
00:07:02.080,00:07:05.720,Maud is a good girl who respects authority.
00:07:18.560,00:07:22.000,"You will set an example to the others, won't you?"
00:07:23.480,00:07:24.640,Yes.
00:07:29.640,00:07:31.520,"That's all right, dear. Run along now."
00:07:41.880,00:07:44.280,And you should return to your duties.
00:07:45.000,00:07:47.600,I didn't authorize a transference spell.
00:07:48.600,00:07:49.760,Indeed not.
00:08:03.040,00:08:05.920,"She can see, hear, think and feel."
00:08:19.880,00:08:23.200,So Miss Cackle didn't run away.
00:08:23.280,00:08:26.000,No. Agatha trapped her in the picture.
00:08:26.480,00:08:27.640,And it's all my fault.
00:08:27.720,00:08:30.200,-You didn't know. -But I let Agatha in.
00:08:30.280,00:08:32.280,I have to do something to save Miss Cackle.
00:08:34.039,00:08:36.400,"Miss Cackle summoned the Great Wizard, remember?"
00:08:37.000,00:08:38.920,"When he gets here, he'll sort everything out."
00:08:40.120,00:08:42.440,Yes. He will.
00:08:50.000,00:08:53.360,Miss Cackle's trapped in a painting. We are in big trouble.
00:08:53.960,00:08:56.360,You're right. What are we gonna do?
00:08:56.440,00:08:59.760,There's only one thing we can. Tell the truth and say sorry.
00:09:03.760,00:09:05.360,I summon Miss Gullett.
00:09:08.960,00:09:12.640,It's an emergency! The Great Wizard's on his way!
00:09:13.800,00:09:16.680,So you better let Miss Cackle go and put this school back to normal.
00:09:16.760,00:09:20.520,"Are you telling me what to do, mistress bossy drawers?"
00:09:21.080,00:09:23.720,I'm just saying you don't have a choice.
00:09:23.800,00:09:27.200,"Esmerelda Hallow, your sort make me sick!"
00:09:27.880,00:09:33.720,You're all jolly broomsticks and team spirit and shiny trophies!
00:09:38.000,00:09:39.040,Esme?
00:09:42.400,00:09:44.480,Better put it somewhere safe.
00:09:50.880,00:09:55.560,"If the Great Wizard tries to take my school, every atom of it will be destroyed."
00:09:56.720,00:10:00.880,"If I can't have this place, no one can."
00:10:03.880,00:10:05.840,You shouldn't have interfered.
00:10:06.360,00:10:10.680,"Agatha's the rightful headmistress, because she's the older sister."
00:10:14.520,00:10:15.760,All right.
00:10:19.800,00:10:20.720,You win.
00:10:21.840,00:10:22.720,I'm sorry.
00:10:31.520,00:10:32.520,How did you get here?
00:10:37.600,00:10:38.680,What's this?
00:10:42.840,00:10:43.920,From Ethel.
00:10:44.960,00:10:46.720,"Ooh, look, he's here!"
00:10:56.640,00:10:58.400,"Oh, hurry, my love."
00:11:05.160,00:11:07.920,"It's OK, the Great Wizard will sort everything out."
00:11:09.640,00:11:11.920,"Wait, Your Greatness, we must warn you!"
00:11:12.000,00:11:15.800,Agatha's taken over! She thinks she's headmistress now.
00:11:15.880,00:11:17.000,Headmistress?
00:11:17.080,00:11:21.520,"I think I can deal with one power-crazed middle-aged witch, thank you, Algernon."
00:11:24.200,00:11:28.400,A little bat told me you were telling tales.
00:11:29.640,00:11:31.280,Oh! Oh!
00:11:31.360,00:11:33.320,"Oh, don't worry, my dear."
00:11:41.560,00:11:42.440,Ha!
00:11:48.840,00:11:49.800,We've got you.
00:11:51.040,00:11:52.520,Agatha's taken over.
00:11:54.080,00:11:55.480,I need to go back and help.
00:12:08.080,00:12:11.000,"So you see, I am the elder daughter."
00:12:17.960,00:12:20.200,-The code! -I am the code.
00:12:20.280,00:12:22.520,"I can rewrite it, every line."
00:12:23.080,00:12:28.640,"Now, before I decide what your punishment will be, where is your sister?"
00:12:28.720,00:12:31.520,I was afraid you might ask me that.
00:12:36.440,00:12:41.600,"You have the second-hand powers of a teenage girl, and I am twice as strong as any mere witch."
00:12:43.440,00:12:45.200,But not as strong as three.
00:12:48.960,00:12:52.000,"Hecate Hardbroom, why?"
00:12:52.680,00:12:55.000,She was going to destroy the school.
00:12:56.000,00:12:59.160,I've got the perfect punishment for you.
00:13:11.760,00:13:14.360,I'll just pop you over there.
00:13:17.720,00:13:20.560,"Sorry, bad choice of words."
00:13:25.200,00:13:27.480,Do what? He's been here for hours and nothing's happened.
00:13:32.800,00:13:34.920,"Agatha's got him, too, hasn't she?"
00:13:41.120,00:13:45.560,You are invited to an end-of-term feast in the Great Hall.
00:13:45.640,00:13:49.600,We need to get that picture... and save Miss Cackle.
00:14:02.720,00:14:04.400,Let's hope Ethel's telling the truth.
00:14:31.320,00:14:33.920,"You need to be invited in, remember?"
00:14:36.360,00:14:38.880,"Never thought I'd say this, but..."
00:14:39.640,00:14:43.160,"well met and welcome, Mildred Hubble."
00:14:49.920,00:14:52.360,It's... gone.
00:14:56.560,00:14:58.360,No. I promise.
00:15:01.760,00:15:02.640,Is that you?
00:15:06.200,00:15:07.320,Where are you?
00:15:10.160,00:15:11.480,I can see that.
00:15:11.920,00:15:13.960,Well... I can't.
00:15:14.040,00:15:15.040,I mean...
00:15:15.120,00:15:17.080,"Oh, just come here, you silly slug."
00:15:23.520,00:15:26.600,I'm sorry I got you expelled.
00:15:27.160,00:15:29.120,I was just trying to keep you safe.
00:15:29.720,00:15:33.120,"More importantly, what are you two doing in here?"
00:15:34.080,00:15:36.160,"Well, we thought..."
00:15:39.560,00:15:43.200,that if we could get the painting out of the school...
00:15:43.640,00:15:45.400,then maybe someone...
00:15:49.560,00:15:51.640,It isn't what it looks like.
00:15:52.200,00:15:55.200,"Trying to steal school property, eh?"
00:15:55.280,00:15:57.680,We didn't... It wasn't me.
00:16:01.080,00:16:06.240,Because I think you've all seen a little bit too much.
00:16:09.840,00:16:11.640,Of course not.
00:16:12.400,00:16:16.360,I'd hate you to miss the end-of-term celebrations!
00:16:33.240,00:16:34.520,The spell's wearing off.
00:16:36.080,00:16:37.120,Mildred Hubble!
00:16:37.200,00:16:39.800,-I thought you were-- -I... I came back.
00:16:39.880,00:16:42.840,"Ethel, Maud and Enid, Miss Gullett turned them into cakes."
00:16:42.920,00:16:44.280,-Cakes? Stop that. -Yes.
00:16:46.560,00:16:48.000,Only Miss Cackle...
00:16:51.280,00:16:53.160,can help them now.
00:16:53.680,00:16:55.160,And unfortunately...
00:16:56.120,00:17:00.760,only you can help Miss Cackle.
00:17:14.560,00:17:16.840,"Enjoy, girls."
00:17:17.640,00:17:20.920,"More cakes? Miss Gullett, you are spoiling us."
00:17:22.000,00:17:24.440,They do look delicious.
00:17:25.960,00:17:31.080,"By all we see and all we are, I summon you from realms afar."
00:17:36.360,00:17:38.480,Did... did I say it wrong?
00:17:40.080,00:17:41.480,It's not your fault.
00:17:42.560,00:17:43.800,You're too young.
00:17:43.880,00:17:46.640,A witch's power increases every year.
00:17:46.720,00:17:48.360,I just hoped...
00:17:48.440,00:17:49.880,So what do we do now?
00:17:49.960,00:17:54.080,"You need to go home. Be safe, Mildred Hubble."
00:17:54.160,00:17:56.040,-But what are you-- -I said go.
00:18:00.000,00:18:00.880,Go.
00:18:10.880,00:18:12.000,Thank you.
00:18:14.800,00:18:15.880,Stop!
00:18:17.000,00:18:18.800,Mildred Hubble!
00:18:18.880,00:18:25.040,By all that I see and all that we are...
00:18:26.080,00:18:32.280,"I summon you, Ada, from realms afar."
00:18:40.840,00:18:42.640,We'll deal with you later.
00:18:49.600,00:18:50.760,No!
00:18:51.400,00:18:53.720,"Mildred, I was going to eat that."
00:18:53.800,00:18:55.040,"Well, don't."
00:18:56.120,00:18:57.560,Those aren't cakes.
00:18:58.720,00:18:59.720,They're your friends.
00:18:59.800,00:19:02.560,"Oh, they're such good friends."
00:19:02.640,00:19:04.840,I think they should be together...
00:19:22.600,00:19:26.840,"-How do we get them back? -Don't tell me, I know this one."
00:19:26.920,00:19:29.480,So do I. I've heard it.
00:19:32.960,00:19:35.800,"Each to her own, let the truth be shown."
00:19:46.120,00:19:48.680,I nearly ate you. Who did this?
00:19:56.280,00:19:59.560,And she trapped Miss Cackle in the painting.
00:20:00.120,00:20:03.840,"And turned the Great Wizard into a balloon, don't forget that."
00:20:04.800,00:20:09.000,My methods are a tad unorthodox...
00:20:14.200,00:20:16.840,And there's nothing any of you can do about it.
00:20:16.920,00:20:18.000,"Yes, there is."
00:20:20.760,00:20:23.840,Hands up who wants Agatha in charge.
00:20:32.640,00:20:35.680,"If you don't leave, we all will."
00:20:38.760,00:20:40.000,You can't.
00:20:40.520,00:20:45.120,"Without us, you have nothing to be headmistress of."
00:20:47.440,00:20:48.440,All right.
00:20:56.600,00:20:58.680,You're... You're actually going?
00:20:58.760,00:21:01.200,I always dreamed of running this place.
00:21:01.280,00:21:05.720,"But a school consists of people, not bricks and mortar."
00:21:06.680,00:21:13.000,"So, it doesn't really matter if I do this."
00:21:15.440,00:21:25.440,"Bricks and stone, beams and slate, all must fall, annihilate!"
00:21:52.720,00:21:55.240,"Make it last, hold it fast!"
00:21:56.960,00:21:58.240,You stopped Agatha's spell?
00:21:58.320,00:22:00.320,"No, just containing it!"
00:22:00.400,00:22:03.160,"When my strength runs out, the whole place falls!"
00:22:16.240,00:22:20.520,"Till we meet again, Mildred Hubble."
00:22:35.280,00:22:36.280,Esmerelda!
00:22:41.680,00:22:42.800,Keep moving!
00:23:04.840,00:23:05.960,We aren't many...
00:23:08.120,00:23:09.120,we are one.
00:23:18.880,00:23:21.560,"We aren't many, we are one!"
00:23:22.520,00:23:25.120,"We aren't many, we are one!"
00:23:28.160,00:23:30.400,"We aren't many, we are one!"
00:23:30.480,00:23:32.960,"We aren't many, we are one!"
00:23:35.840,00:23:38.040,"We aren't many, we are one!"
00:23:38.120,00:23:40.600,"We aren't many, we are one!"
00:23:40.680,00:23:43.200,"We aren't many, we are one!"
00:23:43.280,00:23:45.840,"We aren't many, we are one!"
00:23:45.920,00:23:48.280,Agatha's spell shall be undone!
00:23:48.360,00:23:51.000,Agatha's spell shall be undone!
00:24:48.400,00:24:49.320,Miss Hardbroom.
00:25:00.640,00:25:03.080,"I am truly sorry, Your Greatness."
00:25:05.360,00:25:07.640,I suppose there's no real harm done.
00:25:08.840,00:25:10.320,Thanks to Mildred.
00:25:20.800,00:25:26.160,"We just... well, I don't really know. But I don't think we could do it again."
00:25:27.640,00:25:29.160,You won't have to.
00:25:46.800,00:25:49.400,I promise I'll leave your school alone.
00:25:49.480,00:25:51.360,"Yes, you will."
00:25:51.960,00:25:53.680,"Ada, please."
00:25:53.760,00:25:55.520,I'm your sister.
00:25:56.360,00:25:57.320,"Yes, you are."
00:25:57.960,00:26:00.080,But my girls come first.
00:26:04.400,00:26:05.880,"I'm sorry, Agatha."
00:26:17.600,00:26:19.040,You did the right thing.
00:26:19.320,00:26:20.320,Yes.
00:26:21.000,00:26:23.560,"For all her faults, she loved this place."
00:26:24.280,00:26:25.120,Hm.
00:26:26.440,00:26:28.120,Now she will never leave it.
00:26:34.680,00:26:35.840,Now...
00:26:36.640,00:26:39.120,how are the First Years doing in their exams?
00:26:42.280,00:26:44.640,I can't believe they're still making her do this.
00:26:44.720,00:26:46.840,I can't believe they gave her a new broom.
00:26:47.520,00:26:51.960,"Look at the way she sits on it, like a sack of rotten pumpkins."
00:26:52.040,00:26:54.680,"Keep going, Millie, you crafty crow!"
00:26:59.480,00:27:00.560,Millie!
00:27:09.760,00:27:15.520,You slammed into a tree and ruined a very expensive new broomstick.
00:27:15.600,00:27:18.480,Most examiners would fail you for this.
00:27:19.160,00:27:23.360,"I, however, am not most examiners."
00:27:23.440,00:27:33.040,"So, averaging this mark with your written papers gives you a final mark of 51 percent, which means you have passed."
00:27:49.240,00:27:51.240,See you next year!
00:00:41.520,00:00:43.040,"Come on, we'll be late."
00:00:47.800,00:00:50.320,Hurry! I want to talk to my mum!
00:00:56.880,00:00:58.320,Look at the queue!
00:01:08.240,00:01:09.800,"You won't be long, will you, Ethel?"
00:01:09.880,00:01:12.040,"I mean, um, we're really busy."
00:01:12.120,00:01:15.040,We're revising for Miss Bat's witchery test tomorrow.
00:01:15.120,00:01:17.000,We kind of lost track of time.
00:01:17.080,00:01:20.600,"And unless this queue gets moving, we're not going to have time to ring home."
00:01:20.680,00:01:24.280,"This will be a call of considerable length, actually."
00:01:24.360,00:01:27.360,Mother's going to want to hear everything I've achieved today.
00:01:27.440,00:01:33.440,"And whilst it might not take you two long to detail your achievements, it can take a Hallow forever."
00:01:34.960,00:01:37.280,S-Sorry about that. I didn't...
00:01:41.160,00:01:44.840,"Apologies, darling, can't chat now. Magic Council."
00:01:49.080,00:01:50.400,Must fly!
00:02:07.200,00:02:13.280,Um... is Drusilla OK to go in now or...?
00:02:14.240,00:02:22.960,"Drusilla is, but I'm not sure you are, We've done plenty."
00:02:25.200,00:02:32.680,I imagine it's practically impossible to get your head around the entirety of witch history when you're not one.
00:02:35.080,00:02:39.520,"Yes, she is. Even the Great Wizard said so."
00:02:39.600,00:02:41.880,"Not from a witching family, though, is she?"
00:02:44.520,00:02:47.480,Some of us come top whether we work for it or not...
00:02:48.040,00:02:52.320,"whilst others always come bottom, no matter what."
00:02:52.400,00:02:53.400,"Well, not this time!"
00:02:54.320,00:02:56.400,"This time, I'm going to surprise a few people."
00:03:07.400,00:03:10.240,Who am I kidding? I'm not going to surprise anyone.
00:03:16.280,00:03:18.280,Haven't you ever heard of a wisdom spell?
00:03:18.360,00:03:21.880,"If you found out how to do one of those, you'd be the cleverest girl in school."
00:03:23.040,00:03:26.440,"Enid, Mildred would never do a spell for selfish gain."
00:03:26.520,00:03:28.080,It's against the code.
00:03:30.080,00:03:33.280,And she's wise enough to know not to break it.
00:03:38.480,00:03:40.320,Cleverest girl in the school?
00:03:46.120,00:03:55.040,"Here's one. To understand in 40,000 ways, find the stocking of one who's lived for 40,000 days."
00:03:56.080,00:04:03.760,"Add a beetle's blood and a frog's tears, and lo, you shall see the world far beyond your years."
00:04:06.600,00:04:09.080,Where are we going to find a century-old sock?
00:05:32.640,00:05:36.760,"Lights out, Miss Hallow. Study time is over."
00:06:03.600,00:06:06.200,"Miss Hardbroom, come quickly!"
00:06:18.360,00:06:20.680,I think she's going to be needing some time off.
00:06:20.760,00:06:23.720,"We'll have to get someone in to replace her, then."
00:06:23.800,00:06:27.760,Her witchery class has a rather important test tomorrow afternoon.
00:06:27.840,00:06:31.400,-And children can't teach themselves. -Let me see what I can do.
00:06:32.400,00:06:39.880,Give me a mind greater than my own and turn me into the cleverest of crones.
00:06:57.680,00:06:59.280,"Um, I'm not sure."
00:07:00.960,00:07:03.600,Ask me about any moment in the whole history of witchcraft.
00:07:04.320,00:07:09.640,"Which king of England banned all witches from his kingdom, forcing us underground for eternity?"
00:07:09.720,00:07:11.080,Um...
00:07:12.760,00:07:15.240,Uh... Something else.
00:07:15.320,00:07:18.680,I'll give you a clue. He had a big belly and a bushy beard.
00:07:18.760,00:07:21.520,"-Oh, Father Christmas! -No!"
00:07:24.000,00:07:28.920,"Oh, Mildred, it definitely hasn't worked. What are you going to do?"
00:07:29.000,00:07:30.720,There's only one thing I can do.
00:07:31.880,00:07:33.240,Revise.
00:07:44.320,00:07:46.240,Want to put an extra hour in now?
00:07:52.200,00:07:53.280,What?
00:07:55.680,00:07:57.520,What have you done with Mildred?
00:08:00.600,00:08:03.320,"Are you feeling OK, Maud?"
00:08:07.120,00:08:11.960,"Mildred, is that... really you?"
00:08:12.040,00:08:13.400,Who else would it be?
00:08:14.640,00:08:16.840,You look terrible.
00:08:16.920,00:08:21.160,Excuse me. No one looks their best first thing.
00:08:21.240,00:08:23.560,Anyone can have a bad hair day.
00:08:23.640,00:08:25.760,It's a lot worse than that.
00:08:39.880,00:08:42.679,"No, Mildred, you didn't."
00:08:45.480,00:08:50.360,Just look at your skin. It's so stretchy.
00:08:50.440,00:08:52.600,I need to go and see Miss Cackle straight away!
00:08:52.680,00:08:55.760,"No, you don't. Think about how much trouble we'd get into."
00:08:55.840,00:08:57.160,Maud!
00:08:58.560,00:08:59.800,Where you going?
00:09:00.360,00:09:06.720,"Well, if it's possible to magic you into a doddery old body, it must be possible to magic you out."
00:09:14.600,00:09:20.000,"Uh, Esmerelda, do you know anything about... wisdom spells?"
00:09:20.640,00:09:22.440,"A little bit, yes."
00:09:22.520,00:09:25.360,We're doing a... project on them.
00:09:26.040,00:09:31.240,"And this book tells me how to do one, but not how to undo it."
00:09:31.320,00:09:33.680,"Well, that's because you can't."
00:09:34.680,00:09:36.800,These are time spells.
00:09:37.440,00:09:40.240,"Only time can undo them, not you."
00:09:40.320,00:09:45.200,"It might be a week, a month, even a year. You just have to wait and see."
00:09:49.040,00:09:57.400,"-Uh, you, girl. Come here. -Sorry, I'm in a bit of a-- When a witch asks you to do something, it is not optional."
00:10:07.040,00:10:08.200,Thank you.
00:10:08.840,00:10:12.920,"I am Miss Darkside, the supply witch."
00:10:13.000,00:10:22.360,"Apparently, someone called Miss Bat has lost all her marbles and one of her socks, and I am here to replace her."
00:10:22.920,00:10:27.080,Do you have any idea where your headteacher might be?
00:10:28.080,00:10:31.400,"Yes. Yes, I think I might."
00:10:33.320,00:10:36.720,"Miss Darkside, this is Miss Cackle."
00:10:36.800,00:10:48.080,"Um, there seems to be a bit of a mix-up, though, as Miss Cackle was just telling us that Miss Bat is now absolutely fine and there is no need for a supply witch."
00:10:48.920,00:10:49.920,Is this true?
00:10:51.000,00:10:52.040,Mmm.
00:10:52.520,00:10:56.560,This place is even more chaotic than I'd heard.
00:10:58.920,00:11:01.360,I thought you were going to make things better.
00:11:05.440,00:11:08.560,Do you know the punishment for impersonating a teacher?
00:11:08.640,00:11:11.440,A whole term of cat confiscation.
00:11:11.520,00:11:14.440,"Ah! Miss Darkside, I presume."
00:11:14.520,00:11:16.840,"Oh! Yes, that's me."
00:11:27.520,00:11:30.800,Miss Darkside's been through a bit of a crisis.
00:11:30.880,00:11:32.440,Mildred's mum's been taken ill...
00:11:33.120,00:11:35.800,and Mildred had to go home to look after her.
00:11:36.240,00:11:39.080,"Oh, dear. What's the matter?"
00:11:39.760,00:11:40.760,Uh...
00:11:44.920,00:11:47.440,Is that really serious enough to miss school?
00:11:48.320,00:11:51.560,This one is. It's particularly invasive.
00:11:51.640,00:11:55.960,"Oh. Well, how long will Mildred be?"
00:11:56.280,00:11:59.680,A week. Maybe a month.
00:12:00.400,00:12:03.520,Even a year. We'll just have to wait and see.
00:12:03.960,00:12:05.120,Well...
00:12:06.480,00:12:09.680,"Show Miss Darkside to your classroom, please, will you, Maud?"
00:12:10.080,00:12:13.000,-She's in with you. -Just this way.
00:12:48.840,00:12:51.480,"Um... Morning, everyone."
00:12:52.760,00:12:56.080,I am... Mil...
00:12:56.760,00:12:58.960,Millicent Darkside...
00:12:59.040,00:13:00.160,and I'm...
00:13:00.920,00:13:03.480,I-I'm c-covering for Miss Bat.
00:13:14.640,00:13:16.400,"Or post them, either's good."
00:13:20.320,00:13:23.040,-that isn't even hers? -That's right.
00:13:23.480,00:13:26.400,"No, it isn't. She made that up to get out of the test."
00:13:27.160,00:13:33.440,The only way possible for her not to come bottom was for her not to sit it in the first place.
00:13:39.960,00:13:47.600,"Right, I think it's time I started teaching, with me being the teacher."
00:13:50.280,00:13:51.280,So...
00:13:52.920,00:13:57.360,"-What would Miss Bat do now, I wonder. -Fall asleep?"
00:14:00.040,00:14:06.280,Our test. She'd help us prepare for the test by telling us a story from witching history.
00:14:09.960,00:14:13.560,"Right, um... OK."
00:14:15.360,00:14:17.400,"The door. Come in, please."
00:14:26.560,00:14:28.880,Miss Darkside?
00:14:28.960,00:14:33.000,"Uh, yes, that's me. It's definitely me."
00:14:38.960,00:14:41.720,"Miss Hardbroom, deputy head."
00:14:53.440,00:14:55.360,"Just checking, you're settling in OK?"
00:15:04.640,00:15:09.560,"And what exactly is my reputation these days, then?"
00:15:09.720,00:15:16.000,As one of the greatest disciplinarians of the entire witch academy network...
00:15:16.240,00:15:19.080,famed for upholding tradition...
00:15:20.120,00:15:24.840,"in demanding order, instilling fear."
00:15:27.960,00:15:32.520,"M-Morning, everyone. I am your teacher, so I'll t-t-teach."
00:15:35.040,00:15:37.240,"Are you laughing, girl?"
00:15:37.320,00:15:41.600,I've known your sort before and I'll break you like I broke them!
00:15:42.440,00:15:46.560,"-Out of my class, both of you! -Both?"
00:15:46.640,00:15:49.040,"Miss Darkside, I won't do it again."
00:15:49.560,00:15:51.080,Out!
00:15:56.680,00:15:58.360,That's what I heard.
00:16:02.720,00:16:04.360,"Right, first-years."
00:16:06.040,00:16:08.240,Let's do this together.
00:16:08.320,00:16:15.120,"When James VI of Scotland became king of England, too, witches everywhere rejoiced..."
00:16:15.720,00:16:20.320,because they thought things were about to get easier. But...
00:16:22.640,00:16:24.880,"-No, still don't like them. -Boo!"
00:16:24.960,00:16:26.320,Off with their heads!
00:16:26.400,00:16:28.920,And the witches weren't best pleased.
00:16:29.000,00:16:34.480,A whole head seems rather extreme. How about a finger instead?
00:16:34.560,00:16:45.000,"But old Jambo was not for turning, so a certain Guy Fawkes, the great wizard of his day, assembled a meeting of the council."
00:16:45.480,00:16:47.440,There are three choices.
00:16:47.520,00:16:50.800,"One, we have a stern word."
00:16:50.880,00:16:53.920,"Two, we take his dinner money, yeah."
00:16:56.480,00:17:00.800,And that's how the Gunpowder Plot really came to be.
00:17:01.640,00:17:09.560,Fawkes had magicked himself beneath Parliament and lit a fuse leading to a whacking great barrel!
00:17:11.840,00:17:16.680,"But that morning, the king received a peculiar postcard."
00:17:18.599,00:17:23.319,"Dear Jambo, Weather here nice. Don't think much of the food."
00:17:23.800,00:17:26.400,PS: You're about to go splat!
00:17:27.599,00:17:33.320,"So, as the barrel was about to boom..."
00:17:34.960,00:17:36.160,Guy said...
00:17:36.240,00:17:40.880,"Uh, awkward. I suppose you'll be wanting my head?"
00:17:42.760,00:17:49.480,"But instead of flinging him on the fire like those non-witches do, we celebrated instead."
00:17:51.480,00:17:53.400,You're the best teacher ever.
00:17:57.120,00:18:01.200,"What a splendid command of witchery, Miss Darkside."
00:18:01.280,00:18:04.680,A passion for education as well as discipline.
00:18:05.800,00:18:08.520,This is Millicent Darkside.
00:18:16.000,00:18:18.760,But don't be scared. I save that stuff for the kids.
00:18:18.840,00:18:20.760,I'll be a pussycat with you.
00:18:22.320,00:18:24.080,How's Miss Bat?
00:18:28.440,00:18:33.600,Her conversation is still almost entirely sock-centered.
00:18:36.760,00:18:41.000,"Strictly speaking, she should have left many moons ago."
00:18:41.720,00:18:44.360,Perhaps now's the time.
00:18:44.760,00:18:47.720,I don't know what I'd do without her.
00:18:48.720,00:18:53.120,"If she goes, I'll have to consider my own future too."
00:18:55.960,00:18:58.160,"If you're OK here, Miss Darkside..."
00:18:58.760,00:19:02.480,I'm going to go and give Mildred Hubble's mother a call.
00:19:07.680,00:19:09.240,Where are we going?
00:19:16.200,00:19:17.240,Shh!
00:19:20.640,00:19:23.800,Proving that Mildred really is skipping the test.
00:19:24.520,00:19:26.760,All it needs is for Miss Cackle to ring her mum.
00:19:30.040,00:19:35.680,"Mildred's mum asked specifically not to be disturbed, not until she feels a little better."
00:19:41.360,00:19:43.360,Then I'll speak to Mildred instead.
00:19:44.760,00:19:46.360,You've got to be kidding me. No.
00:19:49.320,00:19:55.040,I just saw Miss Bat heading across the Great Hall carrying every single sock she owns. Is everything OK?
00:20:00.920,00:20:03.080,A little marking for you to be getting on with.
00:20:06.320,00:20:08.800,"And Miss Bat's test for this afternoon, answers included."
00:20:08.880,00:20:14.240,"Though I'm quite sure you, of all people, don't need them."
00:20:14.320,00:20:15.840,"Ready, it's ringing."
00:20:25.360,00:20:29.160,Hello. It's Ada Cackle here from Cackle's Academy.
00:20:29.240,00:20:32.000,"-Um, just... yes, sorry to trouble you. -Yes?"
00:20:32.080,00:20:35.200,Just ringing to inquire about your toenail troubles.
00:20:42.720,00:20:45.200,Mildred Hubble's not at home with her mum!
00:20:46.600,00:20:50.960,"Really, Ethel, the staff have told me all about your tendency for tall tales."
00:20:51.040,00:20:54.920,This isn't a tall tale. Her mum told us herself.
00:20:55.000,00:20:56.000,What?
00:20:56.080,00:20:59.000,"Miss Darkside, I'm not one of the bad ones."
00:20:59.080,00:21:00.720,I work harder than anyone else.
00:21:00.800,00:21:02.800,"No, you don't, it just comes naturally to you."
00:21:02.880,00:21:04.120,I wish it did.
00:21:04.440,00:21:08.760,Maybe then my mum would be even half as interested in me as my sister.
00:21:09.240,00:21:10.440,Are you serious?
00:21:10.520,00:21:13.600,Yes. So you have to believe me.
00:21:17.480,00:21:19.920,because her mum's toes are absolutely fine.
00:21:22.640,00:21:26.440,I think it really is time I gave the Hubble household a call.
00:21:30.040,00:21:33.800,I'm going to be absolutely honest. This is not going to plan.
00:21:33.880,00:21:35.240,"No, but it still can."
00:21:37.240,00:21:38.920,You've got the answers.
00:21:40.320,00:21:44.200,Doing well at something doesn't mean anything if you haven't put the effort in.
00:21:44.880,00:21:47.600,Even the teachers work really hard.
00:21:49.040,00:21:53.240,It turns out I know quite a lot of witchery anyway.
00:21:53.320,00:21:54.600,I could even teach it.
00:21:57.720,00:21:59.840,It's time I told the truth.
00:22:13.720,00:22:19.920,"I'm sorry to bother you both, but there's something I have to tell you."
00:22:21.640,00:22:24.520,I am Mildred Hubble.
00:22:25.600,00:22:27.160,"Yes, we can see that, dear."
00:22:29.280,00:22:33.760,"Oh! Yeah, so can I. It's so wonderful to be me!"
00:22:34.640,00:22:38.880,"Well, that's good to hear. But where have you been?"
00:22:38.960,00:22:42.320,And what are you wearing?
00:22:50.600,00:22:54.120,that there might not be anything wrong with your mother.
00:22:54.200,00:22:55.560,Is that right?
00:22:56.760,00:22:59.320,"If they speak to her mum, the game's still up."
00:22:59.400,00:23:00.400,Not if I can help it.
00:23:00.480,00:23:03.320,There's a spell. It's only supposed to work on witches.
00:23:04.080,00:23:05.240,Come on.
00:23:11.840,00:23:14.080,"How I'd put it, she..."
00:23:34.280,00:23:37.400,"Oh, why use technology when you can use magic?"
00:23:44.840,00:23:51.200,"It's A, Candle in the Wind, and it's Julie Hubble. Yes, H..."
00:23:54.600,00:23:56.680,You have got to stop doing that.
00:23:57.320,00:24:00.320,"-Everything all right, Mildred, love? -Yes, Mum, it's fine."
00:24:00.400,00:24:03.800,"Oh. This isn't about the state of my toenails again, is it?"
00:24:08.360,00:24:12.880,"I'm not sure what's been going on here, but it's clear something has."
00:24:12.960,00:24:19.600,"Dink-a-doo, dink-a-din, just for one afternoon only, let Miss Hubble's toenail grow in and in and in!"
00:24:23.480,00:24:26.600,I think that's all the answer we need.
00:24:31.040,00:24:33.560,I must return to the classroom.
00:24:33.640,00:24:35.240,"Miss Bat, you need your rest."
00:24:35.320,00:24:37.560,Staying in bed just makes things worse.
00:24:37.960,00:24:39.960,They're tinkering with my toenails now.
00:24:40.560,00:24:42.400,I'm safer at work.
00:24:42.480,00:24:44.920,"Well, I'm sorry, that isn't going to be possible."
00:24:45.000,00:24:48.280,We've found a rather capable replacement.
00:24:48.360,00:24:51.200,"Oh, but that's what I've come to tell you."
00:24:56.880,00:24:59.240,about this not being the place for her?
00:24:59.320,00:25:01.440,And she just flew off through the window.
00:25:02.080,00:25:04.480,Miss Darkside has gone?
00:25:08.480,00:25:11.560,-Miss Darkside wasn't a patch on you. -Oh!
00:25:14.720,00:25:18.200,What? What about me?
00:25:22.640,00:25:24.600,"Uh, was I bottom?"
00:25:24.680,00:25:26.600,Not quite. That was Drusilla.
00:25:27.360,00:25:29.360,You were second from bottom.
00:25:29.440,00:25:32.040,This is the greatest moment in my entire life!
00:25:32.360,00:25:34.440,I'm only the second-worst witch!
00:25:34.640,00:25:44.200,"I'm not sure it's anything to get too carried away with, Mildred, but I am impressed that you picked up all that witch history so quickly."
00:25:44.280,00:25:52.520,"Sorry to interrupt, Miss Bat, but we have reason to believe that someone in this class has impersonated a teacher."
00:26:02.920,00:26:04.320,Did you ring Julie Hubble?
00:26:06.440,00:26:09.560,No. I-I did.
00:26:13.800,00:26:16.840,"Miss Paddock, fetch your feline."
00:26:22.600,00:26:24.880,I shall be speaking to your mother.
00:26:34.560,00:26:35.560,"Esmerelda, no."
00:26:38.880,00:26:43.200,Mother didn't talk to her last night and she's desperate to make up for it.
00:26:43.280,00:26:45.000,Of course. After you.
00:26:45.560,00:26:48.440,"Come on, she wants to hear about everything you've achieved today."
00:26:48.520,00:26:52.320,"Sorry, can't chat now. Another time, hey?"
00:26:57.920,00:27:01.160,"Oh, how did you get on with your project about the wisdom spell?"
00:27:20.800,00:27:22.920,You were Miss Darkside.
00:27:25.040,00:27:28.120,"Yes, Ethel, I was."
00:27:28.640,00:27:32.200,"And it was your idea to impersonate a teacher and call my mum, wasn't it?"
00:27:38.320,00:27:41.400,"Oh, Maud, I'm so pleased you knew that toenail spell."
00:27:42.040,00:27:45.600,-You sure she'll be all right by now? -Positive.
00:27:46.760,00:27:49.480,I can't believe that it actually did the trick.
00:27:50.280,00:27:55.440,"My spell book said it only worked on witches, but... I guess it must be wrong."
00:27:58.240,00:27:59.680,Unless...
00:28:02.400,00:28:06.760,What if my mum really is a witch after all?
00:28:09.000,00:28:10.320,"Hello, Millie, love."
00:00:41.920,00:00:43.880,What do you suppose the announcement is?
00:00:43.960,00:00:46.640,"Well, I heard that Miss Cackle was kidnapped by an evil wizard."
00:00:46.720,00:00:51.440,And I heard Miss Tapioca was caught putting pond slime in her stew.
00:00:51.520,00:00:59.280,And I heard that Miss Hardbroom was turned into a gargoyle and her eyes were so scary that they could turn you into stone!
00:00:59.960,00:01:04.920,"Why don't we test that theory in tonight's detention, Maud?"
00:01:10.120,00:01:15.280,"As some of you have heard, Miss Cackle has some news she would like to share with us all."
00:01:16.080,00:01:17.280,Is everyone here?
00:01:17.360,00:01:21.160,"Everyone except Mildred Hubble, Miss Hardbroom."
00:01:21.240,00:01:25.320,And does anyone know if she'll be gracing us with her presence?
00:01:25.400,00:01:28.480,-Um... She's practicing her chanting. -Broomstick.
00:01:28.560,00:01:31.000,She's chanting on her broomstick.
00:01:33.160,00:01:36.800,It would seem Mildred Hubble has a more pressing engagement.
00:01:36.880,00:01:37.920,"Oh, dear!"
00:01:38.400,00:01:41.840,"That girl really does have her head in the clouds, doesn't she?"
00:01:48.520,00:01:49.760,"Please, Tabby!"
00:01:51.560,00:01:55.320,"Now I know that nasty mouse scared you, but you need to come down."
00:01:59.640,00:02:11.640,"Please, Tabby! I'm already late for-- I-I'm sorry, Miss Cackle. It was Tabby."
00:02:11.720,00:02:14.200,He got scared by a mouse and ran up to the roof.
00:02:21.960,00:02:28.000,"As I'm sure you're all aware, Cackle's Academy are currently reigning champions of the annual spelling bee."
00:02:31.640,00:02:33.920,where you mix potions to see who's the best at spells.
00:02:37.800,00:02:47.520,"we are guaranteed a place in this year's finals to be held here tomorrow, which means two lucky witches will have the honor of competing against Miss Pentangle's Academy."
00:02:48.000,00:02:50.440,-Miss Pentangle? -That's right.
00:02:55.560,00:02:57.880,I begged my mother to send me to her school.
00:02:57.960,00:03:00.120,-So why didn't you go? -Because it's co-ed.
00:03:02.440,00:03:06.320,"As the rules dictate, we will continue to work our way through the alphabet."
00:03:06.400,00:03:12.600,"Our official judicator, Mr. Rowan Webb, has been charged with selecting this year's team."
00:03:12.680,00:03:25.920,"Last year's victory by Hazel Goodcharm and Peggy... ribbit... Gribble brings us to H, which means our first lucky contestant is Ethel Hallow."
00:03:28.760,00:03:31.040,"Here, this should keep you going till lunch."
00:03:31.120,00:03:33.480,Swiftly followed by Mildred Hubble.
00:03:36.000,00:03:39.640,Me? Um... I think someone else should go in my place.
00:03:39.720,00:03:44.160,"That isn't allowed, I'm afraid. Witching traditions always prevail."
00:03:47.280,00:03:48.600,You see this?
00:03:49.720,00:03:53.200,I've dreamt about holding this trophy since I got my first broom.
00:03:53.800,00:04:00.120,"We lose this, and I'll never forgive you, Mildred Hubble, ever."
00:04:02.440,00:04:04.120,You could still win it!
00:04:05.640,00:04:06.560,Ethel's right.
00:04:07.320,00:04:09.040,I'm rubbish at spells.
00:04:09.120,00:04:10.960,"You just need to practice, that's all."
00:04:11.600,00:04:13.080,I know what'll cheer you up.
00:04:13.160,00:04:16.720,Last one to the stairwell's an old toad.
00:04:19.200,00:04:22.000,Mildred Hubble. Where do you think you're going?
00:04:22.079,00:04:23.560,"It's our break, Miss Hardbroom."
00:04:24.320,00:04:27.680,There will be no more breaks or fun.
00:04:28.320,00:04:31.600,We have a competition to prepare for.
00:04:34.720,00:04:36.360,"Come on, Mildred, you can do it!"
00:04:43.400,00:04:46.560,"This is no time to rest, Mildred Hubble."
00:04:46.640,00:04:50.200,"Potions Lab, this instant."
00:04:53.800,00:04:57.200,"Right, let's start with some basics."
00:04:57.280,00:05:00.680,"Level 1, the sneezing spell."
00:05:04.120,00:05:05.560,"Um, feather of crow?"
00:05:05.840,00:05:07.920,-And? -Dragonwort.
00:05:08.000,00:05:12.200,And the most important ingredient of them all?
00:05:13.560,00:05:14.680,Eyes of newt?
00:05:14.760,00:05:17.920,Eyes of newt.
00:05:18.000,00:05:23.040,I've met chimps with a better grasp of spells. Ethel?
00:05:23.120,00:05:25.200,"The sap of a honeysuckle, Miss Hardbroom."
00:05:25.280,00:05:28.760,I see we're going to have to start at the very beginning.
00:05:29.360,00:05:33.000,Get out your cauldrons.
00:06:00.200,00:06:01.200,Tabby.
00:06:01.280,00:06:04.440,That's it. That insufferable creature has to go.
00:06:04.520,00:06:08.720,Miss Tapioca. Take Tabby down to the kitchen.
00:06:08.800,00:06:10.600,"Oh, you leave him with me, Miss Hardbroom."
00:06:10.680,00:06:13.200,I'll soon lick that scrawny fellow into shape.
00:06:24.040,00:06:27.800,Broomstick privileges revoked for a week.
00:06:27.880,00:06:30.760,"Still as strict as ever, I see, Hecate."
00:06:30.840,00:06:31.680,Pippa.
00:06:33.280,00:06:34.880,"Well met, Hecate."
00:06:38.880,00:06:40.600,You're looking very...
00:06:42.760,00:06:43.800,pink.
00:06:44.520,00:06:47.120,Haven't you been keeping up with the latest trends?
00:06:47.200,00:06:50.080,Black is so last century.
00:06:50.160,00:06:52.520,Vanity is very unbecoming in a witch.
00:06:52.600,00:06:56.800,"But along with pink, not against the Witches' Code."
00:06:57.480,00:07:01.680,"So, which of you girls is competing against my school?"
00:07:01.760,00:07:04.160,"Ethel Hallow, Miss Pentangle."
00:07:04.240,00:07:08.680,"Ah, Hallow. I knew your mother. I see we have our work cut out."
00:07:12.360,00:07:13.240,Mildred Hubble.
00:07:14.920,00:07:22.080,Hubble. I believe I don't know who-- Mildred comes from a family of witches based in the far seas.
00:07:29.560,00:07:32.120,And who will we be competing against?
00:07:32.560,00:07:35.040,Two of my very best students.
00:07:35.120,00:07:37.640,I'm sure you'll all get on like a coven on fire!
00:07:37.720,00:07:41.800,-I'd like to introduce Sapphire Hailstone. -I better get back to my cauldron.
00:07:41.880,00:07:45.080,And Zac Hawthorn.
00:07:45.160,00:07:48.880,I'd like you to meet your fellow Bees: Mildred Hubble and Ethel Hallow.
00:07:49.680,00:07:53.360,"-Welcome to Cackle's. I'm Mildred. -Hey, Mildred. And you must be Ethel."
00:07:53.440,00:07:56.000,I... Uh...
00:07:59.640,00:08:01.400,Frogspawn.
00:08:02.800,00:08:05.000,"Smooth, Ethel, smooth."
00:08:09.840,00:08:12.800,Isn't Miss Pentangle the most beautiful witch you've ever seen?
00:08:12.880,00:08:16.320,Erica in Year 2 says they ride on gold-plated brooms.
00:08:16.400,00:08:20.320,And they get donuts every Sunday.
00:08:21.840,00:08:26.240,No delicious soup for you. It's brain food from now on.
00:08:27.000,00:08:30.120,"Dandelions and nettles, freshly picked this morning."
00:08:33.200,00:08:36.280,We heard about poor Tabby. Are you all right?
00:08:37.200,00:08:40.200,Maybe he can come back after the spelling bee's over.
00:08:47.400,00:08:49.520,I hear we've got tough competition tomorrow.
00:08:49.600,00:08:51.320,Ethel's the best at everything!
00:08:51.800,00:08:54.320,Then I'll have to try even harder if I want to win this.
00:08:58.120,00:09:00.640,-Where are you going? -To practice my spells.
00:09:00.720,00:09:02.960,"Poor Mill, she's so upset."
00:09:03.560,00:09:05.600,I know what we can do to cheer her up.
00:09:06.520,00:09:08.480,I'm not sure I like the sound of this.
00:09:09.080,00:09:11.040,"What are you, a witch?"
00:09:18.200,00:09:21.680,You look like a witch who's lost a broom and found a twig.
00:09:23.920,00:09:28.120,-Tabby? -He's my cat. Or at least he was.
00:09:48.280,00:09:52.720,"If Mildred's worrying about Tabby, she won't concentrate on her spells, will she?"
00:09:59.280,00:10:02.640,"They don't appreciate good, hearty home cooking."
00:10:03.440,00:10:06.560,I was hoping I might borrow one of your jellies.
00:10:06.640,00:10:09.320,At least someone appreciates my hard work.
00:10:11.480,00:10:15.080,"Tabby, you're here to catch mice, not eat my cheese!"
00:10:15.640,00:10:18.160,Do you know what I dislike more than children?
00:10:20.840,00:10:24.880,"You either toughen up or you're on the next broom to the cats' home, understood?"
00:10:24.960,00:10:28.440,Excellent! Ooh! Your best bounce yet!
00:10:37.600,00:10:42.520,"Last time Ethel tried to do that, Mildred nearly got expelled."
00:10:42.600,00:10:44.360,Then we better make sure we get it right.
00:11:03.360,00:11:05.040,I thought you might be hungry.
00:11:06.800,00:11:08.640,"Don't worry, I won't tell anyone."
00:11:09.880,00:11:13.800,"Dear old Hecate, she takes things so seriously."
00:11:15.080,00:11:16.200,How do you know each other?
00:11:18.360,00:11:20.120,We were friends once.
00:11:23.480,00:11:25.160,I'd rather not talk about it.
00:11:25.880,00:11:29.160,It was a broomstick water-skiing display.
00:11:29.240,00:11:35.120,"We'd been practicing all term, and then suddenly on the day of the competition, she didn't show up!"
00:11:35.880,00:11:39.480,Let's just say a doubles display with only one of you doesn't go well.
00:11:41.160,00:11:42.320,Still...
00:11:43.280,00:11:45.280,it's all in the past now.
00:11:50.560,00:11:53.400,"You're not the only one that's been doing their homework, you know."
00:11:54.160,00:11:58.080,"It would seem that you have saved this school not once, but twice."
00:11:58.160,00:11:59.640,"It was nothing, really."
00:11:59.720,00:12:04.760,"On the contrary, Mildred, Cackle's is very lucky to have you."
00:12:07.600,00:12:09.560,But what if I let everyone down?
00:12:10.200,00:12:12.560,"Oh, just do your best."
00:12:13.200,00:12:15.920,That's all I ask of any of my pupils.
00:12:18.760,00:12:20.360,Maybe this little man will cheer you up.
00:12:24.080,00:12:25.920,I'll leave you two to get re-acquainted.
00:12:38.640,00:12:42.760,"What is it, Tabby? You want me to keep studying?"
00:12:43.760,00:12:47.360,"All right, but only if you promise to go back to the kitchen."
00:12:47.960,00:12:50.240,"We don't want you getting in more trouble, do we?"
00:12:54.240,00:12:56.600,A weather spell. OK then.
00:13:09.400,00:13:13.560,"No more hiding, no more rests, rid this kitchen of its pests!"
00:13:18.880,00:13:21.440,"It better, or Tabby's for the high jump."
00:13:34.000,00:13:35.440,What happened?
00:13:35.520,00:13:38.640,"Mildred Hubble's useless potions, that's what."
00:13:38.720,00:13:40.080,I said I'm sorry.
00:13:41.680,00:13:44.000,Is Zac not joining us for breakfast?
00:13:44.720,00:13:47.160,He could cast a spell on me any time.
00:13:47.240,00:13:50.920,"He's just a boy. You've hung out with boys before, haven't you?"
00:13:54.920,00:13:55.800,Thanks.
00:13:55.880,00:13:57.320,I know you'll do us proud.
00:14:01.120,00:14:03.760,Why do I have to be paired off with the worst witch?
00:14:10.480,00:14:12.080,"You can do it, Mill."
00:14:13.160,00:14:15.560,I'd be better if I wasn't so worried about Tabby.
00:14:15.640,00:14:19.080,"Don't worry about Tabs, we've sorted it."
00:14:19.760,00:14:22.000,Sorted it how?
00:14:25.720,00:14:27.120,It just came at me!
00:14:27.200,00:14:30.320,"I heard a hiss. Suddenly, it all went black."
00:14:30.400,00:14:31.600,You were attacked?
00:14:31.680,00:14:34.680,"A viscous monster, it was. I'm lucky I got out alive."
00:14:37.120,00:14:41.040,It looks like Tabby tried to get rid of the wrong pest.
00:14:50.520,00:14:54.600,Oh! Don't mind us. We're just getting in a bit of last-minute practice.
00:14:55.440,00:14:57.400,My girls need their cauldrons.
00:14:57.480,00:14:59.760,"Oh, I'm sure they do, Hecate!"
00:15:00.280,00:15:03.640,Seven rounds. Are you sure you're up to it?
00:15:04.040,00:15:06.400,We are more than ready.
00:15:06.680,00:15:09.680,"Fellow Bees, the competition is about to start."
00:15:16.160,00:15:17.760,I thought of a new spell.
00:15:21.440,00:15:22.640,Have you got any better ideas?
00:15:22.720,00:15:24.800,"I do, as it happens."
00:15:26.040,00:15:28.160,"This is no time for snacks, Maud!"
00:15:28.240,00:15:30.960,"It's not for me, it's for the mouse."
00:15:35.320,00:15:37.920,"we're just going to have to do it for him, aren't we?"
00:15:41.320,00:15:44.880,"Ethel, you must take the lead in each round."
00:15:48.440,00:15:57.880,This is what happens when you let a girl from a non-witching family As are mine!
00:15:58.400,00:15:59.680,Let the buzzing commence.
00:16:06.000,00:16:09.400,Welcome to the Annual Interschool Spelling Bee.
00:16:10.000,00:16:16.160,"Representing Miss Cackle's Academy, we have Ethel Hallow and Mildred Hubble."
00:16:19.880,00:16:21.640,Don't mess this up!
00:16:32.800,00:16:34.080,What did you do that for?
00:16:39.320,00:16:43.240,He flew away on his mouse broom. How should I know?
00:16:48.520,00:16:52.480,-I can't just stand here doing nothing. -Why not? You do it every day.
00:16:56.440,00:16:57.800,Put down your ladles.
00:16:59.520,00:17:02.840,"Mildred, would you care to taste the camouflage potion?"
00:17:18.640,00:17:20.680,"Mr. Rowan Webb, if you'd be so kind."
00:17:34.040,00:17:35.680,Better luck next time.
00:17:57.160,00:18:00.040,I'm afraid Ethel just pipped you to the post.
00:18:12.520,00:18:16.520,"Remember, the spell is to lift the judges off the floor."
00:18:16.600,00:18:19.320,"Miss Pentangle, if you could adjudicate."
00:18:29.080,00:18:31.200,He's just a boy.
00:18:36.760,00:18:41.920,"Take this table, raise it high, brace the thunder, let it fly!"
00:18:53.640,00:18:54.640,I'm afraid it's a fail.
00:18:56.200,00:18:57.400,Zac.
00:18:58.200,00:19:02.040,"Take this table, make it soar, lift these witches off the floor!"
00:19:13.960,00:19:16.800,Round six to Pentangle's Academy!
00:19:36.960,00:19:40.400,I take it this is because you don't come from a witching family.
00:19:41.000,00:19:41.880,"Oh, don't worry."
00:19:42.560,00:19:45.560,We have people from all walks of life at my school.
00:19:46.520,00:19:47.600,You do?
00:19:49.400,00:19:51.680,"You're the odd one out here, Mildred."
00:19:51.760,00:19:55.120,Why not come to a school that's more suited to your gift?
00:19:56.240,00:19:57.520,You think I have a gift?
00:19:57.600,00:20:00.600,Oh! From the first moment I saw you.
00:20:03.080,00:20:04.680,Miss Hardbroom doesn't think so.
00:20:05.360,00:20:08.600,That's because she's set in her ways.
00:20:09.400,00:20:12.280,We're what you call a modern witches' school...
00:20:13.240,00:20:16.960,and it just so happens we have a scholarship up for grabs.
00:20:22.400,00:20:25.160,"We think you're a very special witch, Mildred."
00:20:26.040,00:20:27.560,We'd love to have you in our school.
00:20:33.600,00:20:35.640,The score is currently...
00:20:37.080,00:20:38.280,Hmm!
00:20:38.760,00:20:40.760,...tied at three bats each.
00:20:45.200,00:20:50.440,"I'd like to draw your attention to the rules, namely paragraph four, clause five."
00:20:50.520,00:20:53.400,"I'm well aware of the rules, Miss Pentangle."
00:20:53.920,00:21:03.680,"Well, the rules clearly state whoever took part in the penultimate round -cannot participate in the final spell. -She has a point."
00:21:05.160,00:21:07.720,"Mildred, could you step forward, please?"
00:21:08.680,00:21:09.680,Me?
00:21:17.040,00:21:20.240,"You're doing this to spite me, aren't you?"
00:21:20.320,00:21:25.120,I just remember what it's like to be shunted aside like an old broom.
00:21:25.200,00:21:27.000,Without further ado...
00:21:27.440,00:21:33.160,"Sapphire, Mildred, I'd like you to perform the weather spell."
00:21:35.040,00:21:39.080,And the clock starts now.
00:21:52.960,00:21:54.240,Oh...
00:21:56.720,00:21:57.720,Oh!
00:22:00.120,00:22:02.120,My beautiful kitchen!
00:22:11.760,00:22:13.520,The slime of a slug.
00:22:13.600,00:22:16.840,-It needs more slime. -I know what I'm doing.
00:22:16.920,00:22:18.320,And I'm the Great Wizard.
00:22:18.400,00:22:20.440,No conferring over there.
00:22:31.520,00:22:33.720,-I think I'm done. -Are you sure?
00:23:12.880,00:23:15.360,Mildred! Mildred! Stop!
00:23:15.920,00:23:20.600,"As official adjudicator, I am delighted to announce..."
00:23:21.320,00:23:24.360,Miss Cackle's Academy are the winners!
00:23:26.920,00:23:31.280,"Well done, Mildred. Who'd have thought you had it in you?"
00:23:46.840,00:23:48.880,Mildred! Mildred! Mildred!
00:23:52.960,00:23:56.120,It was a lucky guess. I did all the hard work.
00:23:56.200,00:23:58.720,I bet Miss Pentangle's hopping mad.
00:23:59.480,00:24:00.480,I did!
00:24:00.560,00:24:03.120,"Actually, she offered me a scholarship."
00:24:04.120,00:24:07.760,You're not going to accept... are you?
00:24:08.040,00:24:11.400,-Well-- -What on earth was that racket?
00:24:11.480,00:24:12.840,Where is Miss Hardbroom?
00:24:12.920,00:24:15.280,"Oh, she had to go and see someone, Miss Bat."
00:24:15.360,00:24:17.160,Does anyone know when she'll be back?
00:24:17.640,00:24:20.400,-I'll go and check on her if you like. -Oh. Very good.
00:24:21.040,00:24:24.680,The rest of you can write me an essay on the history of toads.
00:24:36.320,00:24:39.640,Mildred said Miss Cackle wanted to see me.
00:24:40.480,00:24:43.040,"That's funny, she said the same to me."
00:24:48.080,00:24:49.360,It would appear so.
00:24:55.240,00:24:58.240,I should probably tell you that I've offered Mildred a scholarship.
00:25:04.400,00:25:07.840,Is that the time? I've got a long flight ahead of me.
00:25:14.480,00:25:16.360,"You were my best friend, Hecate."
00:25:17.080,00:25:21.200,"And then suddenly, you stopped talking to me. Why?"
00:25:26.680,00:25:29.680,I didn't care about those silly witches.
00:25:29.760,00:25:32.240,You were the only one I wanted to be friends with.
00:25:34.640,00:25:41.600,"But I thought-- What, because you were the tall, gangly one, I'd rather spend time with them?"
00:25:45.440,00:25:49.640,All this time we've spent hating each other.
00:25:53.280,00:25:54.560,"I've missed you, Hiccup."
00:26:04.520,00:26:07.600,"I've missed you, too..."
00:26:10.120,00:26:11.000,Pipsqueak.
00:26:21.720,00:26:23.240,"I, uh... Excuse me."
00:26:25.520,00:26:28.320,I hear Miss Pentangle's offered you a scholarship.
00:26:31.120,00:26:32.920,And have you considered her offer?
00:26:33.880,00:26:37.080,"-Yes. -Well, don't keep us in suspense."
00:26:39.920,00:26:44.360,I want to stay here. I like being the odd one out.
00:26:47.200,00:26:49.840,"-Thank you for the offer, though. -You're welcome."
00:26:53.720,00:26:56.080,"So, what did you decide?"
00:26:59.440,00:27:01.560,You can't get rid of me that easily.
00:27:06.160,00:27:07.320,A toast.
00:27:07.400,00:27:10.600,To the best speller at Cackle's Academy.
00:27:13.960,00:27:16.360,"-What are you doing? -Oh, I'm saving it for Tabby."
00:27:16.440,00:27:18.440,-The thing is-- -We were trying to help.
00:27:18.520,00:27:19.640,Has something happened?
00:27:21.400,00:27:24.440,is as bad at catching mice as you are at spells.
00:27:30.240,00:27:31.240,As you were.
00:27:41.000,00:27:44.480,We better get this back to the trophy cabinet before Ethel finds out it's gone.
00:27:46.040,00:27:49.040,"-You know what this means, don't you? -You're no longer the worst witch."
00:00:43.680,00:00:51.400,"and Central and Southern England will have a mixture of sunshine and showers, with rain in the evening over South Wales and South West England."
00:01:16.520,00:01:18.240,-Mildred? -Mum.
00:01:18.320,00:01:20.200,-You OK? -Yes.
00:01:24.880,00:01:25.760,No.
00:01:28.120,00:01:31.680,-I... I thought I saw... -What?
00:01:38.320,00:01:39.320,Sorry.
00:01:39.400,00:01:41.600,Were you making me breakfast in bed?
00:01:41.680,00:01:44.640,You've been on lates all week. I thought it would be a nice surprise.
00:01:44.720,00:01:45.720,Come here.
00:01:46.560,00:01:50.840,"That's a lovely thought, but you don't have to worry about me, you know."
00:01:53.360,00:01:56.880,"-Ooh, now that's good. -It's not really."
00:01:57.600,00:02:00.160,"-The perspective's all wrong. -No, I like it."
00:02:00.600,00:02:04.200,You paint what you see. That's what makes it interesting.
00:02:11.120,00:02:13.560,"-Right. I better get-- -No, no. I'll do it."
00:02:14.080,00:02:15.080,Thanks.
00:02:42.960,00:02:45.960,"Sorry, I lost my glasses, couldn't see where I was going."
00:02:46.720,00:02:47.720,It's real.
00:02:54.920,00:02:58.560,"I know. I passed my broomstick proficiency test, first time."
00:03:00.080,00:03:02.320,"So, are you..."
00:03:03.120,00:03:04.800,Are you a witch?
00:03:04.880,00:03:08.560,"I hope so, as long as I can make it to the entrance exam in time."
00:03:09.120,00:03:10.320,Entrance exam?
00:03:14.280,00:03:19.520,Academy? Like... a school for witches?
00:03:19.600,00:03:20.720,"Well, of course!"
00:03:21.520,00:03:23.760,But I'll never get there without my glasses.
00:03:23.880,00:03:25.480,"You haven't seen them, have you?"
00:03:28.160,00:03:30.640,No. But we can find them.
00:04:05.600,00:04:08.400,"If they fell off just before you landed, they can't be far."
00:04:09.800,00:04:11.200,We just have to keep looking.
00:04:27.480,00:04:30.800,"-I've let everyone down. -No, you haven't."
00:04:30.880,00:04:33.160,"I'll help you, I promise."
00:04:33.560,00:04:36.320,"Mildred. You all right, love?"
00:04:36.400,00:04:40.400,"Uh, yeah. Yes, it's just her glasses are broken."
00:04:41.160,00:04:42.200,Whose?
00:04:45.320,00:04:46.320,Hers?
00:04:52.600,00:04:53.960,My mum's glasses got broken.
00:04:54.040,00:04:57.800,I'm just off to buy her some new ones. See you later.
00:05:07.680,00:05:11.000,It's got protective spells to shield me from non-magical people.
00:05:14.920,00:05:17.200,-What? -I'm not magical.
00:05:18.640,00:05:20.200,But you can see me.
00:05:21.160,00:05:22.040,I know.
00:05:23.240,00:05:24.680,Who are you?
00:05:25.320,00:05:28.320,"I... I'm just, um... Mildred."
00:05:32.440,00:05:33.680,Maud Spellbody.
00:05:37.400,00:05:38.520,"Well met, sister."
00:05:42.400,00:05:43.520,Is that a witch thing?
00:05:48.600,00:05:51.080,"Oh, well, I can try again next year."
00:05:54.120,00:05:57.200,"Nope, you're going to get in this year!"
00:05:57.280,00:05:59.360,But I can't fly without my glasses.
00:05:59.440,00:06:00.760,You can if I help you.
00:06:01.320,00:06:03.840,-You mean you'll come with me? -Of course!
00:06:03.920,00:06:07.320,"Just let me text my mum, then you can show me how to fly this thing."
00:06:21.160,00:06:22.000,Go!
00:06:32.520,00:06:34.840,"Go, hop! Hop up!"
00:06:54.960,00:06:58.400,"-Yes, we did it! -Whoo-hoo!"
00:07:01.160,00:07:02.160,Look!
00:07:04.760,00:07:06.440,-What? -I can't see a thing!
00:07:06.520,00:07:08.320,-Which way are we going? -Left.
00:07:09.400,00:07:11.600,"Left, left, I said left!"
00:07:11.680,00:07:13.120,We are going left!
00:07:13.200,00:07:16.000,"Oh, OK, right! Go right!"
00:07:19.400,00:07:22.600,Whoa! Who-o-o-oa!
00:07:56.360,00:07:59.680,"Here they come, the future of witchcraft."
00:08:00.480,00:08:07.960,"The new term starts in six weeks, and these are our potential first formers?"
00:08:11.200,00:08:15.120,You said that last year. And the year before.
00:08:15.720,00:08:20.840,"Face it, Ada, the craft is in decline."
00:08:24.320,00:08:25.960,"What's up with you, HB?"
00:08:26.040,00:08:28.960,You look like you lost a cream cake and found a carrot.
00:08:29.400,00:08:35.960,"This school needs strong witches, not little girls who want to play at magic."
00:08:36.039,00:08:40.000,"We were all little girls once, Hecate. Even me!"
00:08:40.559,00:08:42.600,If you say so.
00:08:42.679,00:08:44.200,"Excuse me, Miss Hardbroom."
00:08:44.280,00:08:47.600,Lucinda has problems with allergies and can't do potions.
00:08:47.680,00:08:49.240,Who do I speak to about that?
00:08:49.320,00:08:52.560,"Somebody from another school, perhaps."
00:08:54.240,00:08:57.440,Health and safety is very important.
00:08:58.120,00:09:00.920,We can provide anti-allergy spells.
00:09:01.360,00:09:05.280,I truly despair for the future.
00:09:05.360,00:09:07.920,"They'll learn, we all did."
00:09:16.000,00:09:20.240,"Well, maybe there is some hope."
00:09:22.160,00:09:23.960,Good stick control.
00:09:30.640,00:09:32.840,"Uh, that's my sister, Ethel."
00:09:34.200,00:09:36.120,Ethel Hallow.
00:09:37.560,00:09:40.040,-Ethie. -Esme!
00:09:45.960,00:09:47.720,Welcome to our school.
00:09:48.360,00:09:50.400,"-Um, Ethel, this is-- -I know!"
00:09:51.840,00:09:53.800,"Well met, Miss Cackle, Miss Hardbroom."
00:09:54.360,00:09:55.240,Well met.
00:09:55.320,00:09:58.280,Two Hallows in one school.
00:09:59.280,00:10:02.160,You have a lot to live up to.
00:10:04.280,00:10:06.880,But there's no need to be intimidated.
00:10:06.960,00:10:09.840,No one expects you to be as clever as Esmeralda.
00:10:09.920,00:10:12.040,"-Uh, Miss Cackle-- -Don't be modest."
00:10:12.800,00:10:16.440,Esmeralda is the finest student this academy's ever had.
00:10:17.160,00:10:21.520,"If you're even half as crafty as your sister-- Look out, incoming!"
00:10:35.320,00:10:37.600,Maud! Maud!
00:10:44.880,00:10:48.040,I'll save you! I'm coming! Hold on!
00:10:57.320,00:10:58.520,Help!
00:10:59.080,00:11:03.560,Some believe a true witch will always float in water.
00:11:04.160,00:11:10.400,"Of course, a sensible witch would try to stand up... first."
00:11:24.920,00:11:26.920,I'm sorry to disturb you.
00:11:31.280,00:11:37.680,"Girl, stop bothering your intellectual superiors and get out."
00:12:00.360,00:12:02.600,She just magicked us dry.
00:12:04.080,00:12:05.040,Shh!
00:12:07.000,00:12:08.080,Well met.
00:12:10.880,00:12:12.040,Uh...
00:12:12.920,00:12:18.360,"I am Miss Hardbroom, deputy headmistress. And you are?"
00:12:21.080,00:12:23.400,"Oh, yes, I remember your mother."
00:12:24.600,00:12:26.800,Such a shame for her.
00:12:28.400,00:12:29.600,It was my fault.
00:12:31.520,00:12:34.720,And who are you?
00:12:37.840,00:12:40.360,Mildred. Mildred Hubble.
00:12:40.920,00:12:42.480,You're not on my list.
00:12:44.760,00:12:48.080,"No, 'cause she changed her mind."
00:12:48.160,00:12:50.040,She was down for Pentangle's.
00:12:50.920,00:12:56.480,"But Mum said this school was way better, so she should try here first."
00:12:56.560,00:12:58.320,Mum said it would be OK.
00:13:00.440,00:13:08.160,"Well, I suppose we should give you a chance to redeem yourself, Mildred Hubble."
00:13:19.440,00:13:22.240,"Mildred, Maud, this is Miss Cackle."
00:13:26.880,00:13:28.000,I'm over here.
00:13:29.520,00:13:32.080,"So sorry, I broke my glasses."
00:13:34.880,00:13:35.880,Let me see.
00:13:48.360,00:13:49.320,"Thank you, Miss Cackle."
00:13:50.120,00:13:52.600,Um... well met.
00:13:52.680,00:13:56.840,"Well met, Maud. Well met, Mildred."
00:13:58.040,00:13:59.120,Uh...
00:14:02.040,00:14:03.120,Well met.
00:14:03.960,00:14:05.560,"Are you all right, my dear?"
00:14:10.760,00:14:14.040,Leave her alone. She's... travel sick.
00:14:14.120,00:14:15.200,Pathetic.
00:14:16.600,00:14:20.160,"You've never been through a transference spell before, have you, dear?"
00:14:21.840,00:14:26.280,I'll tell you a secret: I did the same my first time.
00:14:27.760,00:14:31.160,"Here, take this."
00:14:31.920,00:14:35.200,-Is it magic? -Better. It's sugar.
00:14:35.640,00:14:38.440,I never go anywhere without a bag of lemon drops.
00:14:39.160,00:14:42.080,Suck on that and you'll be fine next time.
00:14:45.120,00:14:47.240,I'm not doing that... again.
00:14:47.320,00:14:49.080,"It gets easier, doesn't it?"
00:14:49.160,00:14:52.200,"OK, so I'm Esmeralda, I'm head of Year Three."
00:14:52.280,00:14:53.880,I thought all the girls were on holiday.
00:14:53.960,00:14:57.040,"I was, but I volunteered to help out Cackle and HB."
00:14:57.120,00:15:00.280,"-What's HB? -Uh, Miss Hardbroom, deputy head."
00:15:00.360,00:15:03.880,"You'll soon get to know all about her. Right, come on this way."
00:15:05.280,00:15:07.840,"Bit of a maze around here, but you'll soon get used to it."
00:15:07.920,00:15:11.240,The kitchen's in the basement. That's why the porridge is always so cold.
00:15:11.320,00:15:12.920,Why don't they just make food by magic?
00:15:13.520,00:15:15.480,A witch cannot live by magic alone.
00:15:15.560,00:15:20.640,"Witches' Code rule number 93, paragraph 6, clause A."
00:15:22.560,00:15:25.200,"Um, magical food's got no nutritional value."
00:15:25.280,00:15:27.920,It's a shame. It tastes a lot better than the slop they serve here.
00:15:28.640,00:15:30.880,I can't believe she doesn't know the basic rules.
00:15:30.960,00:15:32.840,Didn't your mother teach you anything?
00:15:32.920,00:15:35.280,Didn't your mother teach you not to be a bossy old toad?
00:15:45.520,00:15:48.280,So this is the potions lab.
00:15:52.920,00:15:55.720,The second-years were making invisibility elixirs last term.
00:16:10.800,00:16:12.440,Not enough slugs' eggs.
00:16:15.040,00:16:16.240,Right!
00:16:18.920,00:16:20.040,This way.
00:16:26.600,00:16:29.120,"-What's in there? -Oh, kitten room."
00:16:29.200,00:16:31.240,-Kittens! -Cats are assigned in Year One.
00:16:31.320,00:16:33.680,You work together with your cat all the way through the school.
00:16:34.240,00:16:36.160,We're not allowed pets in our flats.
00:16:37.240,00:16:39.680,A cat is not a pet.
00:16:39.760,00:16:43.640,"It's a familiar, an ancient tool of the craft."
00:16:44.200,00:16:45.320,Can we see the kittens?
00:16:45.400,00:16:48.520,"Um, maybe later. Your exam starts in ten minutes in the Great Hall."
00:16:49.080,00:16:50.080,This way.
00:16:52.600,00:16:56.400,"-Come on, Mildred. -I can't pass a witch exam. I'm not-- Shh!"
00:17:02.280,00:17:03.800,Let's talk in here.
00:17:16.680,00:17:19.640,"If you came here, you'd have a kitten of your own."
00:17:19.720,00:17:20.760,I wish I could.
00:17:21.400,00:17:23.720,But just wanting it doesn't make me a witch.
00:17:24.280,00:17:28.760,"You saw me on the broomstick, so you must have some magic in your family."
00:17:28.840,00:17:33.000,I really haven't. I never knew magic existed until today.
00:17:33.080,00:17:35.560,You've lived your whole life without magic?
00:17:36.120,00:17:38.440,"Yes, everyone does."
00:17:39.000,00:17:40.920,"Well, I thought they did."
00:17:43.920,00:17:46.080,"I mean, you're naturally crafty."
00:17:46.160,00:17:49.640,Didn't anything ever happen to you that you couldn't explain?
00:17:50.800,00:17:53.680,"Well, maybe."
00:17:53.760,00:17:56.760,You see? You should at least try the exam.
00:18:05.720,00:18:07.240,Did you shut the door?
00:18:09.360,00:18:10.760,We've lost a kitten!
00:18:12.600,00:18:14.280,"OK, let's think about this."
00:18:14.360,00:18:16.720,"You're a kitten, where would you go?"
00:18:17.920,00:18:19.240,-Where the food is. -The kitchen.
00:18:19.320,00:18:20.360,-That way. -That way.
00:18:45.400,00:18:48.000,Oi! No girls allowed in my kitchen.
00:18:48.080,00:18:51.120,-I'm sorry. -We were just-- Looking for a kitten.
00:18:56.040,00:18:57.920,"All right, you've got it. Now get out!"
00:19:03.400,00:19:04.760,Come on.
00:19:07.800,00:19:10.160,"Wow, Mildred, you're amazing with animals."
00:19:15.920,00:19:17.120,Miss Cackle.
00:19:23.200,00:19:24.960,What are you girls doing in here?
00:19:31.880,00:19:32.720,Agatha!
00:19:35.160,00:19:37.640,"Well met, sister."
00:19:37.720,00:19:39.960,"Well met, Agatha."
00:19:41.960,00:19:45.960,To what do we owe this unexpected surprise?
00:19:46.040,00:19:49.960,"I'm writing a piece about the school, for the Which Witching Academy website."
00:19:53.960,00:19:55.440,What are you doing in here?
00:19:55.520,00:19:57.360,These two girls were missing.
00:19:58.840,00:20:01.080,Miss Hardbroom wanted to disqualify you.
00:20:01.640,00:20:04.360,I had to use a finding spell to track you down.
00:20:13.440,00:20:15.640,"Now, get along to the exam room."
00:20:23.080,00:20:24.720,I'll see you in my office.
00:20:33.280,00:20:34.760,Finally.
00:20:35.640,00:20:38.160,You go there.
00:20:38.720,00:20:41.400,And you go there.
00:20:48.560,00:20:49.760,Begin.
00:21:21.680,00:21:23.200,"Are you all right, dear?"
00:21:25.440,00:21:29.520,"I always hated exams too, but here's a little tip."
00:21:30.400,00:21:34.160,Don't think about what's not in the old cauldron.
00:21:38.040,00:21:40.360,You mean focus on what I can do?
00:21:52.240,00:21:56.120,"Take charge, Hecate. I need to speak to my sister."
00:22:22.320,00:22:24.120,Just the usual stuff.
00:22:24.200,00:22:26.840,Twenty things you didn't know about Cackle's Academy.
00:22:26.920,00:22:29.200,"Number nine will shock you, et cetera."
00:22:30.000,00:22:36.760,"It's been five years, and you suddenly turn up on Selection Day of all days."
00:22:36.840,00:22:42.200,"I know you do your best, but you can't do it alone."
00:22:44.040,00:22:45.760,If we worked together...
00:22:47.000,00:22:49.200,"We tried that before, remember?"
00:22:49.560,00:22:51.280,I know we made mistakes.
00:22:53.560,00:22:58.200,"I made mistakes, but I've learned from them."
00:22:58.760,00:23:01.560,-I want to make it up to you. -How?
00:23:02.320,00:23:05.840,Let me tell the witching world about the great work you're doing here.
00:23:06.640,00:23:10.240,They'll realize that the future of the craft is in safe hands.
00:23:12.800,00:23:13.800,What do you need from me?
00:23:14.440,00:23:15.560,Let me interview the girls.
00:23:17.160,00:23:19.080,"All right, the teachers?"
00:23:20.920,00:23:22.960,You may speak to Miss Hardbroom.
00:23:28.680,00:23:29.720,"Well met, sister."
00:23:33.880,00:23:35.040,Well met.
00:23:58.840,00:24:01.360,"Time's up, girls. Pens down."
00:24:23.840,00:24:27.880,This is some variety of joke.
00:24:30.080,00:24:33.680,Miss Cackle said to focus on what I can do.
00:24:33.760,00:24:35.760,Art's my best subject.
00:24:37.880,00:24:45.600,"I'll give you one percent, and that is only because you spelled your own name correctly."
00:25:02.240,00:25:03.480,-Where are you going? -Home.
00:25:04.360,00:25:08.800,But the selection isn't over yet. There's still the practical test to come.
00:25:11.360,00:25:16.320,"Before we begin, Miss Hardbroom has the results of your written papers."
00:25:32.800,00:25:36.680,"However, there was one chink of light in the howling void."
00:25:36.760,00:25:39.400,A perfect 100 per...
00:25:40.800,00:25:42.680,cent.
00:25:45.240,00:25:49.880,"Ethel Hallow, you have equaled the school record."
00:25:51.240,00:25:52.560,Equaled?
00:25:52.640,00:25:57.040,Your sister also scored 100 percent in her written entrance exam.
00:25:57.120,00:26:01.040,And went on to score 98 percent in the practical.
00:26:02.040,00:26:03.800,Only 98?
00:26:04.360,00:26:07.520,One hundred percent? That-- that's amazing.
00:26:08.560,00:26:12.040,Not for a Hallow. It's just normal.
00:26:12.520,00:26:16.320,"Candidates, choose your spells."
00:26:23.280,00:26:26.280,Just pick an easy spell. Level One.
00:26:26.800,00:26:30.160,"You get more marks for the hard ones, but all we need to do is pass."
00:26:32.240,00:26:35.680,My hat! You're going for a Level Eight?
00:26:35.760,00:26:38.280,Only because Level Nine aren't allowed.
00:26:44.640,00:26:47.560,Why become a dragon if you don't breathe fire?
00:26:53.200,00:26:56.760,Basic Levitation.
00:26:57.480,00:27:02.560,"If on flying you've set your mind, then these ingredients you must find."
00:27:08.160,00:27:10.680,Flower of common cat trap.
00:27:17.160,00:27:19.360,Dried mandrake root.
00:27:22.760,00:27:23.760,Check.
00:27:25.000,00:27:26.880,Sliver of bee's brain.
00:27:35.200,00:27:36.080,Really?
00:27:48.440,00:27:52.760,I have never been interviewed for a website before.
00:27:52.840,00:27:54.480,"It's nothing to worry about, Hecate."
00:27:54.560,00:27:56.520,I'm not worried.
00:27:56.600,00:27:58.240,"Well, maybe you should be."
00:28:00.040,00:28:03.400,The craft is in a state of hurly-burly.
00:28:03.480,00:28:06.880,Fewer and fewer girls are inheriting magical abilities.
00:28:07.600,00:28:10.640,It must be tough trying to keep standards up.
00:28:16.400,00:28:20.000,My sister is very well-intentioned...
00:28:20.760,00:28:24.560,but perhaps if someone more forceful were in charge...
00:28:25.280,00:28:29.120,it might be easier to fight the tide of dumbing-down.
00:28:35.080,00:28:38.120,Slowly add the unicorn's milk.
00:28:40.960,00:28:43.320,Stir it till it's soft as silk.
00:28:54.280,00:28:56.200,"So, how's the brew going?"
00:28:56.280,00:28:58.000,It's supposed to turn blue.
00:29:29.240,00:29:31.760,"Breath of fire, hide of armor..."
00:29:31.840,00:29:34.160,"-Ethel, can I just-- -Not now."
00:29:35.280,00:29:37.840,"Give me strength, give me glamour."
00:29:38.600,00:29:44.920,"Teeth of diamond, gall of steel, force my enemies to kneel."
00:29:45.520,00:29:50.520,Let my bolts of flames be hurled and my power shall rule the world.
00:29:51.120,00:29:52.400,She's amazing!
00:29:55.720,00:29:57.680,"Five minutes, girls."
00:30:06.840,00:30:10.840,"-Mildred, did my potion work? -I don't know, what was it supposed to do?"
00:30:11.720,00:30:13.520,Make me taller! Whoa!
00:30:14.560,00:30:16.400,I think it worked!
00:30:18.120,00:30:19.320,Mine didn't!
00:30:20.520,00:30:21.880,Mildred.
00:30:23.840,00:30:25.840,It... It... It worked!
00:30:26.440,00:30:27.480,I'm flying!
00:30:28.120,00:30:30.240,"Well, floating."
00:30:31.520,00:30:33.080,-We did it! -We did it.
00:30:36.520,00:30:38.840,"All right, that's enough."
00:30:40.480,00:30:42.760,Not a bad effort.
00:30:55.320,00:30:58.960,"-Good luck, Ethie. -I won't need it."
00:31:07.240,00:31:11.040,It's happening! I can feel it.
00:31:12.840,00:31:14.440,Dragon fire in my belly.
00:31:15.120,00:31:16.520,Dragon blood in my veins.
00:31:17.080,00:31:20.080,I... I want to... I need to...
00:31:33.800,00:31:35.120,Miss Cackle.
00:31:38.480,00:31:41.640,"Oh, dear! I'm afraid it must be."
00:31:42.040,00:31:43.080,What is it?
00:31:43.160,00:31:45.640,Lumbricus terrestris.
00:31:46.280,00:31:51.000,A distant and rather vulgar relation of the noble dragon.
00:31:51.080,00:31:53.360,"Well, it's a common beginner's error."
00:31:53.760,00:31:55.840,"Let's get you back on your feet, shall we?"
00:32:06.600,00:32:10.280,Someone messed with my potion. I demand an inquiry.
00:32:12.400,00:32:17.120,"I've seen this many times before, and you simply didn't add enough pondweed."
00:32:18.720,00:32:21.240,I measured out the exact amount.
00:32:22.200,00:32:23.560,She's right.
00:32:24.960,00:32:26.280,It was me.
00:32:28.680,00:32:30.080,I did it.
00:32:37.200,00:32:40.360,"-No, it was a mistake. -She shouldn't even be here!"
00:32:40.960,00:32:43.280,She's not even from a witching family.
00:32:44.720,00:32:47.640,You lied to us.
00:32:47.720,00:32:56.480,"Not exactly, I-- Um... hi."
00:32:57.480,00:33:01.400,"I just wanted to say, please don't blame Mildred."
00:33:02.440,00:33:06.560,I told her to take the pondweed. It's all my fault.
00:33:09.120,00:33:11.920,"The point is, it wasn't my fault."
00:33:12.000,00:33:15.760,I'll do the test again. I'll get it right this time.
00:33:17.320,00:33:18.800,"Please, let me do it again."
00:33:19.640,00:33:22.880,"Sorry, Ethel, you really should have double-checked your ingredients."
00:33:22.960,00:33:25.600,A good witch leaves nothing to chance.
00:33:26.360,00:33:27.760,But don't worry.
00:33:27.840,00:33:32.720,"With your wonderful marks in the written exam, I'm sure you've scored enough to scrape a pass."
00:33:33.120,00:33:34.360,A pass?
00:33:34.880,00:33:39.680,"And you, you really have no craft in your family at all?"
00:33:39.760,00:33:42.080,"But my potion worked, I actually flew."
00:33:42.160,00:33:50.800,You interfered with another witch in the course of lawful spell casting in direct violation of the Witches' Code.
00:33:50.880,00:33:53.600,That's an automatic fail.
00:33:55.040,00:33:56.600,Nought percent.
00:33:57.760,00:33:59.760,Nought percent?
00:33:59.840,00:34:02.280,At least it makes your written result look good!
00:34:03.320,00:34:04.920,That's not fair!
00:34:05.920,00:34:10.280,Are you questioning the code?
00:34:12.120,00:34:12.960,Yes.
00:34:14.120,00:34:18.960,"Mildred's family may not be magical, but she is."
00:34:20.239,00:34:22.880,You can't turn her down just because of one mistake.
00:34:22.960,00:34:27.840,"I know it seems harsh, but witches work with the fundamental forces of nature."
00:34:27.920,00:34:31.120,Our magic must be used with utmost caution.
00:34:32.120,00:34:35.679,I'm afraid that a real witch would know that.
00:34:42.000,00:34:45.840,Congratulations to our new first-years.
00:34:45.920,00:34:48.320,You've all done splendidly.
00:34:49.160,00:34:52.880,I shall see you all later for our celebratory feast.
00:34:54.280,00:34:57.320,Failed applicants this way.
00:34:57.400,00:35:00.600,Your parents and guardians will collect you.
00:35:19.120,00:35:21.200,I just wish you were coming too.
00:35:22.320,00:35:25.560,"-I've really let you down. -No, you didn't."
00:35:28.240,00:35:33.280,Mildred Hubble... are you still here?
00:35:34.880,00:35:37.920,"I was just leaving, Miss Hardbroom."
00:36:26.800,00:36:28.120,"-Are you all right, dear? -Huh?"
00:36:28.200,00:36:33.320,I'm sorry! It's just I'm not really very good with the dark.
00:36:33.400,00:36:36.200,A witch who's afraid of the dark?
00:36:37.920,00:36:39.480,I'm not a witch.
00:36:40.920,00:36:44.800,"I made a fool of myself in front of everyone, twice."
00:36:44.880,00:36:46.480,My poor dear.
00:36:47.440,00:36:50.240,How dreadfully humiliating for you.
00:36:50.320,00:36:53.160,You must be so disappointed.
00:36:54.120,00:36:56.040,But that's not the worst of it.
00:36:57.120,00:37:03.600,You didn't just let yourself down. You hurt everyone who cares about you.
00:37:03.680,00:37:05.560,Maud really wanted me to get in.
00:37:07.160,00:37:11.240,"There, there. She'll get over it."
00:37:11.840,00:37:18.280,"She'll make lots of other friends, good friends who won't fail her like you did."
00:37:20.240,00:37:23.600,"Oh, there, there."
00:37:24.160,00:37:28.360,It's all right. Let it all out.
00:37:31.920,00:37:35.040,"-Feeling better? -Not really, no."
00:37:36.400,00:37:38.160,"Can I have a lemon drop, please?"
00:37:39.440,00:37:40.720,Lemon drop?
00:37:43.360,00:38:01.920,"But. But I-- Miss Tapioca, the successful candidates are ready for the feast."
00:38:02.680,00:38:04.160,"Yes, Miss Cackle."
00:38:07.560,00:38:09.280,-Do you mind if I...? -Oh.
00:38:16.680,00:38:20.240,"-Mm, it's delicious. -Thank you, Miss Cackle."
00:38:20.320,00:38:24.640,It just needs a teeny-tiny bit more ground snail shell to make it even more yummy.
00:38:24.720,00:38:27.360,I've been using this recipe for 30 years.
00:38:27.440,00:38:29.400,Who's headmistress?
00:38:49.840,00:38:51.040,That's better.
00:38:55.840,00:39:01.000,"Before the clock doth strike the hour, this school shall be within my power."
00:39:03.320,00:39:07.200,Nettles picked by full moon's beam...
00:39:09.000,00:39:13.560,scum skimmed from a stagnant stream.
00:39:14.680,00:39:16.360,Mandrake root...
00:39:22.600,00:39:23.880,And...
00:39:24.880,00:39:28.280,tears of a young witch...
00:39:29.040,00:39:32.720,who lost her dream.
00:39:38.560,00:39:40.960,We have never been a fee-paying school.
00:39:41.600,00:39:45.440,We believe that every witch deserves a free education.
00:39:45.520,00:39:46.560,Miss Cackle!
00:39:49.480,00:39:50.920,Miss Cackle is speaking!
00:39:52.080,00:39:55.720,"Maintaining our high standards-- -Please, you have to listen! -Not now!"
00:39:55.800,00:39:57.480,"Yes now, you're all in danger."
00:39:58.160,00:40:00.440,"Mildred, what's wrong?"
00:40:03.360,00:40:05.720,"As for you, I've had quite enough of your lies."
00:40:05.800,00:40:08.080,-But it's true! -Time to leave.
00:40:10.160,00:40:11.360,"But, Agatha..."
00:40:14.520,00:40:17.960,Miss Cackle! Miss Hardbroom! Maud!
00:40:20.080,00:40:22.760,Miss Hardbroom! Miss Cackle! Maud!
00:40:25.120,00:40:29.120,of passing on our high standards to the next generation.
00:40:57.920,00:41:00.080,They're just a bunch of evil old witches.
00:41:03.840,00:41:06.160,Not like there's anything I can do anyway.
00:41:13.360,00:41:18.960,The common cat trap flower... from the levitation spell.
00:41:22.880,00:41:24.480,But I can't do magic.
00:41:27.880,00:41:30.720,And we don't even have a cauldron.
00:41:40.240,00:41:42.960,upon this site of ancient power.
00:41:44.040,00:41:51.800,The school itself was formally founded in the dark centuries before the coming of Arthur.
00:41:52.600,00:41:58.360,"And now, you yourselves will become part of the history of the craft."
00:41:58.920,00:42:17.960,"Nobody may eat as your mothers and grandmothers did before you, not to mention your great-grandmothers and your great-great-grandmothers."
00:42:23.040,00:42:26.960,we respect the past and the present of witchcraft.
00:42:27.840,00:42:32.600,But I've rambled on quite enough. Time to enjoy our Selection Day feast.
00:44:25.680,00:44:29.440,No! Don't eat the soup!
00:44:33.080,00:44:35.560,"I had to warn you, she put a spell on the soup."
00:44:39.920,00:44:41.040,Why?
00:44:42.040,00:44:44.720,Because I should be headmistress here.
00:44:45.880,00:44:47.800,You know it makes sense.
00:44:47.880,00:44:50.000,If you want this school to be great again...
00:44:50.640,00:44:53.760,stand up and follow me.
00:44:55.120,00:44:57.320,-Agatha is our leader. -Miss Drill!
00:44:57.400,00:45:00.040,She's the greatest witch who ever lived.
00:45:00.120,00:45:05.160,She is under the influence of a total-obedience spell.
00:45:06.240,00:45:08.480,"Oh, a very powerful one, too."
00:45:08.560,00:45:11.880,Which means she'll be loyal to the first person who gave her orders.
00:45:12.720,00:45:14.800,Who did this? How did this happen?
00:45:15.280,00:45:18.400,"Because she tried the soup, just like Mildred said."
00:45:18.920,00:45:23.640,I invoke Section Seven of the Witches' Code.
00:45:23.720,00:45:26.880,"Yes, I thought you might."
00:45:34.760,00:45:37.520,"To me, girls! I'll teach you a protective charm."
00:45:43.640,00:45:47.880,A magical duel between witches. The loser will forfeit their powers.
00:45:47.960,00:45:50.800,"Oh, dear! Come on now, come on, come on!"
00:46:08.800,00:46:12.040,"I really don't want to have to hurt you, Agatha."
00:46:13.600,00:46:14.680,And you won't...
00:46:15.560,00:46:19.640,because you're my sister and you're weak.
00:46:24.720,00:46:28.800,Don't confuse kindness with weakness.
00:46:32.240,00:46:35.440,"Mildred Hubble, come here, you wretched girl."
00:46:38.720,00:46:39.960,This is really bad.
00:46:40.040,00:46:42.720,You're all perfectly safe so long as you do as you're told.
00:46:44.360,00:46:45.320,Carry on!
00:46:47.800,00:46:49.640,You've always been weak.
00:46:49.720,00:46:53.000,Mother only gave you this school because you're 13 minutes older.
00:46:53.080,00:46:57.120,Those 13 minutes have saved this school from disaster.
00:47:04.480,00:47:07.280,"We can do this all day if you like, Agatha."
00:47:28.320,00:47:30.240,"Had enough yet, sister?"
00:47:34.280,00:47:35.760,Agatha wins.
00:47:35.840,00:47:38.000,All hail Agatha.
00:47:38.080,00:47:40.840,-Help her! -The code forbids it.
00:47:41.600,00:47:46.400,-Prepare to be mollusked. -She's turning her into a snail.
00:47:47.640,00:47:48.960,-Fascinating! -No.
00:47:49.040,00:47:50.800,-Mildred! -Mildred Hubble.
00:47:51.520,00:47:53.440,"Please, don't hurt her."
00:47:55.320,00:47:58.720,This is all my fault. I'm sorry I spoiled your plans.
00:48:02.280,00:48:03.680,"That's all right, dear!"
00:48:04.960,00:48:08.560,You've just put them right back on track.
00:48:10.800,00:48:15.280,"Ada, it's you or this girl. One of you is leaving here in a shell."
00:48:15.520,00:48:20.280,-Don't make me choose both. -Let Mildred go.
00:48:20.360,00:48:22.440,You know my price: the school.
00:48:24.200,00:48:30.120,Yes. Free her and I will lower my protective spells.
00:48:30.200,00:48:32.360,You have protective spells?
00:48:32.440,00:48:34.440,"Of course she did, you foolish girl."
00:48:39.000,00:48:41.360,So you weren't about to lose the duel.
00:48:43.640,00:48:44.800,"No, Mildred."
00:48:50.120,00:48:53.120,Stay back or the girl gets it.
00:48:53.200,00:48:57.280,"Release the child, and then you may do as you will with me."
00:48:57.360,00:49:00.000,-No! -How do I know I can trust you?
00:49:00.720,00:49:04.240,I swear by the Witches' Code.
00:49:07.200,00:49:09.760,"All right, go."
00:49:09.840,00:49:11.240,"Go, Mildred."
00:49:14.920,00:49:18.600,"Who's on the naughty step now, big sis?"
00:49:40.120,00:49:43.800,The school is mine!
00:49:50.560,00:49:57.040,"May I be the first to offer my congratulations, Headmistress?"
00:49:58.400,00:50:02.680,Hecate Hardbroom! After all Ada did for you.
00:50:02.760,00:50:07.240,"She was a satisfactory headmistress, but you were right."
00:50:07.320,00:50:11.000,We need a forceful leader to promote higher standards.
00:50:11.080,00:50:12.400,Miss Cackle was strong.
00:50:12.480,00:50:15.160,"Not strong enough, it seems."
00:50:15.240,00:50:18.680,-She only lost because of me. -And Agatha's really evil.
00:50:18.760,00:50:21.200,That is not for us to judge.
00:50:21.280,00:50:25.880,No witch may interfere in a Section Seven duel.
00:50:25.960,00:50:28.720,For once accepted to this school...
00:50:29.520,00:50:33.600,you are all bound by the Witches' Code.
00:50:33.680,00:50:37.200,"Miss Hardbroom, I knew I could depend on you."
00:50:37.760,00:50:43.280,No member of staff or any pupil will raise their hand against you.
00:50:43.960,00:50:49.960,We are all bound by the Witches' Code.
00:51:01.840,00:51:07.920,"Perhaps, Agatha, you would like to take possession of the keys to your school."
00:51:08.000,00:51:12.960,"Keys to my school, at last!"
00:51:27.920,00:51:29.440,Now get her. Come on!
00:51:29.520,00:51:31.600,We can't! It's against the code!
00:51:31.680,00:51:34.600,"We have to stop her! Somebody help me, please!"
00:51:41.520,00:51:46.600,"I'll help you, Mistress Mildred. What should I do?"
00:51:47.880,00:51:48.720,What?
00:51:48.800,00:51:52.280,"The total-obedience spell. Quick, give her orders."
00:51:53.520,00:51:57.760,"Um, I order you to lose the duel and turn that snail back into Miss Cackle."
00:51:57.840,00:51:59.920,I obey.
00:52:08.360,00:52:09.240,Ada.
00:52:12.040,00:52:14.880,"It's all right, Hecate. I'm fine."
00:52:15.560,00:52:16.520,Of course you are.
00:52:18.880,00:52:21.840,"Thank you, Mildred. That was very clever."
00:52:24.320,00:52:27.160,It was the perfect way to deal with Agatha.
00:52:27.240,00:52:29.880,Agatha! Agatha is our leader.
00:52:30.440,00:52:32.600,"Oh, do stop doing that!"
00:52:33.560,00:52:34.760,"Sorry, everyone!"
00:52:35.760,00:52:36.920,A bit embarrassing.
00:52:41.760,00:52:43.680,So what will happen to Agatha?
00:52:44.320,00:52:47.320,I've confiscated her magical knowledge and ability.
00:52:48.080,00:52:52.720,"As for you, I think we should summon your parent or guardian."
00:52:58.000,00:52:58.840,Mum.
00:53:03.680,00:53:05.480,I was just cleaning the toilet!
00:53:09.880,00:53:11.040,Uh...
00:53:13.280,00:53:19.640,"Agatha Cackle, you were always a bad girl, but this time you've gone too far."
00:53:19.720,00:53:22.800,I was trying to save this school from mediocrity.
00:53:22.880,00:53:24.360,It's time to go home.
00:53:25.840,00:53:26.840,Home?
00:53:26.920,00:53:29.280,Your mother is coming to collect you.
00:53:30.040,00:53:32.080,I don't think so!
00:53:43.720,00:53:44.840,My powers!
00:53:49.600,00:53:51.560,Magic is real?
00:53:52.560,00:53:53.680,That is correct.
00:53:56.920,00:53:59.680,"I can't... No, I just can't..."
00:53:59.760,00:54:00.760,"It's OK, Mum."
00:54:00.840,00:54:04.000,"If you need more proof, I'll happily turn you into a pumpkin."
00:54:04.760,00:54:05.920,Hecate!
00:54:07.440,00:54:14.080,So you're magic and all the teachers are magic and the girls learn magic?
00:54:14.160,00:54:18.440,"I see where Mildred gets her quick wits, Mistress Hubble."
00:54:18.520,00:54:21.480,All right... Mrs. I'm So Magical.
00:54:21.560,00:54:24.840,"If you're so much better than me, how about conjuring up some manners?"
00:54:26.640,00:54:28.520,And it's Ms. Hubble.
00:54:30.800,00:54:33.760,Did you even realize that Mildred had applied for a place here?
00:54:34.600,00:54:38.080,"No, I had no idea."
00:54:40.560,00:54:42.520,"Could we talk in private, please?"
00:54:43.160,00:54:44.480,Of course.
00:54:51.680,00:54:54.960,How could you do this without even asking?
00:54:55.600,00:54:57.720,"Well, I... I didn't mean to."
00:54:57.800,00:55:00.120,It... It just sort of happened.
00:55:00.800,00:55:04.200,St. Joseph's is just down the road. They've got a big new computer lab.
00:55:04.280,00:55:07.840,"Yeah, but they haven't got magic... or Maud."
00:55:09.480,00:55:13.080,But how would you get here every day? There's no buses up the mountain.
00:55:14.040,00:55:17.320,"Uh... Um, no..."
00:55:19.440,00:55:21.240,It's a boarding school.
00:55:21.920,00:55:23.440,So you'd stay here?
00:55:23.520,00:55:25.280,Only in term times.
00:55:28.360,00:55:31.320,"-Oh! -I'm... I'm sorry, Mum."
00:55:31.400,00:55:33.000,This was a stupid idea.
00:55:33.800,00:55:37.760,"I'll come home, I'll go to St. Joseph's, whatever you want."
00:55:41.680,00:55:44.120,All I want is for you to be happy.
00:55:45.680,00:55:47.640,Do you think you'd be happy coming here?
00:55:49.000,00:55:51.160,"I don't know, but..."
00:55:54.160,00:55:55.920,If they'll let you?
00:55:56.400,00:55:58.520,You saved their whole school.
00:55:59.680,00:56:01.200,"I did, didn't I?"
00:56:01.280,00:56:05.280,Absolutely. Don't you forget it. They're lucky to have you.
00:56:07.640,00:56:08.840,So am I.
00:56:13.840,00:56:14.840,Oh!
00:56:23.280,00:56:24.920,I bet they're gonna let her in!
00:56:25.000,00:56:30.040,"-Bats. If they do, I'm dropping out. -Can we get that in writing?"
00:56:35.920,00:56:38.960,So... what did they say?
00:56:40.840,00:56:42.120,I'm in!
00:56:42.200,00:56:43.880,Yay!
00:56:44.320,00:56:46.080,But just on a trial basis.
00:56:46.160,00:56:48.520,I wouldn't bother getting too friendly.
00:56:48.600,00:56:51.200,I've a feeling that this is going to be a very short trial.
00:56:54.600,00:56:55.840,"Come on, Millie!"
00:57:02.080,00:57:05.400,"Prospectus, reading list, uniform requirements."
00:57:05.480,00:57:09.160,"Right, um... Ooh, what a lot of black."
00:57:09.240,00:57:12.240,Witches don't really do pink. Shall I transport you home?
00:57:12.320,00:57:13.200,Yes.
00:57:13.280,00:57:26.200,"Oh, no, wait. No, but-- Still got a good feeling about this year?"
00:00:50.240,00:00:52.760,Exactly one centimeter taller.
00:00:55.840,00:00:57.840,"Well done, Felicity."
00:00:57.920,00:01:01.320,"Now, Mildred... Hubble?"
00:01:07.240,00:01:10.720,And that's another mock exam you've failed.
00:01:21.200,00:01:24.080,"Don't look so smug, Ethel."
00:01:29.080,00:01:32.240,Ninety-six? How?
00:01:33.120,00:01:40.040,"You failed to focus, probably because of your increasingly ridiculous feud with Mildred Hubble."
00:01:41.440,00:01:46.080,"Listen, girls, you cannot afford any distractions."
00:01:46.160,00:01:49.960,You have one week until the real end-of-term exams.
00:01:50.040,00:01:52.720,And anyone who fails those...
00:01:53.280,00:01:57.160,will be out... for good.
00:02:02.160,00:02:04.560,"Don't worry, I'm sure you'll do better in the real exams."
00:02:04.640,00:02:10.199,How? I'm 11 years behind the rest of you. I'll never catch up.
00:02:10.280,00:02:13.920,"Yes, you will. I made you a revision timetable."
00:02:15.720,00:02:16.920,Thanks.
00:02:17.960,00:02:20.640,Meet me in my room in ten minutes.
00:03:07.000,00:03:09.760,"Thank you, Nightstar. Good cat."
00:03:09.880,00:03:12.520,I set her to keep watch outside Miss Cackle's office.
00:03:12.600,00:03:13.680,What for?
00:03:14.600,00:03:15.600,Mildred Hubble.
00:03:15.680,00:03:18.200,She's been having private meetings with Miss Cackle.
00:03:19.920,00:03:23.080,-I bet you it's about the secret scroll. -What secret scroll?
00:03:23.160,00:03:25.600,"I don't know, it's a secret."
00:03:26.360,00:03:29.920,But Mildred knows. And we're going to find out.
00:03:30.680,00:03:33.600,If it became known that Agatha is the elder twin...
00:03:34.480,00:03:36.360,I would have to give up the school to her.
00:03:40.160,00:03:42.800,That seems a bit... silly.
00:03:44.120,00:03:50.200,"Maybe to you, but the Witches' Code is very strict on the subject of inheritance."
00:03:54.280,00:03:58.160,"As it turns out, I've been breaking it all of my life."
00:03:59.320,00:04:02.160,I would never have chosen to cheat my sister.
00:04:03.560,00:04:06.240,But now I know what she's capable of.
00:04:06.960,00:04:09.240,"-You can't tell her. -No, I can't."
00:04:09.680,00:04:12.720,This knowledge could endanger the entire school.
00:04:13.440,00:04:17.640,"And you cannot tell anyone, not even your best friends."
00:04:18.440,00:04:21.120,-Promise me. -I promise.
00:04:34.360,00:04:35.280,Hi.
00:04:40.360,00:04:41.360,What's wrong?
00:04:42.960,00:04:45.840,Uh... You were supposed to revise together.
00:04:47.080,00:04:50.480,"Oh, right, sorry. I forgot."
00:04:50.560,00:04:54.160,I know it's boring... but I was only trying to help you.
00:04:57.520,00:04:58.600,Where were you?
00:04:59.600,00:05:00.600,With Miss Cackle.
00:05:04.080,00:05:06.080,"Oh, you know, it's just 'cause I failed my mocks."
00:05:11.400,00:05:12.280,Maud.
00:05:16.800,00:05:17.840,Can you help me?
00:05:20.240,00:05:23.800,No time for that. We've got work to do.
00:05:27.360,00:05:29.120,"Be very careful, Ada."
00:05:29.200,00:05:32.720,Show Agatha pity and she will take advantage.
00:05:32.800,00:05:35.680,I know... but I must see her.
00:05:36.200,00:05:38.560,"-At least let me come with you. -No, Hecate."
00:05:38.640,00:05:42.280,I need you here... in case anything happens.
00:05:46.280,00:05:48.680,Powdered chameleon skin.
00:05:51.880,00:05:53.160,Parrot's tongue.
00:05:53.560,00:05:55.360,Those are restricted ingredients.
00:05:55.880,00:05:57.720,Do you want to find out about this secret or not?
00:05:57.800,00:05:59.440,I want whatever you want.
00:06:10.920,00:06:14.280,"-Look, I'm revising. -I can see that."
00:06:16.760,00:06:17.880,I want to talk.
00:06:22.360,00:06:24.800,I don't think it's fair that you are keeping secrets from me.
00:06:26.240,00:06:27.600,I'm not. I'm not.
00:06:27.680,00:06:29.480,"That is a lie, Mildred Hubble."
00:06:32.480,00:06:34.360,Naughty Tabby.
00:06:36.160,00:06:38.920,Tell me what's going on or this friendship is over.
00:06:45.960,00:06:46.880,Hi.
00:06:47.920,00:06:52.960,"-Don't you ever knock? -Nice to see you too, Maud."
00:06:54.960,00:06:58.280,I'll meet you by the broomstick shed in five minutes.
00:06:58.360,00:07:01.160,"Um... Yeah, OK."
00:07:10.960,00:07:14.320,"That's it! Tabby, you're a genius."
00:07:16.200,00:07:20.720,"So Tabby just tried to scratch Maud, except he'd never do that."
00:07:20.800,00:07:23.120,So maybe that wasn't Maud.
00:07:23.800,00:07:27.120,-I know who it was. -Ethel Hallow?
00:07:27.800,00:07:29.800,She's really crossed the line this time.
00:07:29.880,00:07:31.360,"No, wait."
00:07:34.320,00:07:37.320,Don't you want to have some fun... first?
00:08:36.240,00:08:37.799,"Hello, Agatha?"
00:08:45.640,00:08:46.720,Agatha?
00:08:47.240,00:08:48.800,Are you in here?
00:08:50.080,00:08:53.240,"I don't think best friends should have secrets, do you?"
00:08:54.240,00:08:55.320,No.
00:08:56.840,00:08:58.720,"OK, I'll tell you."
00:09:06.720,00:09:08.320,A very magical family.
00:09:09.120,00:09:12.360,"In fact, I'm Miss Cackle's niece."
00:09:12.960,00:09:14.680,-What? -Yes.
00:09:15.760,00:09:19.440,Auntie Ada didn't want people to think she was giving special treatment to me.
00:09:19.960,00:09:21.920,So we decided to keep it a secret.
00:09:22.000,00:09:25.280,"-Does Miss Hardbroom know about this? -Oh, yeah."
00:09:25.360,00:09:28.040,"Um, she even pretends to be extra mean to me..."
00:09:28.800,00:09:30.000,just to make it look good.
00:09:31.320,00:09:33.800,"I can trust you, can't I?"
00:09:34.200,00:09:35.400,You won't tell anyone?
00:09:35.880,00:09:39.680,Of course. Your secret's safe with me.
00:09:50.080,00:09:51.280,That's better.
00:09:53.920,00:09:55.520,It all makes sense now.
00:10:01.640,00:10:03.240,I have to put this right.
00:10:06.160,00:10:08.400,-She's gone? -Yes.
00:10:08.840,00:10:13.760,"Somehow, Agatha managed to escape the enchantments that bound her to Darkwood Cottage."
00:10:13.840,00:10:17.000,But how? She's got no magical powers.
00:10:17.080,00:10:19.200,Then another witch must have helped her.
00:10:19.280,00:10:23.560,But her punishment was decreed by the Great Wizard himself.
00:10:23.640,00:10:26.680,The code absolutely forbids it.
00:10:26.960,00:10:32.080,"Clearly, Agatha has friends who are willing to break the code for her."
00:10:36.680,00:10:42.200,"Your Greatness, I have some rather worrying news."
00:11:00.360,00:11:06.280,"The Great Wizard will be here tomorrow, but until Agatha is caught, we must take extra precautions."
00:11:06.680,00:11:10.720,I have placed protective spells on the school buildings.
00:11:11.320,00:11:18.920,No outsider will be able to enter unless they are explicitly invited in by one of the staff...
00:11:20.360,00:11:21.840,or pupils.
00:11:23.560,00:11:33.840,"Furthermore, any girl who leaves school grounds without permission will be instantly expelled."
00:11:40.560,00:11:44.040,"Now, get on with your work."
00:11:47.560,00:11:49.280,"Millie, over here."
00:11:55.760,00:12:01.920,"I know you have trouble with your exams, so I made you a studying syrup to help you concentrate."
00:12:02.520,00:12:04.960,Why did you do that? You don't even like her.
00:12:05.320,00:12:06.960,I want to be your best friend.
00:12:12.600,00:12:13.760,Don't touch that.
00:12:13.840,00:12:15.160,Please just try it.
00:12:15.240,00:12:17.120,Leave her alone!
00:12:29.560,00:12:32.480,Using unauthorized spells again.
00:12:33.920,00:12:36.400,What is in this mixture really?
00:12:41.960,00:12:43.520,Totally harmless.
00:12:44.200,00:12:47.560,I just wanted to be better friends with your niece.
00:12:51.760,00:12:54.840,I never really believed the whole worst witch thing anyway.
00:12:58.200,00:12:59.040,Yes.
00:13:01.160,00:13:04.160,"But I told Maud, but it wasn't really Maud."
00:13:04.240,00:13:06.760,It was Ethel pretending to be Maud.
00:13:06.840,00:13:10.200,More unauthorized magic.
00:13:10.280,00:13:12.240,"Well, yeah, but..."
00:13:18.880,00:13:22.400,"Mildred, I thought I could depend on you."
00:13:23.040,00:13:24.720,"You can, I promise."
00:13:25.800,00:13:27.360,I didn't mean to.
00:13:28.040,00:13:30.400,I just didn't think.
00:13:31.640,00:13:35.400,"That's your problem, isn't it? You never do think."
00:13:35.920,00:13:39.640,"But you must learn, Mildred Hubble. You will learn."
00:13:40.920,00:13:46.160,"Until the end of term, you are both confined to your rooms during all free periods."
00:13:49.320,00:13:54.520,This foolishness must stop before you bring great harm to this academy.
00:14:01.080,00:14:02.960,I've never seen Miss Cackle like that.
00:14:05.840,00:14:07.440,What if that isn't Miss Cackle?
00:14:08.720,00:14:11.360,What if Agatha came back from Darkwood Cottage instead?
00:14:11.800,00:14:13.320,This school is all she's ever wanted.
00:14:15.680,00:14:16.680,We have to warn everyone.
00:14:17.120,00:14:20.640,Calm down. We have no evidence that that's Agatha.
00:14:29.320,00:14:31.560,But we've all known Ada for years.
00:14:31.640,00:14:34.520,"Yes, someone would have noticed."
00:14:34.600,00:14:37.720,-They didn't last time. -That's true.
00:14:38.680,00:14:40.040,So what do we do?
00:14:54.120,00:14:55.160,"What is it, dear?"
00:14:57.800,00:15:00.840,He's turned into a frog again.
00:15:03.360,00:15:06.360,"Well, it's hardly surprising after 30 years in amphibian form."
00:15:11.080,00:15:14.040,You've been practicing reversal spells for your exams.
00:15:14.720,00:15:15.720,Why don't you help him?
00:15:17.040,00:15:21.040,"I tried, but my magic isn't strong enough."
00:15:22.040,00:15:23.520,How disappointing.
00:15:25.760,00:15:28.960,So... will you help him?
00:15:29.040,00:15:30.200,Who?
00:15:34.120,00:15:36.680,"Oh, Mr. Rowan Webb. Of course."
00:15:42.600,00:15:44.120,"Hmm! Thanks, Ada."
00:15:45.520,00:15:47.680,Hmm! It's a bit embarrassing.
00:15:53.120,00:15:54.960,You really must be more careful.
00:16:05.600,00:16:07.120,Shall I test you on your witch maps?
00:16:07.200,00:16:10.080,"Look, I just can't think about exams at a time like this."
00:16:11.320,00:16:16.800,"If Agatha really has taken Miss Cackle's place, then why hasn't Miss Cackle come back to stop her?"
00:16:20.920,00:16:22.600,Agatha must have trapped her somewhere.
00:16:24.280,00:16:25.360,In the cottage.
00:16:28.080,00:16:29.640,Darkwood isn't too far away.
00:16:30.200,00:16:31.920,We could get there by broomstick in an hour.
00:16:33.040,00:16:36.080,"No, you heard what HB said."
00:16:36.160,00:16:38.400,"If we leave the school, we'll be expelled."
00:16:38.480,00:16:40.000,We'll never see each other again.
00:16:40.080,00:16:42.720,-Maybe we need to take a chance. -Really?
00:16:44.160,00:16:45.800,That's how much you care about me?
00:16:45.880,00:16:48.440,I do. You're my best friend. But the whole school's in danger.
00:16:50.040,00:16:53.040,You're about to fail your exams and get chucked out.
00:16:56.360,00:17:04.079,If I really am your best friend-- Stay here and do some revision.
00:17:15.440,00:17:17.760,I bet you were straight on the mirror to Mum.
00:17:17.839,00:17:20.960,Guess what Ethel's done this time! She's such a rubbish daughter.
00:17:21.880,00:17:24.119,Lucky I'm so perfect in every way.
00:17:24.200,00:17:27.240,"Don't have a go at me, I'm only trying to help."
00:17:27.319,00:17:30.800,I don't want your help! It's bad enough always being second best.
00:17:30.880,00:17:32.760,"If you are, you only have yourself to blame."
00:17:32.840,00:17:37.440,The older sister gets everything. Those are the rules. How is that my fault?
00:17:37.520,00:17:41.720,"It's not, but, Ethel, it's your life. Only you can change it."
00:17:42.880,00:17:46.720,You're right. I have to do this.
00:17:47.480,00:17:48.400,Now.
00:19:16.840,00:19:18.000,Miss Cackle?
00:19:19.560,00:19:24.600,"Mildred Hubble, is that you? I can't see you without my glasses."
00:19:24.680,00:19:26.560,"It's me, Miss Cackle."
00:19:31.240,00:19:35.240,Agatha's taken over the school but everyone thinks she's you and she's got her powers back.
00:19:35.320,00:19:39.120,I know. She took mine when she imprisoned me here.
00:19:44.640,00:19:47.360,But it would involve a great sacrifice.
00:19:48.000,00:19:49.280,What do you mean?
00:19:49.360,00:19:54.280,"I know you, Mildred. You will do anything to help your friends."
00:19:56.320,00:19:58.400,You want me to give you my powers?
00:19:58.960,00:20:01.720,"I'm so sorry, dear. It's the only way."
00:20:04.000,00:20:07.240,But it must be your own free will.
00:20:15.280,00:20:16.520,Take my hand.
00:20:18.320,00:20:19.640,Repeat after me.
00:20:20.520,00:20:24.520,"-I, Mildred Hubble... -I, Mildred Hubble..."
00:20:24.600,00:20:29.320,-...freely gift my witch's powers... -...freely gift my witch's powers...
00:20:29.400,00:20:32.120,...to the one with whom I stand.
00:20:34.320,00:20:36.160,"-To Ada Cackle. -No, dear."
00:20:40.480,00:20:41.600,Why?
00:20:42.280,00:20:45.160,It's a very high-level magic thing. You wouldn't understand.
00:20:45.240,00:20:46.520,I do. You're Agatha.
00:21:00.680,00:21:03.080,-Miss Gullet. -Tut-tut.
00:21:03.160,00:21:05.400,No working safety spells.
00:21:06.000,00:21:09.640,No cat. And now this.
00:21:09.720,00:21:11.600,What a shambles.
00:21:11.680,00:21:15.040,It's completely unsafe.
00:21:16.040,00:21:16.880,No!
00:21:19.720,00:21:20.760,Grab her!
00:21:25.200,00:21:27.720,Help! Somebody!
00:21:27.800,00:21:30.320,"Witches don't beg for help, witches help themselves."
00:21:34.040,00:21:37.520,"By root, branch, and tree, let me flee."
00:21:39.680,00:21:40.840,Come on.
00:21:46.400,00:21:48.920,Bats! A clumsiness curse.
00:21:49.000,00:21:51.400,I didn't know the little slug had it in her.
00:21:51.480,00:21:54.480,"We'll deal with her later, if she ever gets out of the woods."
00:21:54.560,00:21:57.800,"For now, we've got bigger cauldrons to boil."
00:21:57.880,00:21:59.360,It's time I got my powers back.
00:21:59.440,00:22:03.960,"I've already told you, we'll do anything to get our revenge, won't we, Flappy?"
00:22:04.040,00:22:05.640,Except that.
00:22:05.720,00:22:08.760,I know. You gave me my freedom and that's enough.
00:22:09.880,00:22:13.400,But Mildred's not the only gullible child at the academy.
00:22:57.400,00:22:58.400,Ethel.
00:23:01.720,00:23:03.160,Of course you followed me.
00:23:03.240,00:23:05.440,To stop you doing something foolish.
00:23:06.560,00:23:09.520,-What are you doing? -The scroll.
00:23:15.560,00:23:18.040,What is lost must now be found.
00:23:18.120,00:23:20.640,Let the secret be unbound.
00:23:27.760,00:23:29.000,What's that?
00:23:34.640,00:23:35.920,They lied to her.
00:23:36.680,00:23:38.320,All her life.
00:23:38.400,00:23:40.440,What? Let me see.
00:23:54.000,00:23:55.640,"Miss Gullet, what are you doing here?"
00:23:55.720,00:23:57.680,It's all right. She's with me.
00:23:57.760,00:23:59.040,"Miss Cackle, what's going on?"
00:23:59.120,00:24:02.320,The school is in danger and Miss Gullet has been helping me.
00:24:02.960,00:24:05.280,-Let us in. -We'll need to invite you.
00:24:11.480,00:24:14.360,"Sorry, well met and welcome, Miss Cackle."
00:24:19.320,00:24:21.640,"A terrible thing has happened, my dear girls."
00:24:22.280,00:24:24.160,Agatha has stolen my powers.
00:24:25.200,00:24:30.560,Will one of you make a brave and noble sacrifice and give up your magic for your headmistress?
00:24:32.160,00:24:34.960,"-I will. -No, I won't let you."
00:24:36.160,00:24:37.280,I'll do it.
00:24:43.040,00:24:44.200,"I'm sorry, Maud."
00:24:46.520,00:24:47.640,I should have listened.
00:24:49.560,00:24:52.800,You were right. I'll trust you next time.
00:24:54.000,00:24:58.120,"I, Esmerelda Hallow, freely gift my witch's powers..."
00:24:58.680,00:25:00.840,...to the one with whom I stand.
00:25:02.400,00:25:04.160,...to the one with whom I stand.
00:25:37.320,00:25:39.520,But I'm Agatha.
00:25:43.280,00:25:44.560,You knew!
00:25:54.120,00:25:56.160,I think you might want to see this.
00:26:06.520,00:26:07.880,They lied.
00:26:10.960,00:26:12.960,You lied.
00:26:21.440,00:26:25.080,You can't be headmistress. You haven't even got magical powers.
00:26:36.760,00:26:37.760,Wrong.
00:26:38.520,00:26:42.080,Anyone else want to question my leadership?
00:26:58.080,00:27:01.480,You were right. Please don't be mad at me.
00:27:02.320,00:27:03.920,Miss Hardbroom!
00:27:04.640,00:27:05.760,Maud!
00:27:07.680,00:27:10.120,Did you leave school grounds without permission?
00:27:12.040,00:27:14.040,"She did, Miss Hardbroom."
00:27:17.240,00:27:20.040,I shall transfer you home immediately.
00:27:30.640,00:27:31.680,Mildred!
00:27:32.600,00:27:33.440,Mum.
00:27:40.240,00:27:42.240,"You did the right thing, Maud."
00:27:43.760,00:27:44.800,I know.
00:00:53.320,00:00:54.360,What are you doing?
00:00:54.440,00:00:57.800,You know we're supposed to be studying for spell science.
00:00:59.840,00:01:02.960,"Mildred, you know we're not allowed to use unofficial potions."
00:01:05.000,00:01:08.080,And you can't afford to fail any more classes.
00:01:08.160,00:01:11.560,"Look, I know you're right, but... whoo!"
00:01:18.320,00:01:19.160,Maud?
00:01:37.960,00:01:39.720,"Use the shower spell, Mildred."
00:01:44.400,00:01:46.040,I think I swallowed a fly!
00:02:02.240,00:02:08.199,"Dear Mildred, as you're a growing witch now, I've had a clear-out of your old toys to charity."
00:02:08.800,00:02:11.000,Didn't think you'd want to lose this one.
00:02:11.080,00:02:12.360,Puss!
00:02:40.080,00:02:43.840,Just my first toy. My first present from my mum.
00:02:44.800,00:02:48.160,"When I was little, I was only ever allowed an actual bear."
00:02:48.240,00:02:50.280,An actual...
00:02:50.920,00:02:53.080,"-With claws and stuff? -Yeah, I know."
00:02:53.160,00:02:55.640,"Just like everybody else. Boring, eh?"
00:02:56.480,00:02:57.960,"Come on, we're late."
00:03:08.520,00:03:12.320,must be adhered to at all times.
00:03:12.400,00:03:14.400,"Maud, look what my mum sent!"
00:03:28.920,00:03:30.520,Why did Maud do that?
00:03:31.600,00:03:32.800,You're a bit stinky.
00:03:35.600,00:03:37.240,Do you think she's OK?
00:03:41.840,00:03:52.280,I said I would like you to demonstrate a simple animal transformation by turning this mouse into a frog.
00:03:53.560,00:03:55.080,A frog?
00:03:55.160,00:03:56.320,Ask Maud.
00:04:02.000,00:04:05.160,"Maybe you should ask someone else, Miss Gullett."
00:04:16.560,00:04:18.760,One and all will be agog...
00:04:26.520,00:04:31.360,"I said mouse into frog, not girl into hog!"
00:04:37.320,00:04:39.960,Stop that pig!
00:04:47.400,00:04:51.720,What girl is that?
00:04:53.520,00:04:55.640,"It's Ethel Hallow, Miss Hardbroom."
00:04:55.720,00:05:01.920,"And who, as if I did not already know, is responsible for this?"
00:05:06.080,00:05:08.000,Mildred Hubble.
00:05:09.840,00:05:12.800,Reverse the spell.
00:05:20.560,00:05:22.240,um...
00:05:23.280,00:05:25.160,Ethel Hallow!
00:05:34.080,00:05:45.800,surely this proves that girls from non-magical backgrounds Uh...
00:05:56.320,00:05:58.440,This is a disgrace.
00:05:58.520,00:06:01.120,You will go to your room and you will study.
00:06:02.160,00:06:06.880,If you cannot perform a simple frog transformation by...
00:06:09.440,00:06:11.280,two o'clock...
00:06:11.920,00:06:14.560,you will be handing in your hat and cloak.
00:06:21.840,00:06:22.840,Mum!
00:06:28.520,00:06:29.840,Mum!
00:06:40.880,00:06:43.080,That was my only magic mirror credit.
00:06:44.640,00:06:47.560,"And you only get them for doing things right, so I'm never gonna get any."
00:06:52.760,00:06:57.040,"It's impossible, Tabby. I don't even have Maud to help me."
00:07:14.040,00:07:16.720,"Tabby, I want to go home."
00:07:18.200,00:07:20.960,"I'm going to help Millie. Can you stay out of it, please?"
00:07:21.040,00:07:23.040,Don't blame me for showing her how to have fun.
00:07:23.120,00:07:28.760,"Don't blame me for showing her how to learn magic, which she's now got to do in super record time, otherwise she's..."
00:07:30.040,00:07:31.600,...out of here.
00:07:40.480,00:07:42.680,"It's Maud and Enid, they're having a fight."
00:07:42.760,00:07:44.160,-What? -I think it's about you.
00:07:44.240,00:07:45.640,You better come quick.
00:07:54.440,00:07:56.120,"Right, you two, this is..."
00:08:01.040,00:08:02.200,silly.
00:08:02.960,00:08:15.360,"I'm stuck with this, Mildred Hubble, because no one can undo it You know, it isn't that noticeable."
00:08:15.760,00:08:18.680,"I mean, your nose was pretty big before, so..."
00:08:19.560,00:08:21.800,"Wait, that came out wrong. I..."
00:08:26.520,00:08:29.040,witches who can do a simple transformation spell.
00:08:29.880,00:08:32.240,Witches like me!
00:08:33.120,00:08:39.960,"In pond or lake or swampy bog, from this day, you live as a frog!"
00:09:10.960,00:09:11.920,What?
00:09:33.360,00:09:35.960,I can smell the magic.
00:09:47.280,00:09:52.360,"Oh, find whoever put the spell on you and have it reversed."
00:10:01.200,00:10:02.560,Hmm.
00:10:15.840,00:10:20.920,You can come... or you can be hedgehog food.
00:10:24.520,00:10:27.760,if she hasn't fallen down the mountain and injured herself horribly.
00:10:27.840,00:10:30.240,"That's what I like about you, so positive!"
00:10:30.760,00:10:35.360,Mildred's had enough and left! What is there to be positive about?
00:10:38.360,00:10:41.040,"Well, Ethel Hallow has a snout now so it's not all bad."
00:10:44.040,00:10:45.640,Do you ever loosen up?
00:10:45.720,00:10:50.640,I'm about to leave the Academy during a school day without a permission slip!
00:10:53.600,00:10:56.280,"No leaving the premises, you know that!"
00:10:56.840,00:10:58.280,"What are you up to, anyway?"
00:11:00.040,00:11:04.520,"Miss Bat, we think Mildred might-- We think Mildred opened the door to the flying postman."
00:11:04.600,00:11:06.680,Postman! Anything for me?
00:11:10.320,00:11:11.600,Were you expecting anything?
00:11:11.680,00:11:17.120,"I have been for a long, long time, young Maud Spellbody."
00:11:17.200,00:11:19.560,"Maybe one day, maybe."
00:11:21.800,00:11:24.320,"Now, run along to lessons."
00:11:28.280,00:11:30.160,Why wouldn't you let me tell her?
00:11:30.240,00:11:41.800,Because she'll tell HB and HB will know that Mil isn't studying for her test Tabby?
00:11:45.480,00:11:46.440,It's Mildred's.
00:11:47.560,00:11:49.200,She hasn't left.
00:11:49.280,00:11:52.440,But why would she pack her bag and then just abandon it?
00:11:53.320,00:11:54.600,Unless something was wrong.
00:11:54.680,00:11:57.800,I've got all sorts of pirated potions stuffed in my wardrobe.
00:11:57.880,00:11:59.280,Let's go and see what we can use.
00:11:59.360,00:12:01.280,Maybe I have some Find and Seek sugars left.
00:12:21.480,00:12:25.440,"Albert, Albatross, Al..."
00:12:26.920,00:12:28.520,"...gernon, that's it."
00:12:28.600,00:12:31.000,Algernon Rowan Webb.
00:12:32.320,00:12:37.680,"First wizard ever to teach in that school, for a brief period, at least."
00:12:43.280,00:12:46.040,you'd never get past the familiars.
00:12:51.080,00:12:56.000,When you're a frog... you're their lunch.
00:13:18.680,00:13:22.840,You helped me get back in as a human. You could help me get back in as a frog.
00:13:22.920,00:13:24.520,Give it up!
00:13:25.120,00:13:27.600,Relax.
00:13:27.680,00:13:29.560,You're safe here.
00:13:37.560,00:13:39.760,What in the world are you doing with that broomstick?
00:13:39.840,00:13:43.280,It's a little-known function. It's called sweeping.
00:13:43.880,00:13:45.160,But what is it for?
00:13:45.960,00:13:49.000,Dusting... for prints.
00:14:01.360,00:14:03.800,"The scene of the crime, Midnight."
00:14:08.000,00:14:10.560,I'm getting a faint odor of potion.
00:14:22.040,00:14:24.640,Who gives herself gold stars?
00:14:28.720,00:14:32.720,"Ethel Hallow, that's who! This is all the proof we need."
00:14:35.000,00:14:36.400,Oops.
00:14:36.480,00:14:39.600,"I had the evidence in my hand, you nincompoop!"
00:14:39.680,00:14:41.480,Nincompoop? Really?
00:14:44.920,00:14:47.280,I could have made Ethel confess!
00:14:47.360,00:14:49.480,Ethel! Big surprise.
00:14:49.560,00:14:54.080,"If all you need is a confession, I've got a truth-telling serum we could use on her."
00:14:54.160,00:14:58.520,No. You breaking the rules is what got Mildred into this mess.
00:14:58.600,00:15:01.160,You following the rules is what got her into this mess.
00:15:03.760,00:15:05.360,Why will you not let me help?
00:15:06.440,00:15:09.440,"See, you don't like being left on the sidelines either."
00:15:09.520,00:15:12.160,No one's trying to do that to you.
00:15:12.240,00:15:18.480,"You'll always be Mildred's best friend, but it doesn't mean that she can't have fun with me once in a while."
00:15:20.480,00:15:21.840,"Come on, Midnight."
00:15:22.520,00:15:24.720,I'll prove Ethel was here by myself.
00:15:35.480,00:15:38.840,Then I'm afraid I must sincerely apologize for what I'm about to do.
00:15:42.480,00:15:44.760,Stop! Please!
00:15:55.760,00:15:58.040,I don't remember the details.
00:16:01.480,00:16:05.680,"If you didn't miss being a human, why would you have kept this human stuff?"
00:16:23.560,00:16:27.880,I think she was important to me before I...
00:16:28.600,00:16:31.880,I just don't remember her name.
00:16:34.200,00:16:36.440,"to give you this, and you just forgotten her."
00:16:37.200,00:16:39.600,"Well, I have someone who cares about me. My mum."
00:16:40.720,00:16:43.520,Are you going to stand by while I forget her?
00:16:57.880,00:17:01.120,When Miss Cackle made Miss Hardbroom's cap disappear...
00:17:02.440,00:17:04.839,"Well, nobody invited me!"
00:17:06.400,00:17:10.080,"Oh, there must have been an oversight, Miss Gullett."
00:17:10.160,00:17:12.480,"-Mmm. -Oversight, definitely!"
00:17:15.880,00:17:19.240,for what I'm sure will be a pitiful display.
00:17:19.319,00:17:25.880,"Actually, I have a very important potion to prepare for my next class, Miss Hardbroom."
00:17:27.040,00:17:30.760,I'm sure you can cope very well without me.
00:17:36.760,00:17:40.080,"Two words, Miss Cackle, and the second is Hubble."
00:17:40.160,00:17:43.200,"Oh, dear! What's she done now?"
00:17:43.280,00:17:44.800,It's what she hasn't done.
00:17:45.440,00:17:49.400,Competence in basic magical tasks is a standard entry requirement.
00:17:49.480,00:17:57.640,"And if the girl is not ready and willing, we will, of course, be forced to fail her. Automatically."
00:18:03.280,00:18:06.600,"The corridor should clear soon, sir. That's the bell for fourth period."
00:18:17.520,00:18:19.920,Unicorns are real too!
00:18:59.120,00:19:00.040,Ethel!
00:19:05.320,00:19:09.560,"Anyone looks at my nose, they're straight for the pond."
00:19:09.640,00:19:13.320,No one's looking and no one suspects what you've done.
00:19:13.720,00:19:17.600,"I mean, how could they? It's not like I'd have said anything."
00:19:29.680,00:19:31.120,"I need a word, please."
00:19:31.200,00:19:35.480,"By which she means you are busted, snout face!"
00:20:04.160,00:20:08.560,You can never have a big enough stock of fresh frog's eyeballs.
00:20:24.400,00:20:26.280,...she's not here.
00:20:28.800,00:20:30.960,I was very clear about time.
00:20:33.280,00:20:37.240,I'm afraid Mildred can't be here and she knows why!
00:20:39.760,00:20:40.960,That you're you!
00:20:41.040,00:20:43.760,"Miss Cackle, I have no idea what this is about."
00:20:44.520,00:20:48.200,"She changed Mildred into something, and now we don't know where she is."
00:20:48.280,00:20:49.120,What?
00:21:15.000,00:21:17.200,Oi! What do you think you're doing?
00:21:17.280,00:21:19.840,-This is Mildred. -Don't be ridiculous.
00:21:23.720,00:21:25.800,"Ethel transformed you, didn't she?"
00:21:29.080,00:21:30.920,"Change her back, please."
00:21:35.760,00:21:40.520,"In pond, lake or swampy bog, bring this girl back from a frog!"
00:21:44.400,00:21:46.160,"Mil! Oh, Millie!"
00:21:46.240,00:21:48.040,Millie! Millie!
00:21:48.720,00:21:49.880,You're back!
00:21:50.240,00:21:51.560,"To my office, then."
00:21:51.640,00:21:54.520,There will be a serious price to pay for this breach of the code.
00:21:54.600,00:21:58.520,"Miss Cackle, I went to the pond. Another frog helped me get back."
00:21:58.600,00:22:02.520,"He was a human, too, a wizard, Algernon Rowan Webb."
00:22:04.560,00:22:07.720,-That's him! Stop! -Nonsense! This is just another frog!
00:22:07.800,00:22:10.040,"Miss Cackle, please, listen!"
00:22:10.960,00:22:16.080,"Actually, she's telling the truth. I've waited for him for a very long time."
00:22:24.720,00:22:27.680,No running! Health and safety!
00:22:30.720,00:22:32.760,It's not my fault!
00:22:32.840,00:22:37.400,I needed the job. I wasn't going to lose out to a wizard!
00:22:38.640,00:22:40.160,Change him back!
00:22:41.880,00:22:47.840,"Tail of rat and leg of lizard, turn this frog back into a wizard!"
00:23:07.280,00:23:09.920,I remember everything.
00:23:11.520,00:23:13.320,Especially what she did!
00:23:15.080,00:23:19.400,"It gives me no pleasure to say... you are dismissed, Miss Gullett."
00:23:20.520,00:23:23.120,You really are the worst teacher.
00:23:25.000,00:23:29.040,"This is all very well, but there is still the matter of a test t-t..."
00:23:32.040,00:23:33.880,Mildred Hubble!
00:23:42.240,00:23:43.760,How did you get there?
00:23:43.840,00:23:46.160,Hmm! I'm a wizard!
00:23:46.640,00:23:49.920,What are they teaching you girls these days?
00:23:50.400,00:23:59.160,"Well, I'm leaving now, Mr. Rowan Webb, so-- You don't strike me as someone who'd settled for the safety of the pond, Mildred Hubble."
00:23:59.240,00:24:00.240,"I'm no witch, either."
00:24:03.560,00:24:11.840,"I was the first wizard in a witches' academy, and it's tough, isn't it? Hmm?"
00:24:13.040,00:24:16.640,A non-witch might not make the grade.
00:24:16.720,00:24:18.880,I haven't made the grade.
00:24:20.160,00:24:21.000,Go home then.
00:24:22.920,00:24:31.240,"But at the back of your mind, there will always be a little voice wondering if you could have made it."
00:24:31.320,00:24:41.000,"I know... because I've been hearing that little voice myself for a long, long time."
00:24:43.920,00:24:47.360,-The test! -You can't walk away now!
00:24:52.480,00:24:56.800,"You give it a try and so will I, hmm?"
00:24:58.200,00:25:01.320,I felt sure that she would at least try.
00:25:03.040,00:25:07.160,"I say, you haven't lost your touch, Mr. Rowan Webb!"
00:25:08.960,00:25:10.120,I'm ready for the test.
00:25:18.040,00:25:19.520,Very well.
00:25:23.480,00:25:24.480,Frog.
00:25:32.360,00:25:37.960,"One and all will be agog, when you see before you a tiny frog!"
00:25:45.280,00:25:46.360,Tiny frog!
00:25:50.880,00:25:51.840,Tiny frog!
00:25:52.920,00:25:54.000,Frog!
00:25:54.080,00:25:54.920,Frog!
00:25:56.240,00:25:57.640,-Frog! -Stop.
00:25:58.280,00:26:10.000,"I think we've seen all we need to see. It's obvious that Mildred Hubble-- I haven't seen a multi-transformation like that in some time, have you, Miss Cackle?"
00:26:11.960,00:26:15.680,"A very impressive display, Mildred Hubble."
00:26:16.520,00:26:19.600,"Now, back to lessons."
00:26:22.080,00:26:24.440,Oh... um...
00:26:30.240,00:26:34.560,"I'll work out how to fix her nose, but the punishment will fit the crime."
00:26:34.640,00:26:35.520,Hmm!
00:26:45.800,00:26:47.760,"Oh, I'll get you for this, Mildred Hubble!"
00:26:49.480,00:26:52.520,This place is a health and safety minefield.
00:26:59.280,00:27:01.280,"You were the one who saved Millie, not me."
00:27:01.360,00:27:04.600,"If you hadn't recognized that song, I dread to think what would have happened."
00:27:06.880,00:27:09.680,I suppose everybody can use more than one friend.
00:27:11.760,00:27:16.760,"Now be honest, did you really take Drusilla one mile straight up?"
00:27:16.840,00:27:18.560,I really did!
00:27:19.840,00:27:23.280,"You two, I didn't get a proper chance to say thanks for rescuing me."
00:27:23.360,00:27:25.120,It's only what you would have done.
00:27:25.200,00:27:27.760,"Although, you'd have made a bigger mess of it."
00:27:27.840,00:27:29.160,Yeah.
00:27:29.240,00:27:31.360,"In other words, we make a pretty crafty team, right?"
00:27:31.440,00:27:32.440,Right!
00:27:36.760,00:27:39.000,-Mr. Rowan Webb. -Come on!
00:27:39.080,00:27:42.080,Your new spell science teacher!
00:27:43.200,00:27:48.000,And I hope things are gonna get a bit more intere... sting...
00:27:48.080,00:27:50.360,around... here.
00:00:41.960,00:00:43.080,Look!
00:00:53.320,00:00:56.720,-Looks just like her. Send it to me! -How do I do that?
00:00:56.800,00:00:59.360,Just write my name on it and tap it three times.
00:01:11.920,00:01:14.000,See? It even says who it's from.
00:01:18.640,00:01:19.880,She's here.
00:01:19.960,00:01:21.120,Who?
00:01:21.800,00:01:23.600,"The new girl, Enid Nightshade."
00:01:24.200,00:01:25.120,Come on!
00:01:35.200,00:01:37.600,"I don't get it, why is this new girl such a big deal?"
00:01:40.880,00:01:43.160,I knew we should have approached in stealth mode.
00:01:43.680,00:01:46.480,"They want a show, let's give them a show."
00:01:46.560,00:01:47.440,Let's go.
00:01:53.160,00:01:54.720,"That's her, that's Enid."
00:01:55.240,00:01:59.000,"Look at me, my parents are famous! What a show-off!"
00:02:13.080,00:02:16.720,Double chanting in five minutes. Don't be late!
00:02:26.440,00:02:28.240,"I do hope you'll be happy here, Enid."
00:02:28.320,00:02:30.880,She's here to learn. Make sure you do!
00:02:30.960,00:02:33.680,"Well met, Mistress Nightshade."
00:02:33.760,00:02:36.160,"Well met, Mr. Nightshade."
00:02:44.440,00:02:45.440,Well met.
00:02:47.680,00:02:49.080,If you'd like to follow me.
00:03:02.760,00:03:06.040,"I'm sorry, Ethel, I can be really thick sometimes."
00:03:07.000,00:03:08.200,It's not your fault.
00:03:08.280,00:03:13.840,It's just everyone's making such a fuss about Enid Nightshade and her stupid parents.
00:03:14.520,00:03:17.400,T-Totally. You're so right.
00:03:22.760,00:03:24.600,Well met. I'm Ethel Hallow.
00:03:24.680,00:03:25.640,"Hey, Ethel."
00:03:27.760,00:03:30.920,"If there's anything you need to know, I'm the best witch in Year One."
00:03:32.840,00:03:37.320,Yes. I should be head of year. Miss Hardbroom said so.
00:03:37.400,00:03:39.320,Come with me. I'll get you your chanting book.
00:03:48.800,00:03:52.560,"Mildred, would you like to share the joke?"
00:03:53.080,00:03:54.760,Um... No!
00:03:55.480,00:03:56.640,No!
00:04:00.520,00:04:02.800,Maud Spellbody!
00:04:02.880,00:04:07.280,"Miss Cackle's office, now!"
00:04:07.360,00:04:12.960,Y-You mean you want me to go and see her?
00:04:13.040,00:04:15.600,Build this girl a gingerbread house.
00:04:15.680,00:04:17.160,Out!
00:04:17.240,00:04:19.959,Leave that thing here.
00:04:26.160,00:04:30.160,"Maglets are to be used for work, not silly jokes."
00:04:30.680,00:04:34.520,"As head of Year One, you need to set a better example."
00:04:35.440,00:04:36.840,"Yes, Miss Cackle."
00:04:37.360,00:04:40.200,Unless you want me to appoint Ethel Hallow instead?
00:04:40.880,00:04:44.840,"Ethel? No, you can't do that to us."
00:04:44.920,00:04:48.360,"I noticed you said us, not me."
00:04:48.880,00:04:50.320,That's a good start!
00:04:52.480,00:04:55.880,Being a leader isn't about being the best.
00:04:55.960,00:05:00.840,"It's about looking after your team, bringing them closer together."
00:05:03.440,00:05:07.680,I notice you Year One girls tend to congregate under the main staircase.
00:05:09.040,00:05:14.880,"Well, we don't have a proper common room, so it's sort of our place."
00:05:17.560,00:05:20.600,It is our place.
00:05:20.680,00:05:27.040,"I suppose if I made it better, that would bring us together, wouldn't it?"
00:05:27.120,00:05:30.760,Now that sounds like the sort of thing a leader would do.
00:05:41.560,00:05:43.960,"Louder, girls! I can't hear you!"
00:06:00.840,00:06:04.320,You are making a mockery of the witching culture.
00:06:04.400,00:06:06.280,"No, no, it's just Enid!"
00:06:07.200,00:06:12.440,"-You were making fun of the new girl? -No, um-- -Miss Bat. Miss Bat. -Yes?"
00:06:12.520,00:06:18.440,"Perhaps Enid needs someone to look after her, to show her around, to help her settle in?"
00:06:22.920,00:06:25.080,"OK, thank you."
00:06:31.600,00:06:33.120,I choose Mildred.
00:06:35.720,00:06:38.160,-Her? -Me!
00:06:38.240,00:06:41.440,"No, no, I don't think that's a good idea at all."
00:06:41.520,00:06:42.880,I don't understand.
00:06:43.520,00:06:48.400,"Miss Cackle told Mummy that every single girl here is a hardworking, talented witch."
00:06:49.040,00:06:50.240,Did she say that?
00:06:51.120,00:06:54.760,"Oh! Well, in that case, Mildred, from now on..."
00:07:07.520,00:07:12.320,I'll show you the potions lab and-- Later. There's something I have to do first.
00:07:13.320,00:07:17.560,"Mildred Hubble is so fake, sucking up to Enid just 'cause she's a witch."
00:07:17.640,00:07:20.800,Yeah. Maud won't be happy when she finds out.
00:07:21.440,00:07:22.640,Maud?
00:07:25.640,00:07:27.960,"Maud, who took my place as head of year?"
00:07:34.360,00:07:35.800,What are you doing?
00:07:37.320,00:07:39.560,I hope it went OK with Cackle.
00:07:39.640,00:07:43.280,Sorry I can't meet this lunchtime. Have to show Enid around.
00:07:45.680,00:07:48.080,Why are you reading Maud's messages?
00:07:49.360,00:07:51.960,They're not Maud's now. They're mine!
00:07:52.480,00:07:56.920,And we can send messages to Mildred and she'll think they're from Maud.
00:08:09.280,00:08:12.560,They can't have gone. Dad always stays for one last goodbye.
00:08:12.640,00:08:14.040,Not this time.
00:08:32.000,00:08:33.559,You should be in class.
00:08:44.800,00:08:46.480,It's from Ethel.
00:08:46.560,00:08:50.040,Meet me by the stairs ASAP. I need your help.
00:08:51.800,00:08:53.200,Unbelievable!
00:08:54.040,00:08:56.000,"Sorry, I'm busy!"
00:09:00.960,00:09:02.600,"Sorry, I'm busy?"
00:09:04.280,00:09:05.880,Busy with what?
00:09:05.960,00:09:09.840,I really need your help.
00:09:21.680,00:09:23.560,Where did you come from?
00:09:26.080,00:09:29.680,"-Muddles, this is Mildred. -Hi, Muddles."
00:09:33.240,00:09:34.800,He's gorgeous.
00:09:34.880,00:09:37.520,But we're only allowed cats as pets. It's the rules.
00:09:38.760,00:09:41.240,-I like breaking rules. -But this could get you expelled.
00:09:41.760,00:09:44.360,-What? Again? -What do you mean again?
00:09:44.440,00:09:46.200,How many schools have you been to?
00:09:49.280,00:09:50.560,Seventeen.
00:09:53.840,00:09:56.120,"-Hi, Maud. -What are you doing?"
00:09:57.560,00:10:03.880,"Just wondering, how can we make this place... better?"
00:10:04.400,00:10:05.960,What do you mean?
00:10:08.360,00:10:09.360,Nothing.
00:10:11.360,00:10:12.840,Have you seen Mildred?
00:10:14.600,00:10:15.680,Yeah!
00:10:16.400,00:10:20.360,She's been hanging out with Enid... all morning.
00:10:23.040,00:10:27.160,You can't blame Mildred. She's never met anyone famous before.
00:10:31.200,00:10:33.360,You are not getting expelled from here!
00:10:40.640,00:10:43.280,"Oh, no! No!"
00:10:43.360,00:10:45.880,Muddles! Muddles!
00:10:46.720,00:10:50.080,Less than a day! My fastest expulsion yet.
00:10:51.280,00:10:55.080,"You're not taking me down with you. We're going to get him back, now!"
00:10:55.160,00:10:56.000,Mildred.
00:10:56.640,00:10:57.800,Uh...
00:10:59.760,00:11:02.040,I can't believe you're too busy to help me.
00:11:02.120,00:11:03.680,I'm about to get dumped as head of year.
00:11:03.760,00:11:06.440,"No, I will help you, it's just I can't right now."
00:11:11.920,00:11:13.720,"-Knock-knock. -Go away, Ethel."
00:11:15.200,00:11:17.680,I just wanted to see how Enid's settling in.
00:11:19.240,00:11:20.880,"She's fine, but we're busy."
00:11:29.640,00:11:30.880,"Oh, no, you're coming with me."
00:11:33.440,00:11:36.360,It looks like someone's got a new best friend.
00:11:36.440,00:11:37.880,If you need to talk...
00:11:37.960,00:11:40.440,"Sorry, important head-of-year stuff to do."
00:12:03.440,00:12:04.800,I'll get my broomstick.
00:12:09.760,00:12:11.440,Where does that window lead?
00:12:11.920,00:12:13.680,Miss Cackle's office.
00:12:33.680,00:12:36.200,"It's good manners to share, you know."
00:12:45.240,00:12:46.640,We need to get to lessons.
00:12:47.440,00:12:49.640,"All right, I'll break in after class."
00:12:50.920,00:12:51.840,Break in?
00:12:56.000,00:12:59.360,but I really can't have random animals running around my school.
00:13:01.040,00:13:04.200,"I don't know where you came from, but they should have looked after you better."
00:13:04.280,00:13:07.160,You'll be safe here for now and I'll bring you food and water.
00:13:08.080,00:13:13.440,"Sorry it's a little cramped in here, but it's just until we find out who you belong to."
00:13:46.680,00:13:48.040,What's wrong?
00:13:49.360,00:13:53.000,"Maud, she says she's going to be cauldron partners with Ethel today."
00:13:53.760,00:13:55.040,So?
00:13:55.720,00:13:57.680,We're always cauldron partners.
00:14:06.840,00:14:08.280,"Come on, cauldron partner."
00:14:15.200,00:14:16.440,Don't worry about them.
00:14:16.520,00:14:18.480,"They aren't worth it, you know."
00:14:30.040,00:14:32.320,You can be my cauldron partner today.
00:14:37.480,00:14:38.520,To work.
00:14:40.040,00:14:42.520,"Today, we will be making a laughter potion."
00:14:42.600,00:14:45.560,Timing is crucial in comedy.
00:16:17.040,00:16:18.120,Well?
00:16:23.400,00:16:25.680,This is no laughter potion.
00:16:25.760,00:16:27.800,What have you made?
00:16:29.680,00:16:30.760,I see.
00:16:33.000,00:16:34.440,Or rather...
00:16:39.040,00:16:41.320,"Sorry, Miss Hardbroom."
00:16:41.400,00:16:43.160,Nought out of ten.
00:17:11.280,00:17:13.040,"All right, I'll help you."
00:17:15.200,00:17:16.240,Maud.
00:17:18.480,00:17:19.800,What do you want?
00:17:21.319,00:17:22.920,I just want to talk.
00:17:24.840,00:17:26.800,-All right. -Really?
00:17:27.480,00:17:30.080,You're going to forgive her just like that?
00:17:30.720,00:17:35.520,"Of course, if you're happy to settle for second best..."
00:17:41.400,00:17:44.960,"I need to talk to you, you know, as one head of year to another."
00:17:45.680,00:17:48.440,Sure! Anything I can do to help.
00:18:04.240,00:18:07.160,"-Oh, it's you. -We'll get Muddles back. Cheer up."
00:18:07.240,00:18:08.880,It's a good plan. It'll work.
00:18:08.960,00:18:11.720,It's not that. It's Maud.
00:18:14.320,00:18:16.200,Can't you just talk to her?
00:18:24.560,00:18:25.920,One last try.
00:18:28.560,00:18:30.040,What are you saying to her?
00:18:31.240,00:18:32.320,Everything.
00:18:33.800,00:18:35.680,I'm telling her everything.
00:18:50.800,00:18:53.240,"When she gets caught, she's bound to be expelled."
00:18:55.240,00:18:57.080,Is Maud your best friend now?
00:18:58.520,00:18:59.520,No.
00:19:02.040,00:19:04.560,But she could be! Ow!
00:19:06.240,00:19:08.680,Mildred's played right into my hands.
00:19:08.760,00:19:11.600,She'll get expelled and I'll steal her friend.
00:19:12.360,00:19:14.720,Just need to make sure she gets caught.
00:19:22.240,00:19:23.440,Not a lot left.
00:19:23.520,00:19:25.800,That's OK. I'll lick the cauldron.
00:19:26.880,00:19:27.920,Really?
00:19:31.200,00:19:32.240,All right!
00:19:46.920,00:19:50.000,Just because we're invisible doesn't mean we can't be heard.
00:20:06.320,00:20:09.320,Extra creamy milk for you. Good girl.
00:21:43.960,00:21:46.000,Look at all this stuff.
00:21:46.080,00:21:50.600,Magical fireworks: writes rude slogans across the sky!
00:22:24.920,00:22:26.680,"It's been nice knowing you, Mildred Hubble."
00:22:29.200,00:22:31.800,I think the invisibility potion's wearing off.
00:22:34.280,00:22:37.040,"Anyway, where do you think they'll send you next?"
00:22:37.520,00:22:39.840,I suppose I'll just have to go back to a normal school.
00:22:40.760,00:22:42.160,What do you mean normal school?
00:22:42.240,00:22:45.400,"Well, I mean normal where they don't teach magic."
00:22:45.480,00:22:47.080,Why would they send you there?
00:22:47.160,00:22:49.560,No one in my family's magical.
00:22:50.560,00:22:53.640,You mean you got into this school all on your own?
00:22:54.400,00:22:56.960,"On a trial basis, remember?"
00:22:58.080,00:22:59.200,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:00.680,00:23:02.720,"Sorry, I didn't mean to get you thrown out."
00:23:03.640,00:23:04.920,I know.
00:23:09.760,00:23:12.240,You had a bicycle? A real one?
00:23:12.320,00:23:14.600,It really isn't that exciting...
00:23:15.880,00:23:17.520,not when you're used to it.
00:23:21.200,00:23:23.680,"I've learned magic, I've made new friends."
00:23:24.600,00:23:26.320,Didn't you have friends before?
00:23:27.000,00:23:29.960,"Well, yes, but nobody like Maud."
00:23:32.080,00:23:33.480,Or you.
00:23:48.280,00:23:49.680,Our last day.
00:23:53.000,00:24:00.280,And I found Mildred and Enid in the confiscation cupboard. I-- I thought it was safest to shut them in.
00:24:11.400,00:24:16.000,"-Drusilla told me what Ethel did. -Just don't tell Ethel, OK?"
00:24:16.080,00:24:17.040,OK.
00:24:18.840,00:24:19.680,Thank you!
00:25:01.600,00:25:04.360,I suggest you keep it to yourself.
00:25:04.920,00:25:07.480,But... it wasn't a dream.
00:25:09.600,00:25:11.760,You have already interrupted my sleep.
00:25:11.840,00:25:13.760,Now you are trying my patience.
00:25:14.680,00:25:16.760,One thousand lines.
00:25:18.360,00:25:22.680,-So the messages I got... -They were all from Ethel.
00:25:22.760,00:25:26.840,And all of your messages went to her. I should have known.
00:25:28.400,00:25:31.320,I am sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.
00:25:31.840,00:25:32.960,That's OK.
00:25:38.040,00:25:40.160,-Can you help me? -Of course I will!
00:25:43.440,00:25:47.280,-Where did you get all that lot? -Dad always gives me a load of tuck.
00:25:47.360,00:25:49.680,"Now, who's up for a dawn feast?"
00:25:53.840,00:25:55.200,Where did you get all this stuff?
00:25:55.280,00:25:59.400,Esmerelda got it from the prefects' room. They've got loads of spare stuff in there.
00:26:00.520,00:26:02.400,But that's not the most important bit.
00:26:03.920,00:26:04.960,Look!
00:26:09.840,00:26:10.960,You drew that?
00:26:11.040,00:26:13.120,No. Mildred did.
00:26:14.720,00:26:18.120,Miss Cackle will never let you deface the school with that thing.
00:26:20.680,00:26:22.960,"Actually, she thinks it's brilliant."
00:26:23.040,00:26:25.520,"And I'll have my maglet back now, thanks!"
00:26:35.720,00:26:36.560,Where's mine?
00:26:38.960,00:26:40.400,I'm confiscating it.
00:26:41.000,00:26:42.200,You can't!
00:26:42.280,00:26:45.760,"I'm head of year, so... yes, I can."
00:26:57.280,00:26:59.600,"If you get expelled, I'll just paint you out."
00:27:01.760,00:27:03.120,I was thinking...
00:27:04.160,00:27:05.200,maybe I won't.
00:27:09.400,00:27:11.000,Won't get expelled.
00:27:11.760,00:27:13.520,Now I've got a reason not to.
00:27:14.680,00:27:15.920,I've got a friend.
