Millie, you have to wake up!
The Great Wizard's coming.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Huh?
-The Great Wizard!

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

-Yay, wow, amazing!

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Who's the Great Wizard again?

8
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
And he gave no reason at all
of the purpose of his visit?

9
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
The Great Wizard has always been
a man of mystery.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I remember on one occasion, he turned
himself into a chameleon for six weeks

11
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
to win a simple game of hide-and-seek.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Impressive!

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He's like a cross between the Queen
and the Prime Minister,

14
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but of course he's magic,
and he wears a hat instead of a crown.

15
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Morning!
-Morning.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I hope the Great Wizard has a good reason
for getting us up at this hour.

17
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But surely his arrival is reason enough.
He is the Great Wizard.

18
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He's basically the most important wizard
in the whole wide world.

19
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're wearing that?

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why not?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You look... great.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

is about to descend upon us

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and we have yet to organize
a greeting ceremony.

25
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, there's no need for all that.

26
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Meeting the first-years
will be quite sufficient.

27
00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The Great Wizard is an old family friend.
I'm sure he's just popped in to say hello.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And don't shake his hand
unless it's a full moon.

31
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Got it.

-Nice hat, Mildred!

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm surprised you found a hat
big enough to fit your head.

35
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Don't worry about him, he's just
the Great Wizard. It's no big deal.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

-He's here! He's here!
-Perhaps he didn't fancy flying today.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, let us proceed straight
to the greeting ceremony.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Don't worry, we're not going to make you
go through all the formalities.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

of that old-fashioned nonsense.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So there will be no special spells,

and self-control is essential

It's such a delight to see you again.

[Miss Cackle chuckles] Shall we tour

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Are these claims true or aren't they?

There may be some truth in it, but all
these incidents are the work of one pupil.

you have a list of misdemeanors

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

[Great Wizard] It's not just a question
of ability, it's a question of discipline.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
