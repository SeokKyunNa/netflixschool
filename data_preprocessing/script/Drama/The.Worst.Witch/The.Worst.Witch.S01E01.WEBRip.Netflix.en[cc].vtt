You'll soon get to know all about her.
Right, come on this way.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Bit of a maze around here,
but you'll soon get used to it.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The kitchen's in the basement. That's why
the porridge is always so cold.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why don't they just make food by magic?

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Um, magical food's

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's a shame. It tastes a lot better than
the slop they serve here.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Didn't your mother teach you not to be

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

you'd have a kitten of your own.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But just wanting it
doesn't make me a witch.

You saw me on the broomstick, so you must
have some magic in your family.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Didn't anything ever happen to you

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
