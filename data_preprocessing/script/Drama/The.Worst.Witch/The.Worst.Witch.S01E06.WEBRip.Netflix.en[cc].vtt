I am your teacher, so I'll t-t-teach.

Miss Darkside, I won't do it again.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Right, first-years.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Let's do this together.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
When James VI of Scotland
became king of England, too,

218
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because they thought things
were about to get easier. But...

220
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And the witches weren't best pleased.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
A whole head seems rather extreme.
How about a finger instead?

224
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But old Jambo was not for turning,

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
so a certain Guy Fawkes,

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And that's how the Gunpowder Plot
really came to be.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and lit a fuse leading
to a whacking great barrel!

234
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But that morning,
the king received a peculiar postcard.

Don't think much of the food.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:33.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, as the barrel was about to boom...

240
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But instead of flinging him on the fire
like those non-witches do,

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
we celebrated instead.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're the best teacher ever.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What a splendid command of witchery,

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hey, I know what you've heard,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But don't be scared.
I save that stuff for the kids.

I'll be a pussycat with you.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:33.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Her conversation is still
almost entirely sock-centered.

[Miss Cackle] I suppose
it was bound to happen eventually.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Perhaps now's the time.

really is skipping the test.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
All it needs is for Miss Cackle
to ring her mum.

Mildred's mum asked specifically
not to be disturbed,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
not until she feels a little better.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Then I'll speak to Mildred instead.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Really, Ethel, the staff have told me
all about your tendency for tall tales.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This isn't a tall tale.
Her mum told us herself.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

No, you don't,
it just comes naturally to you.

Maybe then my mum would be even
half as interested in me as my sister.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think it really is time
I gave the Hubble household a call.

I'm going to be absolutely honest.
This is not going to plan.
