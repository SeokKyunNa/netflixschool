00:01:33.640,00:01:34.720,ELLA: How's your blog going?
00:01:36.280,00:01:39.160,"Yeah, good."
00:01:40.280,00:01:41.760,"You haven't written a word, have you?"
00:01:41.800,00:01:43.480,"You just wrote, Still has trust issues."
00:01:44.920,00:01:47.400,And you read my writing upside down.
00:01:48.520,00:01:49.560,You see what I mean?
00:01:51.760,00:02:00.040,"John, you're a soldier and it's going to take you a while to adjust to civilian life."
00:02:00.080,00:02:04.600,And writing a blog about everything that happens to you will honestly help you.
00:02:06.640,00:02:08.520,Nothing happens to me.
00:02:46.000,00:02:47.280,JEFFREY: What do you mean there's no ruddy car?
00:02:47.320,00:02:49.480,"He went to Waterloo, I'm sorry."
00:02:49.520,00:02:51.720,-Get a cab!
00:02:53.920,00:02:55.840,-I love you.
00:03:17.760,00:03:23.160,MARGARET: My husband was a happy man who lived life to the full.
00:03:24.200,00:03:26.640,He loved his family and his work.
00:03:28.280,00:03:38.760,And that he should have taken his own life in this way is a mystery and a shock to all who knew him.
00:03:54.760,00:03:56.920,Ah!
00:03:56.960,00:03:58.720,"-I'll be back in two minutes, mate."
00:03:58.760,00:04:00.400,I'm just going home to get my umbrella.
00:04:00.440,00:04:01.760,You can share mine.
00:04:01.800,00:04:03.320,"Two minutes, all right?"
00:04:38.760,00:04:39.880,She still dancing?
00:04:39.920,00:04:41.840,"Yeah, if you can call it that."
00:04:41.880,00:04:43.120,Did you get the car keys off her?
00:04:43.160,00:04:44.600,out of her bag.
00:04:46.200,00:04:47.400,Where is she?
00:05:02.320,00:05:09.840,"DONOVAN: The body of Beth Davenport, Junior Minister for Transport, was found late last night on a building site in Greater London."
00:05:09.880,00:05:13.080,Preliminary investigations suggest that this was suicide.
00:05:13.120,00:05:20.320,We can confirm that this apparent suicide closely resembles those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and James Phillimore.
00:05:20.360,00:05:23.360,"In the light of this, these incidents are now being treated as linked."
00:05:23.400,00:05:27.440,"The investigation is ongoing, but Detective Inspector Lestrade will take questions now."
00:05:28.840,00:05:30.760,"Detective Inspector, how can suicides be linked?"
00:05:30.800,00:05:33.520,"Well, they all took the same poison."
00:05:33.560,00:05:37.640,"Um, they were all found in places they had no reason to be."
00:05:37.680,00:05:39.120,None of them had shown any prior intentions...
00:05:39.160,00:05:41.480,But you can't have serial suicides.
00:05:41.520,00:05:43.160,"Well, apparently you can."
00:05:43.200,00:05:45.000,"These three people, there's nothing that links them?"
00:05:45.040,00:05:47.720,There's no link we've found yet but...
00:05:47.760,00:05:49.640,We're looking for it.
00:05:56.960,00:06:00.000,"-If you've all got texts, please ignore them."
00:06:00.040,00:06:01.680,"Yeah, well, just ignore that."
00:06:01.720,00:06:05.400,"If there are no more questions for Detective Inspector Lestrade, I'm going to bring this session to an end."
00:06:05.440,00:06:08.720,"If they're suicides, what are you investigating?"
00:06:08.760,00:06:13.480,"As I say, these suicides are clearly linked. Um..."
00:06:13.520,00:06:17.120,"It's an unusual situation, we've got our best people investigating."
00:06:20.960,00:06:23.040,REPORTER: It says wrong again.
00:06:23.080,00:06:26.920,One more question.
00:06:26.960,00:06:29.760,"And if they are, is this the work of a serial killer?"
00:06:29.800,00:06:34.120,"I... I know that you'd like writing about these, but these do appear to be suicides."
00:06:34.160,00:06:38.440,We know the difference.
00:06:38.480,00:06:41.520,"Yes, but if they are murders, how do people keep themselves safe?"
00:06:41.560,00:06:43.160,"Well, don't commit suicide."
00:06:44.240,00:06:45.720,Daily Mail.
00:06:45.760,00:06:53.360,"Obviously, this is a frightening time for people, but all anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions."
00:06:53.400,00:06:55.240,We are all as safe as we want to be.
00:07:04.040,00:07:05.360,Thank you.
00:07:09.120,00:07:12.360,You've got to stop him doing that. He's making us look like idiots.
00:07:12.400,00:07:14.680,"If you can tell me how he does it, I'll stop him."
00:07:26.800,00:07:28.800,John! John Watson!
00:07:30.720,00:07:33.200,"Stamford, Mike Stamford."
00:07:33.240,00:07:35.200,"Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello."
00:07:35.240,00:07:38.000,"-Yeah, I know, I got fat."
00:07:38.040,00:07:40.560,I heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at.
00:07:41.680,00:07:43.040,I got shot.
00:07:45.840,00:07:47.440,Hmm. Ah.
00:07:49.040,00:07:51.000,Are you still at Barts then?
00:07:51.040,00:07:54.640,Teaching now.
00:07:54.680,00:07:56.640,"-God, I hate them."
00:07:56.680,00:07:59.040,"What about you, just staying in town till you get yourself sorted?"
00:07:59.080,00:08:00.960,I can't afford London on an Army pension.
00:08:01.000,00:08:04.320,And you couldn't bear to be anywhere else. That's not the John Watson I know.
00:08:04.360,00:08:06.240,"Yeah, I'm not the John Watson."
00:08:11.080,00:08:12.520,Couldn't Harry help?
00:08:12.560,00:08:15.280,like that's gonna happen.
00:08:15.320,00:08:18.120,"I don't know, get a flat share or something?"
00:08:18.160,00:08:19.920,"Come on, who'd want me for a flatmate?"
00:08:23.200,00:08:25.840,-What?
00:08:27.520,00:08:28.800,Who was the first?
00:08:32.760,00:08:34.200,-How fresh?
00:08:34.240,00:08:36.320,"67, natural causes."
00:08:36.360,00:08:39.320,Used to work here.
00:08:40.440,00:08:41.720,Fine.
00:08:41.760,00:08:43.720,We'll start with the riding crop.
00:08:54.840,00:08:58.320,"So, bad day was it?"
00:08:58.360,00:09:00.480,I need to know what bruises form in the next 20 minutes.
00:09:00.520,00:09:03.160,A man's alibi depends on it.
00:09:03.200,00:09:05.960,"Listen, I was wondering."
00:09:06.000,00:09:08.880,You're wearing lipstick.
00:09:08.920,00:09:12.040,"I, uh..."
00:09:13.200,00:09:15.360,"Sorry, you were saying?"
00:09:15.400,00:09:17.880,I was wondering if you'd like to have coffee?
00:09:17.920,00:09:20.040,"Black, two sugars, please."
00:09:22.200,00:09:23.320,Okay.
00:09:35.920,00:09:37.280,Bit different from my day.
00:09:37.320,00:09:38.720,"Oh, you've no idea!"
00:09:38.760,00:09:41.280,"Mike, can I borrow your phone?"
00:09:41.320,00:09:42.440,And what's wrong with the landline?
00:09:42.480,00:09:43.880,I prefer to text.
00:09:44.600,00:09:46.520,"Sorry, it's in my coat."
00:09:47.840,00:09:50.200,"Uh, here, use mine."
00:09:51.360,00:09:54.080,"Oh, thank you."
00:09:54.120,00:09:55.320,"This is an old friend of mine, John Watson."
00:09:59.880,00:10:01.760,Afghanistan or Iraq?
00:10:03.960,00:10:05.040,Sorry?
00:10:05.080,00:10:06.960,"Which was it, Afghanistan or Iraq?"
00:10:09.920,00:10:12.200,how did you know...
00:10:12.240,00:10:14.880,"Ah, Molly! Coffee, thank you."
00:10:14.920,00:10:16.800,What happened to the lipstick?
00:10:16.840,00:10:18.600,-It wasn't working for me.
00:10:18.640,00:10:21.280,I thought it was a big improvement.
00:10:22.280,00:10:23.320,MOLLY: Okay.
00:10:24.920,00:10:26.200,How do you feel about the violin?
00:10:30.160,00:10:32.080,"Sorry, what?"
00:10:32.120,00:10:34.800,I play the violin when I'm thinking and sometimes I don't talk for days on end.
00:10:34.840,00:10:36.640,Would that bother you?
00:10:36.680,00:10:38.200,Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.
00:10:40.280,00:10:43.160,-You told him about me?
00:10:43.200,00:10:45.280,Who said anything about flatmates?
00:10:45.320,00:10:49.400,I did. I told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for.
00:10:49.440,00:10:54.000,"Now here he is, just after lunch with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan."
00:10:54.040,00:10:56.120,Wasn't a difficult leap.
00:10:56.160,00:10:57.680,How did you know about Afghanistan?
00:10:57.720,00:11:00.000,Got my eye on a nice little place in Central London.
00:11:00.040,00:11:01.760,Together we ought to be able to afford it.
00:11:01.800,00:11:03.600,"We'll meet there tomorrow evening, 7:00."
00:11:03.640,00:11:06.880,"Sorry, got to dash."
00:11:07.880,00:11:09.440,Is that it?
00:11:09.480,00:11:11.880,Is that what?
00:11:11.920,00:11:13.880,We've only just met and we're going to go look at a flat?
00:11:15.040,00:11:16.040,Problem?
00:11:18.960,00:11:20.520,We don't know a thing about each other.
00:11:20.560,00:11:24.200,"I don't know where we're meeting, I don't even know your name."
00:11:24.240,00:11:27.200,I know you're an Army doctor.
00:11:27.240,00:11:34.960,"I know you've got a brother who's worried about you but you won't go to him for help 'cause you don't approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic and more likely because he recently walked out on his wife."
00:11:35.000,00:11:39.520,"And I know that your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic, quite correctly, I'm afraid."
00:11:39.560,00:11:41.960,"That's enough to be going on with, don't you think?"
00:11:45.800,00:11:49.160,The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street.
00:11:49.200,00:11:50.440,Afternoon.
00:11:55.120,00:11:57.160,"Yeah, he's always like that."
00:13:02.520,00:13:03.720,Hello.
00:13:03.760,00:13:07.680,"-Ah, Mr Holmes."
00:13:07.720,00:13:09.920,"Well, this is a prime spot."
00:13:09.960,00:13:12.960,"Oh, Mrs Hudson, the landlady, she's given me a special deal."
00:13:13.000,00:13:14.680,Owes me a favour.
00:13:14.720,00:13:17.960,"Few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida."
00:13:18.000,00:13:19.200,I was able to help out.
00:13:19.240,00:13:21.840,"Sorry, you stopped her husband being executed?"
00:13:21.880,00:13:23.320,"Oh, no, I ensured it."
00:13:25.040,00:13:27.000,Sherlock!
00:13:27.040,00:13:28.480,"Mrs Hudson, Dr John Watson."
00:13:28.520,00:13:30.680,-Hello. Come in.
00:13:30.720,00:13:32.160,-Shall we?
00:13:57.680,00:14:00.080,"Well, this could be very nice."
00:14:02.560,00:14:03.640,Yes.
00:14:05.080,00:14:07.480,"Yes, I think so, my thoughts precisely."
00:14:07.520,00:14:08.760,So I went straight ahead and moved in.
00:14:07.520,00:14:10.240,-Soon as we get all this -rubbish cleaned out.
00:14:13.280,00:14:15.080,So this is all...
00:14:15.120,00:14:19.080,"Well, obviously I can, um, straighten things up a bit."
00:14:19.120,00:14:21.080,-That's a skull.
00:14:21.880,00:14:23.360,When I say friend...
00:14:23.400,00:14:26.520,"MRS HUDSON: What do you think, then, Dr Watson?"
00:14:26.560,00:14:30.600,"There's another bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing two bedrooms."
00:14:30.640,00:14:32.440,Of course we'll be needing two.
00:14:32.480,00:14:34.480,"Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts round here."
00:14:34.520,00:14:37.080,Mrs Turner next door's got married ones.
00:14:38.720,00:14:42.960,"Oh. Sherlock, the mess you've made."
00:14:50.840,00:14:52.200,I looked you up on the Internet last night.
00:14:54.760,00:14:56.120,Anything interesting?
00:14:56.160,00:14:58.960,Found your website.
00:14:59.000,00:15:00.680,-What did you think?
00:15:02.520,00:15:06.960,You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb?
00:15:07.000,00:15:08.680,Yes.
00:15:08.720,00:15:13.600,"And I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother's drinking habits on your mobile phone."
00:15:14.040,00:15:16.040,How?
00:15:16.080,00:15:18.840,"What about these suicides then, Sherlock?"
00:15:18.880,00:15:21.160,I thought that'd be right up your street.
00:15:21.200,00:15:23.760,-Three exactly the same.
00:15:23.800,00:15:24.840,Four.
00:15:26.600,00:15:29.320,There's been a fourth.
00:15:29.360,00:15:30.440,A fourth?
00:15:33.080,00:15:36.120,-Where?
00:15:36.160,00:15:37.800,What's new about this one?
00:15:36.160,00:15:39.000,You wouldn't have come to get me if it wasn't something different.
00:15:39.040,00:15:40.600,-You know how they never leave notes?
00:15:40.640,00:15:43.760,This one did.
00:15:43.800,00:15:45.480,-Who's on Forensics?
00:15:46.280,00:15:48.160,Anderson won't work with me.
00:15:48.200,00:15:50.720,"-Well, he won't be your assistant."
00:15:50.760,00:15:53.400,-Will you come?
00:15:54.280,00:15:55.600,Thank you.
00:16:04.000,00:16:06.320,Brilliant! Yes!
00:16:06.360,00:16:09.040,"Ah! Four serial suicides, and now a note."
00:16:09.080,00:16:13.280,"Oh, it's Christmas."
00:16:13.320,00:16:15.840,"I'm your landlady, dear, not your housekeeper."
00:16:15.880,00:16:17.200,Something cold will do.
00:16:17.240,00:16:19.800,"John, have a cup of tea, make yourself at home."
00:16:19.840,00:16:21.440,Don't wait up!
00:16:21.480,00:16:23.880,"Look at him, dashing about..."
00:16:23.920,00:16:26.360,My husband was just the same.
00:16:26.400,00:16:29.560,"But you're more the sitting-down type, I can tell."
00:16:31.080,00:16:33.000,"I'll make you that cuppa, you rest your leg."
00:16:33.040,00:16:35.960,Damn my leg!
00:16:36.000,00:16:38.560,It's just sometimes this bloody thing...
00:16:38.600,00:16:41.400,"I understand, dear, I've got a hip."
00:16:41.440,00:16:43.080,Cup of tea would be lovely.
00:16:43.120,00:16:45.520,"Just this once, dear, I'm not your housekeeper."
00:16:45.560,00:16:47.480,"Couple of biscuits too, if you've got 'em."
00:16:47.520,00:16:49.320,Not your housekeeper!
00:16:52.960,00:16:54.480,SHERLOCK: You're a doctor.
00:16:55.440,00:16:57.000,"In fact, you're an Army doctor."
00:17:00.720,00:17:01.800,Any good?
00:17:02.960,00:17:05.000,Very good.
00:17:05.040,00:17:08.080,"Seen a lot of injuries, then."
00:17:08.120,00:17:10.000,"Well, yes."
00:17:10.040,00:17:13.080,"-Bit of trouble too, I bet?"
00:17:13.120,00:17:15.640,"Enough for a lifetime, far too much."
00:17:16.760,00:17:18.760,-Want to see some more?
00:17:23.040,00:17:25.640,"JOHN: Sorry, Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the tea. Off out."
00:17:25.680,00:17:27.680,MRS HUDSON: Both of you?
00:17:27.720,00:17:29.960,Impossible suicides?
00:17:30.000,00:17:33.040,There's no point sitting at home when there's finally something fun going on!
00:17:33.080,00:17:35.160,"Look at you, all happy."
00:17:35.200,00:17:36.320,Who cares about decent?
00:17:36.360,00:17:38.520,"The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!"
00:17:44.480,00:17:45.600,Taxi!
00:18:22.920,00:18:25.160,"-Okay, you've got questions."
00:18:26.480,00:18:28.880,Crime scene. Next?
00:18:28.920,00:18:31.240,"-Who are you, what do you do?"
00:18:31.280,00:18:34.440,-I'd say private detective.
00:18:34.480,00:18:36.360,But the police don't go to private detectives.
00:18:37.280,00:18:39.320,I'm a consulting detective.
00:18:39.360,00:18:42.120,"-Only one in the world, I invented the job."
00:18:42.160,00:18:46.120,"Means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me."
00:18:46.160,00:18:48.160,The police don't consult amateurs.
00:18:51.080,00:18:54.200,"When I met you for the first time yesterday, I said Afghanistan or Iraq."
00:18:54.240,00:18:55.840,-You look surprised.
00:18:55.880,00:18:58.240,"I didn't know, I saw."
00:18:58.280,00:19:00.320,"SHERLOCK: Your haircut, the way you hold yourself says military."
00:19:00.360,00:19:02.360,And your conversation as you entered the room...
00:19:02.400,00:19:03.840,Bit different from my day.
00:19:03.880,00:19:06.320,"...Said trained at Barts, so Army doctor, obvious."
00:19:07.400,00:19:12.400,Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists.
00:19:12.440,00:19:18.800,"Your limp's really bad when you walk, but you don't ask for a chair when you stand like you've forgotten about it, so it's at least partly psychosomatic."
00:19:18.840,00:19:24.240,"That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic, wounded in action then."
00:19:24.280,00:19:25.560,Afghanistan or Iraq.
00:19:27.400,00:19:29.040,You said I had a therapist.
00:19:29.080,00:19:31.640,"You've got a psychosomatic limp, of course you've got a therapist."
00:19:31.680,00:19:33.600,-Then there's your brother.
00:19:33.640,00:19:36.080,"Your phone. It's expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player."
00:19:36.120,00:19:38.000,And you're looking for a flatshare. You wouldn't waste money on this.
00:19:38.040,00:19:39.160,"It's a gift, then."
00:19:39.200,00:19:41.360,Scratches.
00:19:39.200,00:19:43.200,"Not one, many over time, it's been in the same pocket as keys and coins."
00:19:43.240,00:19:46.720,"The man sitting next to me wouldn't treat his one luxury item like this, so it's had a previous owner."
00:19:46.760,00:19:48.080,Next bit's easy.
00:19:49.600,00:19:51.000,-The engraving?
00:19:51.040,00:19:53.160,Clearly a family member who's given you his old phone.
00:19:53.200,00:19:55.320,"Not your father, this is a young man's gadget."
00:19:55.360,00:19:58.400,"Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live."
00:19:58.440,00:20:01.280,"Unlikely you've got an extended family, certainly not one you're close to."
00:20:01.320,00:20:03.920,So brother it is.
00:20:03.960,00:20:05.720,Three kisses says it's a romantic attachment.
00:20:05.760,00:20:08.360,"The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend."
00:20:08.400,00:20:09.520,Must have given it to him recently.
00:20:09.560,00:20:11.440,This model's only six months old.
00:20:11.480,00:20:13.240,"Marriage in trouble then, six months on he's just given it away."
00:20:13.280,00:20:15.760,"If she'd left him, he would have kept it."
00:20:15.800,00:20:18.040,"No, he wanted rid of it."
00:20:18.080,00:20:20.440,He gave the phone to you.
00:20:20.480,00:20:24.280,You're looking for cheap accommodation and you're not going to your brother for help.
00:20:24.320,00:20:25.520,That says you've got problems with him.
00:20:25.560,00:20:27.120,Maybe you liked his wife.
00:20:27.160,00:20:28.600,Maybe you don't like his drinking.
00:20:28.640,00:20:32.840,How can you possibly know about the drinking?
00:20:32.880,00:20:34.440,Shot in the dark.
00:20:34.480,00:20:36.680,"Power connection, tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it."
00:20:36.720,00:20:39.320,Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking.
00:20:39.360,00:20:42.400,"You never see those marks on a sober man's phone, never see a drunks' without them."
00:20:42.440,00:20:43.600,There you go.
00:20:43.640,00:20:45.640,I was right?
00:20:45.680,00:20:48.080,The police don't consult amateurs.
00:20:50.560,00:20:53.720,That was amazing.
00:20:56.920,00:20:58.320,-You think so?
00:20:58.360,00:21:00.720,It was extraordinary.
00:21:00.760,00:21:02.000,That's not what people normally say.
00:21:02.040,00:21:03.640,What do people normally say?
00:21:03.680,00:21:04.960,Piss off!
00:21:17.120,00:21:18.640,Did I get anything wrong?
00:21:19.760,00:21:22.560,"Harry and me don't get on, never have."
00:21:22.600,00:21:29.560,"Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they're getting a divorce, and Harry is a drinker."
00:21:29.600,00:21:31.880,"Spot on, then."
00:21:31.920,00:21:33.960,Harry's short for Harriet.
00:21:35.040,00:21:36.400,Harry's your sister.
00:21:36.440,00:21:37.760,"Look, what exactly am I supposed to be doing here?"
00:21:37.800,00:21:38.920,Sister!
00:21:38.960,00:21:40.240,"No, seriously, what am I doing here?"
00:21:40.280,00:21:42.120,There's always something.
00:21:42.160,00:21:45.680,"-Hello, freak!"
00:21:45.720,00:21:47.320,Why?
00:21:47.360,00:21:48.720,I was invited.
00:21:48.760,00:21:50.480,-Why?
00:21:50.520,00:21:52.680,"-Well, you know what I think, don't you?"
00:21:54.200,00:21:55.720,I even know you didn't make it home last night.
00:21:57.120,00:21:58.160,I don't... Who's this?
00:21:58.200,00:21:59.920,"Colleague of mine, Dr Watson."
00:21:59.960,00:22:02.080,"Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan."
00:22:02.120,00:22:03.440,Old friend.
00:22:03.480,00:22:06.760,A colleague?
00:22:06.800,00:22:08.400,Did he follow you home?
00:22:08.440,00:22:10.160,-Would it be better if I just waited...
00:22:12.000,00:22:13.680,Freak's here. Bringing him in.
00:22:22.920,00:22:26.320,"Ah, Anderson."
00:22:26.360,00:22:29.720,It's a crime scene.
00:22:29.760,00:22:31.880,Quite clear.
00:22:31.920,00:22:33.760,And is your wife away for long?
00:22:33.800,00:22:36.160,"Oh, don't pretend you worked that out."
00:22:36.200,00:22:38.120,Your deodorant told me that.
00:22:38.160,00:22:40.600,-My deodorant?
00:22:40.640,00:22:42.560,"Well, of course it's for men."
00:22:42.600,00:22:43.680,So's Sergeant Donovan.
00:22:45.560,00:22:48.160,Ooh...
00:22:48.200,00:22:49.920,Whatever you're trying to imply...
00:22:49.960,00:22:51.200,I'm not implying anything.
00:22:51.240,00:22:55.840,"I'm sure Sally came round for a nice little chat, and just happened to stay over."
00:22:55.880,00:22:59.200,"And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees."
00:23:10.440,00:23:12.000,You'll need to wear one of these.
00:23:12.040,00:23:13.840,Who's this?
00:23:13.880,00:23:14.960,He's with me.
00:23:15.000,00:23:17.280,-But who is he?
00:23:19.880,00:23:21.520,Aren't you going to put one on?
00:23:24.880,00:23:26.960,-So where are we?
00:23:34.960,00:23:37.240,I can give you two minutes.
00:23:37.280,00:23:39.600,May need longer.
00:23:39.640,00:23:45.000,"Her name's Jennifer Wilson according to her credit cards, we're running them now for contact details."
00:23:45.040,00:23:46.800,Hasn't been here long.
00:23:46.840,00:23:48.600,Some kids found her.
00:24:20.880,00:24:22.120,Shut up.
00:24:23.680,00:24:25.520,-I didn't say anything.
00:25:38.360,00:25:39.520,Got anything?
00:25:41.560,00:25:42.600,Not much.
00:25:42.640,00:25:43.720,ANDERSON: She's German.
00:25:45.720,00:25:47.200,Rache.
00:25:47.240,00:25:48.400,She could be trying to tell us something...
00:25:48.440,00:25:50.920,"Yes, thank you for your input."
00:25:50.960,00:25:52.560,-LESTRADE: So she's German?
00:25:52.600,00:25:53.680,She's from out of town though.
00:25:53.720,00:25:57.200,Intended to stay in London for one night before returning home to Cardiff.
00:25:57.240,00:25:58.680,"So far, so obvious."
00:25:58.720,00:26:00.440,"-Sorry, obvious?"
00:26:00.480,00:26:02.640,"Dr Watson, what do you think?"
00:26:02.680,00:26:04.440,-Of the message?
00:26:04.480,00:26:06.240,We have a whole team right outside.
00:26:06.280,00:26:08.680,-They won't work with me.
00:26:08.720,00:26:10.160,"Yes, because you need me."
00:26:12.680,00:26:14.000,"Yes, I do."
00:26:14.840,00:26:16.400,God help me.
00:26:16.440,00:26:17.800,-Dr Watson!
00:26:19.480,00:26:21.000,"Oh, do as he says."
00:26:24.480,00:26:26.880,"Anderson, keep everyone out for a couple of minutes."
00:26:28.840,00:26:30.880,-Well?
00:26:30.920,00:26:32.160,Helping me make a point.
00:26:32.200,00:26:33.400,I'm supposed to be helping you pay the rent.
00:26:33.440,00:26:34.720,"Yeah, well, this is more fun."
00:26:34.760,00:26:37.520,Fun? There's a woman lying dead.
00:26:37.560,00:26:40.080,"Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you'd go deeper."
00:26:58.800,00:27:00.000,Yeah...
00:27:00.680,00:27:02.400,"Asphyxiation, probably."
00:27:02.440,00:27:04.240,"Passed out, choked on her own vomit."
00:27:04.280,00:27:05.920,Can't smell any alcohol on her.
00:27:05.960,00:27:07.800,It could have been a seizure.
00:27:07.840,00:27:10.600,"You know what it was, you've read the papers."
00:27:10.640,00:27:12.560,"Well, she's one of the suicides."
00:27:12.600,00:27:15.320,"Sherlock, two minutes, I said, I need anything you got."
00:27:15.360,00:27:18.400,Victim is in her late 30s.
00:27:18.440,00:27:21.880,"I'm guessing something in the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink."
00:27:21.920,00:27:24.600,Travelled from Cardiff today intending to stay in London one night.
00:27:24.640,00:27:26.160,It's obvious from the size of her suitcase.
00:27:26.200,00:27:27.720,-Suitcase?
00:27:27.760,00:27:30.320,"She's been married at least 10 years, but not happily."
00:27:30.360,00:27:33.200,She's had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was married.
00:27:33.240,00:27:35.240,"Oh, for God's sake, if you're just making this up..."
00:27:35.280,00:27:37.840,Her wedding ring.
00:27:37.880,00:27:40.680,"The rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned, but not her wedding ring."
00:27:40.720,00:27:42.160,State of her marriage right there.
00:27:42.200,00:27:43.960,The inside is shinier than the outside.
00:27:44.000,00:27:45.840,That means it's regularly removed.
00:27:45.880,00:27:47.800,The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger.
00:27:47.840,00:27:49.200,"It's not for work, look at her nails."
00:27:49.240,00:27:53.080,She doesn't work with her hands so what or rather who does she remove her rings for?
00:27:53.120,00:27:58.000,"Clearly not one lover, she'd never sustain the fiction of being single over that amount of time, so more likely a string of them."
00:27:58.040,00:27:59.440,Brilliant.
00:27:59.480,00:28:01.240,-Sorry.
00:28:01.280,00:28:02.560,"It's obvious, isn't it?"
00:28:03.240,00:28:05.360,It's not obvious to me.
00:28:05.400,00:28:08.840,"Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains, it must be so boring."
00:28:08.880,00:28:10.520,Her coat.
00:28:10.560,00:28:12.200,She's been in heavy rain the last few hours.
00:28:12.240,00:28:14.320,No rain anywhere in London in that time.
00:28:14.360,00:28:16.040,Under her coat collar is damp too.
00:28:16.080,00:28:18.040,She's turned it up against the wind.
00:28:18.080,00:28:20.520,She's got an umbrella in her left hand pocket but it's dry and unused.
00:28:20.560,00:28:23.000,"Not just wind, strong wind, too strong to use her umbrella."
00:28:23.040,00:28:30.080,"We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight so she must have come a decent distance, but she can't have travelled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn't dried."
00:28:30.120,00:28:34.440,"So, where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time?"
00:28:34.480,00:28:36.000,Cardiff.
00:28:36.040,00:28:38.120,-Fantastic.
00:28:38.160,00:28:40.760,"-Sorry, I'll shut up."
00:28:40.800,00:28:43.760,-Why do you keep saying suitcase?
00:28:43.800,00:28:46.080,She must have had a phone or an organiser.
00:28:46.120,00:28:48.680,-Find out who Rachel is.
00:28:48.720,00:28:50.920,"No, she was leaving an angry note in German."
00:28:50.960,00:28:53.160,"Of course she was writing Rachel, no other word it can be."
00:28:53.200,00:28:55.640,"Question is, why did she wait until she was dying to write it?"
00:28:55.680,00:28:57.280,How do you know she had a suitcase?
00:28:57.320,00:28:59.280,Back of her right leg.
00:28:59.320,00:29:01.160,Tiny splash marks on the right heel and calf not present on the left.
00:29:01.200,00:29:03.280,She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand.
00:29:03.320,00:29:05.000,Don't get that splash pattern any other way.
00:29:05.040,00:29:07.080,"Smallish case, going by the spread."
00:29:07.120,00:29:11.320,"Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious, could only be an overnight bag so we know she was staying one night."
00:29:11.360,00:29:13.400,"Where is it, what have you done with it?"
00:29:13.440,00:29:14.840,There wasn't a case.
00:29:17.320,00:29:18.960,Say that again.
00:29:19.000,00:29:21.200,There wasn't a case.
00:29:21.240,00:29:23.600,Suitcase!
00:29:23.640,00:29:25.440,Was there a suitcase in this house?
00:29:25.480,00:29:27.120,"Sherlock, there's no case!"
00:29:27.160,00:29:28.600,But they take the poison themselves.
00:29:28.640,00:29:30.200,"They chew, swallow the pills themselves."
00:29:30.240,00:29:32.080,"There are clear signs, even you lot couldn't miss them."
00:29:32.120,00:29:34.240,"Right, yeah, thanks. And?"
00:29:34.280,00:29:36.520,"It's murder, all of them."
00:29:36.560,00:29:39.280,But they're not suicides.
00:29:39.320,00:29:40.920,We've got a serial killer.
00:29:40.960,00:29:42.480,There's always something to look forward to.
00:29:42.520,00:29:44.640,-Why are you saying that?
00:29:44.680,00:29:47.040,"Come on, where is her case?"
00:29:47.080,00:29:49.120,"Someone else was here, and they took her case."
00:29:50.520,00:29:52.000,So the killer must have driven here.
00:29:52.040,00:29:53.520,Forgot the case was in the car.
00:29:53.560,00:29:55.680,"She could have checked into a hotel, left her case there."
00:29:55.720,00:29:58.040,"No, she never got to the hotel."
00:29:58.080,00:29:59.760,She colour-coordinates her lipstick and her shoes.
00:29:59.800,00:30:02.360,She'd never have left any hotel with her hair still looking...
00:30:03.520,00:30:04.640,Oh...
00:30:06.000,00:30:07.320,Oh!
00:30:07.360,00:30:09.120,-Sherlock?
00:30:09.160,00:30:11.120,"Serial killers, always hard."
00:30:11.160,00:30:13.160,You have to wait for them to make a mistake.
00:30:13.200,00:30:15.400,-We can't just wait!
00:30:15.440,00:30:18.160,"Houston, we have a mistake."
00:30:18.200,00:30:19.960,Find out who Jennifer Wilson's family and friends were.
00:30:20.000,00:30:21.200,Find Rachel!
00:30:21.240,00:30:23.040,"Of course, yeah, but what mistake?"
00:30:24.520,00:30:25.640,Pink!
00:30:27.960,00:30:29.760,ANDERSON: Let's get on with it.
00:31:07.280,00:31:09.400,-He's gone.
00:31:09.440,00:31:11.600,"Yeah, he just took off."
00:31:11.640,00:31:13.600,-Is he coming back?
00:31:14.680,00:31:16.360,Right.
00:31:17.640,00:31:18.800,Right.
00:31:21.240,00:31:23.480,"Yes. Sorry, where am I?"
00:31:23.520,00:31:25.200,Brixton.
00:31:25.240,00:31:27.320,Uh... Do you know where I could get a cab?
00:31:27.880,00:31:29.400,It's just uh...
00:31:30.120,00:31:31.320,Well...
00:31:31.760,00:31:32.960,My leg.
00:31:33.720,00:31:34.840,Uh...
00:31:36.400,00:31:38.200,Try the main road.
00:31:38.240,00:31:39.760,Thanks.
00:31:39.800,00:31:41.200,But you're not his friend.
00:31:42.160,00:31:44.120,He doesn't have friends.
00:31:45.560,00:31:47.080,So who are you?
00:31:47.120,00:31:49.960,I'm... I'm nobody.
00:31:50.000,00:31:51.960,A bit of advice then.
00:31:52.000,00:31:53.080,Why?
00:31:55.840,00:31:57.000,You know why he's here?
00:31:59.360,00:32:01.480,He's not paid or anything.
00:32:01.520,00:32:04.800,He likes it.
00:32:04.840,00:32:07.360,"The weirder the crime, the more he gets off."
00:32:09.280,00:32:11.520,One day just showing up won't be enough.
00:32:11.560,00:32:14.680,One day we'll be standing round a body and Sherlock Holmes will be the one that put it there.
00:32:14.720,00:32:17.320,-Why would he do that?
00:32:17.960,00:32:19.960,Psychopaths get bored.
00:32:20.000,00:32:22.080,-LESTRADE: Donovan!
00:32:26.240,00:32:28.520,Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.
00:32:59.040,00:33:00.600,Taxi! Taxi!
00:33:36.440,00:33:38.280,Hello?
00:33:38.320,00:33:40.840,MAN: There is a security camera on the building to your left.
00:33:41.440,00:33:42.920,Do you see it?
00:33:46.800,00:33:48.160,Who's this?
00:33:49.520,00:33:51.040,Who's speaking?
00:33:51.080,00:33:53.400,"Do you see the camera, Dr Watson?"
00:33:55.320,00:33:56.840,"-Yeah, I see it."
00:34:02.080,00:34:05.320,There is another camera on the building opposite you.
00:34:05.920,00:34:07.160,Mmm-hmm.
00:34:09.240,00:34:12.680,"And finally, at the top of the building on your right."
00:34:20.400,00:34:21.840,How are you doing this?
00:34:21.880,00:34:24.840,"MAN: Get into the car, Dr Watson."
00:34:24.880,00:34:29.880,"I would make some sort of threat, but I'm sure your situation is quite clear to you."
00:34:46.800,00:34:48.480,-Hello.
00:34:54.600,00:34:56.400,"What's your name, then?"
00:34:56.440,00:34:58.200,Uh... Anthea.
00:34:59.160,00:35:01.440,Is that your real name?
00:35:01.480,00:35:02.520,No.
00:35:06.480,00:35:07.800,I'm John.
00:35:07.840,00:35:09.240,Yes. I know.
00:35:13.280,00:35:15.280,Any point in asking where I'm going?
00:35:18.760,00:35:20.240,None at all...
00:35:20.800,00:35:21.920,John.
00:35:23.600,00:35:24.720,Okay.
00:35:43.880,00:35:45.560,"Have a seat, John."
00:35:50.240,00:35:53.320,"You know, I've got a phone."
00:35:53.360,00:35:58.000,"I mean, very clever and all that, but uh..."
00:35:58.040,00:36:00.000,You could just phone me.
00:36:00.880,00:36:02.360,On my phone.
00:36:04.840,00:36:09.880,"When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock Holmes, one learns to be discreet, hence this place."
00:36:09.920,00:36:12.160,Your leg must be hurting you.
00:36:12.200,00:36:14.320,-Sit down.
00:36:16.200,00:36:18.040,You don't seem very afraid.
00:36:18.080,00:36:19.400,You don't seem very frightening.
00:36:21.960,00:36:25.080,The bravery of the soldier.
00:36:25.120,00:36:28.880,"Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don't you think?"
00:36:28.920,00:36:32.120,What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?
00:36:32.160,00:36:35.280,I don't have one.
00:36:36.880,00:36:38.040,-Yesterday.
00:36:38.080,00:36:41.920,And since yesterday you've moved in with him and now you're solving crimes together.
00:36:41.960,00:36:45.160,Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?
00:36:45.200,00:36:47.760,-Who are you?
00:36:47.800,00:36:49.680,Interested in Sherlock? Why?
00:36:49.720,00:36:51.840,I'm guessing you're not friends.
00:36:51.880,00:36:56.360,You've met him.
00:36:56.400,00:37:00.240,I am the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.
00:37:00.280,00:37:01.440,-And what's that?
00:37:01.480,00:37:02.640,An enemy?
00:37:02.680,00:37:04.400,"In his mind, certainly."
00:37:04.440,00:37:07.240,"If you were to ask him, he'd probably say his arch-enemy."
00:37:08.040,00:37:10.720,He does love to be dramatic.
00:37:10.760,00:37:12.200,"Well, thank God you're above all that."
00:37:18.800,00:37:21.680,I hope I'm not distracting you.
00:37:21.720,00:37:23.560,Not distracting me at all.
00:37:23.600,00:37:26.240,Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?
00:37:26.280,00:37:29.840,"I could be wrong, but I think that's none of your business."
00:37:29.880,00:37:31.640,-It could be.
00:37:33.080,00:37:35.120,"If you do move into, um..."
00:37:37.760,00:37:48.600,"221B Baker Street, I'd be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way."
00:37:48.640,00:37:50.240,Why?
00:37:50.280,00:37:51.440,Because you're not a wealthy man.
00:37:51.480,00:37:53.000,In exchange for what?
00:37:53.880,00:37:55.800,Information.
00:37:55.840,00:37:59.520,Nothing indiscreet.
00:37:59.560,00:38:01.960,-Just tell me what he's up to.
00:38:02.680,00:38:05.160,I worry about him.
00:38:05.200,00:38:06.760,Constantly.
00:38:06.800,00:38:08.640,That's nice of you.
00:38:08.680,00:38:12.640,But I would prefer for various reasons that my concern go unmentioned.
00:38:12.680,00:38:14.680,We have what you might call a...
00:38:14.720,00:38:16.320,Difficult relationship.
00:38:23.520,00:38:25.560,-No.
00:38:25.600,00:38:27.120,-Don't bother.
00:38:27.160,00:38:29.360,You're very loyal very quickly.
00:38:29.400,00:38:31.560,"No, I'm not."
00:38:36.480,00:38:39.080,"Trust issues, it says here."
00:38:42.760,00:38:44.000,What's that?
00:38:44.040,00:38:47.840,Could it be that you've decided to trust Sherlock Holmes of all people?
00:38:47.880,00:38:49.320,Who says I trust him?
00:38:49.360,00:38:50.960,You don't seem the kind to make friends easily.
00:38:51.000,00:38:52.400,Are we done?
00:38:53.520,00:38:54.760,You tell me.
00:39:02.000,00:39:08.040,"I imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him, but I can see from your left hand that's not going to happen."
00:39:11.600,00:39:13.280,-My what?
00:39:25.120,00:39:26.280,Don't.
00:39:34.000,00:39:35.840,-Remarkable.
00:39:35.880,00:39:43.120,"Most people blunder round this city, and all they see are streets and shops and cars."
00:39:43.160,00:39:46.120,"When you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield."
00:39:46.160,00:39:48.160,You've seen it already.
00:39:48.200,00:39:50.200,What's wrong with my hand?
00:39:50.240,00:39:54.000,You have an intermittent tremor in your left hand.
00:39:54.040,00:39:56.960,Your therapist thinks it's post-traumatic stress disorder.
00:39:57.000,00:39:59.880,She thinks you're haunted by memories of your military service.
00:39:59.920,00:40:01.440,Who the hell are you?
00:40:03.000,00:40:05.120,-How do you know that?
00:40:05.160,00:40:07.120,She's got it the wrong way round.
00:40:07.160,00:40:10.240,You're under stress right now and your hand is perfectly steady.
00:40:12.280,00:40:14.720,"You're not haunted by the war, Dr Watson..."
00:40:16.160,00:40:17.560,You miss it.
00:40:28.040,00:40:30.520,"Time to choose a side, Dr Watson."
00:40:40.600,00:40:42.400,I'm to take you home.
00:40:52.520,00:40:53.680,Address?
00:40:53.720,00:40:55.720,"Uh, Baker Street."
00:40:55.760,00:40:57.800,221B Baker Street.
00:40:59.520,00:41:01.560,But I need to stop off somewhere first.
00:41:29.360,00:41:31.040,"Listen, your boss."
00:41:31.080,00:41:32.840,Any chance you could not tell him this is where I went?
00:41:33.360,00:41:34.520,Sure.
00:41:34.560,00:41:36.240,"You've told him already, haven't you?"
00:41:36.280,00:41:37.400,Yeah.
00:41:41.280,00:41:44.960,Hey um...
00:41:45.000,00:41:47.160,"Oh, yeah. Lots."
00:41:53.120,00:41:54.560,-Bye...
00:42:22.800,00:42:24.320,What are you doing?
00:42:24.360,00:42:25.480,Nicotine patch.
00:42:27.400,00:42:29.160,Helps me think.
00:42:29.200,00:42:32.200,Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days.
00:42:33.080,00:42:34.560,Bad news for brain work.
00:42:34.600,00:42:36.000,-It's good news for breathing.
00:42:36.040,00:42:37.560,Breathing! Breathing's boring.
00:42:37.600,00:42:39.360,Is that three patches?
00:42:39.400,00:42:41.200,It's a three-patch problem.
00:42:45.400,00:42:46.520,Well?
00:42:49.440,00:42:51.520,"You asked me to come, I'm assuming it's important."
00:42:52.880,00:42:54.680,"Oh. Yeah, of course."
00:42:56.000,00:42:57.600,-My phone?
00:42:57.640,00:42:58.840,Always a chance that my number will be recognised.
00:42:58.880,00:43:00.320,It's on the website.
00:43:00.360,00:43:01.840,-Mrs Hudson's got a phone.
00:43:01.880,00:43:03.240,I tried shouting but she didn't hear.
00:43:03.280,00:43:04.520,I was the other side of London...
00:43:04.560,00:43:06.280,-There was no hurry.
00:43:09.680,00:43:10.800,Here.
00:43:15.880,00:43:17.520,So what's this about.
00:43:17.560,00:43:19.200,Her case...
00:43:19.240,00:43:22.240,-Her case?
00:43:22.280,00:43:24.760,"The murderer took her suitcase, first big mistake."
00:43:25.720,00:43:27.640,"Okay, he took her case. So?"
00:43:27.680,00:43:29.520,"It's no use, there's no other way."
00:43:31.120,00:43:33.600,On my desk there's a number.
00:43:36.400,00:43:39.040,You've brought me here to send a text.
00:43:39.080,00:43:40.520,"Text, yes."
00:43:52.720,00:43:55.360,-What's wrong?
00:43:55.400,00:43:57.520,-A friend?
00:43:57.560,00:43:58.760,Oh. Which one?
00:44:00.720,00:44:02.680,"Well, your arch-enemy, according to him."
00:44:02.720,00:44:04.040,Do people have arch-enemies?
00:44:06.080,00:44:07.600,Did he offer you money to spy on me?
00:44:08.880,00:44:11.120,-Yes.
00:44:11.160,00:44:12.760,-No.
00:44:12.800,00:44:14.160,Think it through next time.
00:44:14.640,00:44:16.360,Who is he?
00:44:16.400,00:44:18.800,"The most dangerous man you've ever met, and not my problem right now."
00:44:18.840,00:44:20.520,"On my desk, the number!"
00:44:27.800,00:44:29.720,Jennifer Wilson. That was...
00:44:29.760,00:44:31.920,Hang on.
00:44:31.960,00:44:34.920,Yes. That's not important.
00:44:34.960,00:44:36.560,-Are you doing it?
00:44:36.600,00:44:38.480,-Have you done it?
00:44:39.880,00:44:42.520,These words exactly.
00:44:42.560,00:44:45.720,What happened at Lauriston Gardens?
00:44:45.760,00:44:47.800,I must have blacked out.
00:44:47.840,00:44:50.920,22 Northumberland St.
00:44:50.960,00:44:52.520,-Please come.
00:44:52.560,00:44:54.920,What? No... No!
00:44:54.960,00:44:57.360,Type and send it. Quickly.
00:45:02.960,00:45:04.480,-Have you sent it?
00:45:04.520,00:45:06.760,22 Northumberland St.
00:45:14.280,00:45:16.440,That's...
00:45:16.480,00:45:19.440,"That's the pink lady's case, that's Jennifer Wilson's case."
00:45:19.480,00:45:20.720,"Yes, obviously."
00:45:23.640,00:45:26.480,"Oh, perhaps I should mention, I didn't kill her."
00:45:26.520,00:45:28.080,-I never said you did.
00:45:28.120,00:45:31.720,Given that text I just had you send and the fact I have her case it's a perfectly logical assumption.
00:45:31.760,00:45:33.720,Do people usually assume you're the murderer?
00:45:35.200,00:45:36.400,"Now and then, yes."
00:45:37.840,00:45:39.040,Okay...
00:45:41.200,00:45:43.280,-How did you get this?
00:45:43.320,00:45:44.760,Where?
00:45:44.800,00:45:46.440,The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens.
00:45:46.480,00:45:49.200,He could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car.
00:45:49.240,00:45:54.800,"Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention to themselves, particularly a man, which is statistically more likely."
00:45:54.840,00:45:56.360,So obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it.
00:45:56.400,00:46:01.040,"The moment he noticed he still had it, wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake."
00:46:01.080,00:46:07.280,"I checked every backstreet wide enough for a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens, and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed."
00:46:09.560,00:46:11.640,Took me less than an hour to find the right skip.
00:46:14.160,00:46:17.120,Pink. You got all that because you realised the case would be pink?
00:46:17.160,00:46:18.680,"Well, it had to be pink, obviously."
00:46:18.720,00:46:21.000,-Why didn't I think of that?
00:46:21.040,00:46:23.600,"No, no, no, don't look like that."
00:46:23.640,00:46:26.080,"Now, look."
00:46:26.120,00:46:28.400,From the case? How could I?
00:46:28.440,00:46:30.520,Her phone.
00:46:30.560,00:46:32.320,"There was no phone on the body, there's no phone in the case."
00:46:32.360,00:46:34.440,We know she had one.
00:46:34.480,00:46:36.000,Maybe she left it at home.
00:46:36.040,00:46:38.240,She has a string of lovers and she's careful about it.
00:46:38.280,00:46:40.360,She never leaves her phone at home.
00:46:41.480,00:46:42.600,Uh...
00:46:44.040,00:46:46.160,Why did I just send that text?
00:46:46.200,00:46:49.240,"Well, the question is where is her phone now?"
00:46:49.280,00:46:51.560,-She could have lost it.
00:46:53.280,00:46:56.320,The murderer...
00:46:56.360,00:46:59.640,Maybe she left it when she left her case.
00:46:59.680,00:47:02.360,Maybe he took it from her for some reason.
00:47:02.400,00:47:05.480,"Either way, the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone."
00:47:05.520,00:47:07.640,Sorry. What are we doing?
00:47:07.680,00:47:09.960,Did I just text a murderer?
00:47:13.840,00:47:18.360,"A few hours after his last victim, and now he receives a text that can only be from her."
00:47:20.800,00:47:24.480,"If somebody had just found that phone they'd ignore a text like that, but the murderer..."
00:47:26.200,00:47:27.600,Would panic.
00:47:29.960,00:47:31.440,Have you talked to the police?
00:47:31.480,00:47:33.120,"Four people are dead, there isn't time to talk to the police."
00:47:33.160,00:47:34.640,So why are you talking to me?
00:47:34.680,00:47:36.360,Mrs Hudson took my skull.
00:47:38.120,00:47:39.600,So I'm basically filling in for your skull?
00:47:39.640,00:47:40.840,"Relax, you're doing fine."
00:47:41.600,00:47:43.400,-Well?
00:47:43.440,00:47:46.200,"Well, you could just sit there and watch telly."
00:47:46.240,00:47:48.160,"What, you want me to come with you?"
00:47:48.200,00:47:50.720,"I like company when I go out, and I think better when I talk aloud."
00:47:50.760,00:47:52.120,"The skull just attracts attention, so..."
00:47:53.960,00:47:56.400,-Problem?
00:47:56.440,00:47:59.040,-What about her?
00:47:59.080,00:48:02.040,You get off on this.
00:48:02.080,00:48:05.200,"And I said dangerous, and here you are."
00:48:09.440,00:48:10.680,Damn it!
00:48:19.800,00:48:21.080,Where are we going?
00:48:21.120,00:48:22.840,Northumberland St's a five minute walk from here.
00:48:22.880,00:48:24.400,You think he's stupid enough to go there?
00:48:24.440,00:48:26.320,"No, I think he's brilliant enough."
00:48:26.360,00:48:29.560,I love the brilliant ones.
00:48:29.600,00:48:31.720,-Why?
00:48:31.760,00:48:34.760,Applause!
00:48:34.800,00:48:36.920,"That's the frailty of genius, John, it needs an audience."
00:48:36.960,00:48:38.840,Yeah.
00:48:38.880,00:48:42.480,This is his hunting ground.
00:48:42.520,00:48:45.880,"Now that we know his victims were abducted, that changes everything."
00:48:45.920,00:48:51.880,"Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places, but nobody saw them go."
00:48:51.920,00:48:55.040,"Think! Who do we trust, even though we don't know them?"
00:48:55.080,00:48:58.520,Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?
00:48:58.560,00:49:00.880,Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?
00:49:00.920,00:49:02.880,Don't know. Who?
00:49:02.920,00:49:05.120,Haven't the faintest. Hungry?
00:49:08.920,00:49:10.560,"Thank you, Billy."
00:49:14.400,00:49:16.040,22 Northumberland St.
00:49:16.080,00:49:18.800,Keep your eyes on it.
00:49:18.840,00:49:21.960,He's not just going to ring the doorbell.
00:49:22.000,00:49:24.280,He has killed four people.
00:49:24.320,00:49:25.440,Okay.
00:49:27.400,00:49:28.760,Sherlock!
00:49:28.800,00:49:31.720,"Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free."
00:49:31.760,00:49:33.840,"On the house, for you and for your date."
00:49:33.880,00:49:35.320,-Do you want to eat?
00:49:35.360,00:49:37.560,This man got me off a murder charge.
00:49:37.600,00:49:38.680,This is Angelo.
00:49:38.720,00:49:45.360,"Three years ago I proved to Lestrade at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder that Angelo was in a completely different part of town, house-breaking."
00:49:45.400,00:49:47.320,-He cleared my name.
00:49:47.360,00:49:50.120,-Anything happening opposite?
00:49:50.160,00:49:51.840,"But for this man, I'd have gone to prison."
00:49:51.880,00:49:53.400,You did go to prison.
00:49:53.440,00:49:55.360,I'll get a candle for the table.
00:49:55.400,00:49:57.040,I'm not his date!
00:49:59.200,00:50:01.160,You may as well eat.
00:50:02.840,00:50:04.120,Thanks.
00:50:11.680,00:50:13.480,People don't have arch-enemies.
00:50:15.040,00:50:17.600,-I'm sorry?
00:50:17.640,00:50:20.200,There are no arch-enemies in real life. Doesn't happen.
00:50:20.240,00:50:22.920,Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull.
00:50:22.960,00:50:24.400,So who did I meet?
00:50:24.440,00:50:27.920,"What do real people have, then, in their real lives?"
00:50:29.080,00:50:30.680,Friends?
00:50:30.720,00:50:35.080,"People they know, people they like, people they don't like."
00:50:35.120,00:50:37.760,"-Girlfriends, boyfriends."
00:50:39.320,00:50:41.040,"You don't have a girlfriend, then."
00:50:41.080,00:50:43.520,Girlfriend?
00:50:43.560,00:50:44.640,Mmm.
00:50:46.160,00:50:48.720,"Oh, right."
00:50:48.760,00:50:51.120,Do you have a boyfriend?
00:50:51.160,00:50:52.800,I know it's fine.
00:50:54.840,00:50:56.360,-So you've got a boyfriend then.
00:50:59.800,00:51:02.080,You're unattached.
00:51:12.560,00:51:15.360,"John, um..."
00:51:15.400,00:51:19.640,"I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I'm flattered, I'm really not looking for any..."
00:51:19.680,00:51:23.240,"No, I'm...not asking. No."
00:51:24.640,00:51:27.120,"I'm just saying, it's all fine."
00:51:29.920,00:51:31.040,Good.
00:51:32.560,00:51:33.880,Thank you.
00:51:36.200,00:51:39.120,Look across the street.
00:51:39.160,00:51:40.920,"Nobody getting in, and nobody getting out."
00:51:42.040,00:51:44.440,Why a taxi?
00:51:44.480,00:51:46.600,"Oh, that's clever."
00:51:46.640,00:51:48.040,That's him.
00:51:48.080,00:51:50.280,-Don't stare.
00:51:50.320,00:51:52.080,We can't both stare.
00:52:15.800,00:52:17.520,Sorry.
00:52:17.560,00:52:21.040,-I've got the cab number.
00:52:21.080,00:52:25.400,"Right turn, one way, roadworks, traffic lights, bus lane, pedestrian crossing, left turn only, traffic lights."
00:52:31.360,00:52:32.520,-Sorry.
00:52:42.960,00:52:44.080,"Come on, John."
00:53:03.160,00:53:04.880,"Come on, John."
00:53:33.600,00:53:35.320,Oh! This way.
00:53:36.440,00:53:37.920,"No, this way!"
00:53:37.960,00:53:39.120,Sorry.
00:54:04.680,00:54:06.480,Police! Open her up.
00:54:10.480,00:54:11.880,No...
00:54:11.920,00:54:13.680,"Teeth, tan. What, Californian?"
00:54:15.040,00:54:17.560,"LA, Santa Monica."
00:54:17.600,00:54:20.720,-How could you possibly know that?
00:54:20.760,00:54:23.680,"Ah, probably your first trip to London, right?"
00:54:23.720,00:54:26.720,Going by your final destination and the route the cabbie was taking you.
00:54:26.760,00:54:28.560,"Sorry, are you guys the police?"
00:54:28.600,00:54:30.680,Yeah. Everything all right?
00:54:31.600,00:54:32.720,Yeah.
00:54:34.280,00:54:35.640,Welcome to London.
00:54:37.920,00:54:39.760,"Uh, any problems, just let us know."
00:54:44.240,00:54:46.040,Basically just a cab that happened to slow down.
00:54:46.080,00:54:47.160,Basically.
00:54:47.200,00:54:49.120,-Not the murderer.
00:54:49.160,00:54:51.160,"Wrong country, good alibi."
00:54:51.200,00:54:53.880,-As they go.
00:54:53.920,00:54:56.600,Detective Inspector Lestrade?
00:54:56.640,00:54:59.000,Yeah. I pickpocket him when he's annoying.
00:54:59.040,00:55:00.520,"You can keep that one, I've got plenty at the flat."
00:55:03.160,00:55:04.480,What?
00:55:04.520,00:55:06.600,"Nothing, just..."
00:55:10.040,00:55:11.560,SHERLOCK: Got your breath back?
00:55:11.600,00:55:13.240,Ready when you are.
00:55:22.840,00:55:24.480,That was ridiculous.
00:55:24.520,00:55:27.760,That was the most ridiculous thing I've ever done.
00:55:27.800,00:55:29.360,And you invaded Afghanistan.
00:55:32.400,00:55:34.040,That wasn't just me.
00:55:34.080,00:55:35.760,Why aren't we back at the restaurant?
00:55:35.800,00:55:37.280,They can keep an eye out.
00:55:38.200,00:55:40.160,It was a long shot anyway.
00:55:40.200,00:55:42.320,So what were we doing there?
00:55:45.080,00:55:47.600,"Oh, just passing the time."
00:55:47.640,00:55:49.400,And proving a point.
00:55:49.440,00:55:50.720,-What point?
00:55:50.760,00:55:54.800,Mrs Hudson! Dr Watson will take the room upstairs.
00:55:54.840,00:55:56.400,Says who?
00:55:56.440,00:55:57.800,Says the man at the door.
00:56:08.480,00:56:10.440,Sherlock texted me.
00:56:10.480,00:56:11.800,He said you forgot this.
00:56:13.600,00:56:14.760,Ah.
00:56:17.000,00:56:18.640,"Er, thank you. Thank you."
00:56:20.440,00:56:22.120,"Sherlock, what have you done?"
00:56:22.160,00:56:24.120,-Mrs Hudson?
00:56:30.360,00:56:31.800,SHERLOCK: What are you doing?
00:56:31.840,00:56:33.480,"Well, I knew you'd find the case, I'm not stupid."
00:56:33.520,00:56:35.360,You can't just break into my flat.
00:56:35.400,00:56:37.560,"You can't withhold evidence, and I didn't break into your flat."
00:56:37.600,00:56:38.800,"Well, what do you call this, then?"
00:56:39.840,00:56:41.040,It's a drugs bust.
00:56:41.080,00:56:43.480,Seriously?
00:56:43.520,00:56:44.560,Have you met him?
00:56:44.600,00:56:46.040,John.
00:56:46.080,00:56:49.480,"I'm pretty sure you could search this flat all day, you wouldn't find anything you could call recreational."
00:56:49.520,00:56:50.920,"John, you probably want to shut up now."
00:56:50.960,00:56:52.080,But come on.
00:56:54.080,00:56:55.360,-No.
00:56:55.400,00:56:56.560,You?
00:56:56.600,00:56:58.920,Shut up!
00:56:58.960,00:57:00.080,"No, Anderson's my sniffer dog."
00:57:00.120,00:57:02.480,What? I...
00:57:02.520,00:57:04.800,"Anderson, what are you doing here on a drugs bust?"
00:57:04.840,00:57:06.680,"Oh, I volunteered."
00:57:06.720,00:57:09.680,"They all did. They're not strictly speaking on the drug squad, but they're very keen."
00:57:09.720,00:57:11.640,-Are these human eyes?
00:57:11.680,00:57:12.920,They were in the microwave.
00:57:12.960,00:57:14.080,It's an experiment.
00:57:14.120,00:57:15.600,"Keep looking, guys."
00:57:15.640,00:57:17.800,Or you could help us properly and I'll stand them down.
00:57:17.840,00:57:20.000,-This is childish.
00:57:20.040,00:57:24.000,"Sherlock, this is our case."
00:57:24.440,00:57:25.960,Clear?
00:57:26.000,00:57:28.240,"What, so you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me?"
00:57:28.280,00:57:30.040,It stops being pretend if they find anything.
00:57:30.080,00:57:31.520,I am clean!
00:57:31.560,00:57:33.800,ANDERSON: Is your flat?
00:57:33.840,00:57:35.440,Don't even smoke.
00:57:36.160,00:57:37.520,Neither do I.
00:57:39.920,00:57:41.280,So let's work together.
00:57:42.520,00:57:44.320,-We've found Rachel.
00:57:44.360,00:57:45.680,Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.
00:57:46.240,00:57:47.880,Her daughter?
00:57:47.920,00:57:50.080,Why would she write her daughter's name? Why?
00:57:50.120,00:57:52.280,"Never mind that, we found the case."
00:57:52.320,00:57:57.560,"According to someone the murderer has the case, and we found it in the hands of our favourite psychopath."
00:57:57.600,00:57:59.240,"I'm not a psychopath, Anderson."
00:57:59.280,00:58:01.480,I am a high-functioning sociopath.
00:58:01.520,00:58:04.240,"You need to bring Rachel in, you need to question her."
00:58:04.280,00:58:05.800,-She's dead.
00:58:05.840,00:58:07.320,Is there a connection?
00:58:07.360,00:58:09.680,"Well, I doubt it, since she's been dead for 14 years."
00:58:09.720,00:58:12.040,Technically she was never alive.
00:58:12.080,00:58:15.960,"Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's stillborn daughter, 14 years ago."
00:58:16.720,00:58:17.920,"SHERLOCK: No, that's..."
00:58:18.880,00:58:20.920,That's not right. How?
00:58:20.960,00:58:22.920,Why would she do that? Why?
00:58:22.960,00:58:25.120,Why would she think of her daughter in her last moments?
00:58:25.160,00:58:27.400,"Yup, sociopath, I'm seeing it now."
00:58:27.440,00:58:29.360,She didn't think about her daughter.
00:58:29.400,00:58:33.120,She scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails.
00:58:33.160,00:58:35.240,"It took effort, it would have hurt."
00:58:35.280,00:58:40.080,"You said that the victims all took the poison themselves, that he makes them take it."
00:58:40.120,00:58:42.840,"Well, maybe he..."
00:58:42.880,00:58:45.200,Maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow.
00:58:45.240,00:58:47.400,"Yeah, but that was ages ago."
00:58:51.440,00:58:52.560,Not good?
00:58:53.520,00:58:54.840,"Bit not good, yeah."
00:58:54.880,00:58:56.680,If you were dying...
00:58:56.720,00:58:59.120,"If you'd been murdered in your very last few seconds, what would you say?"
00:58:59.160,00:59:00.640,"Please, God, let me live."
00:59:00.680,00:59:02.320,Use your imagination!
00:59:02.360,00:59:03.560,I don't have to.
00:59:04.960,00:59:06.720,"Yeah, but if you were clever, really clever."
00:59:06.760,00:59:09.040,"Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers, she was clever."
00:59:09.080,00:59:10.800,She's trying to tell us something.
00:59:10.840,00:59:13.280,Isn't the doorbell working?
00:59:13.320,00:59:15.080,I didn't order a taxi.
00:59:15.120,00:59:17.760,"Oh, dear."
00:59:17.800,00:59:19.760,"It's a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson."
00:59:19.800,00:59:22.840,But they're just for my hip.
00:59:22.880,00:59:24.400,"Shut up, everybody! Shut up!"
00:59:24.440,00:59:26.400,"Don't move, don't speak, don't breathe."
00:59:26.440,00:59:28.320,"Anderson, face the other way."
00:59:28.360,00:59:29.840,What? My face is?
00:59:29.880,00:59:32.080,Everybody quiet and still.
00:59:32.120,00:59:33.320,"Oh, for God's sake!"
00:59:33.360,00:59:34.880,"Your back, now, please!"
00:59:34.920,00:59:36.960,"-Come on, think. Quick!"
00:59:37.000,00:59:38.080,Mrs Hudson!
00:59:40.840,00:59:42.040,Oh.
00:59:42.400,00:59:43.760,Ah!
00:59:44.880,00:59:48.280,"She was clever. Clever, yes!"
00:59:48.320,00:59:52.840,She's cleverer than you lot and she's dead.
00:59:52.880,00:59:56.440,"She didn't lose her phone, she never lost it."
00:59:56.480,00:59:59.240,"When she got out of the car, she knew that she was going to her death."
00:59:59.280,01:00:02.440,She left the phone in order to lead us to her killer.
01:00:02.480,01:00:03.720,But how?
01:00:03.760,01:00:05.200,"What do you mean, how?"
01:00:06.800,01:00:07.920,Rachel!
01:00:09.400,01:00:10.840,Don't you see? Rachel!
01:00:13.640,01:00:14.880,Oh...
01:00:14.920,01:00:16.760,Look at you lot.
01:00:16.800,01:00:19.120,Is it nice not being me?
01:00:19.160,01:00:20.560,Rachel is not a name.
01:00:20.600,01:00:21.960,Then what is it?
01:00:22.000,01:00:23.760,"John, on the luggage, there's a label."
01:00:27.920,01:00:30.480,"Er, jennie.pink@mephone.org.uk."
01:00:30.520,01:00:32.280,"Oh, I've been too slow."
01:00:30.520,01:00:33.920,"She didn't have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone."
01:00:33.960,01:00:35.880,"So it's a Smartphone, it's e-mail enabled."
01:00:35.920,01:00:37.400,So those are website for her account.
01:00:37.440,01:00:40.840,"The username is her e-mail address, and all together now, the password is?"
01:00:40.880,01:00:41.960,ANDERSON: Rachel.
01:00:42.000,01:00:43.720,So we can read her e-mails. So what?
01:00:43.760,01:00:46.720,"Anderson, don't talk out loud."
01:00:46.760,01:00:48.560,We can do much more than just read her e-mails.
01:00:48.600,01:00:50.440,"SHERLOCK: It's a Smartphone, it's got GPS."
01:00:50.480,01:00:52.720,Which means if you lose it you can locate it online.
01:00:52.760,01:00:55.000,She's leading us directly to the man who killed her.
01:00:55.040,01:00:57.360,-Unless he got rid of it.
01:00:57.400,01:00:59.640,"-Come on, come on. Quickly!"
01:00:59.680,01:01:01.160,This taxi driver...
01:01:01.200,01:01:04.760,"Mrs Hudson, isn't it time for your evening soother?"
01:01:04.800,01:01:06.520,"SHERLOCK: Get vehicles, get a helicopter."
01:01:06.560,01:01:08.520,We're gonna have to move fast.
01:01:08.560,01:01:09.960,"We'll just have a map reference, not a name."
01:01:10.000,01:01:11.360,SHERLOCK: It's a start!
01:01:11.400,01:01:13.480,-Sherlock?
01:01:13.520,01:01:15.920,-It's the first proper lead that we've had.
01:01:15.960,01:01:18.520,"Where is it? Quickly, where?"
01:01:18.560,01:01:21.360,JOHN: Here.
01:01:23.240,01:01:24.960,How can it be here?
01:01:25.400,01:01:27.360,How?
01:01:27.400,01:01:31.080,"Well, maybe it was in the case when you brought it back and it fell out somewhere."
01:01:31.120,01:01:33.680,"What, and I didn't notice it?"
01:01:33.720,01:01:35.880,"JOHN: Anyway, we texted him and he called back."
01:01:35.920,01:01:39.400,"Guys, we're also looking for a mobile somewhere here, belonged to the victim..."
01:01:39.440,01:01:41.720,"SHERLOCK: Who do we trust, even if we don't know them?"
01:01:51.800,01:01:54.520,Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?
01:01:59.000,01:02:01.600,Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?
01:02:39.320,01:02:40.720,"JOHN: Sherlock, you okay?"
01:02:40.760,01:02:41.960,What?
01:02:42.680,01:02:44.880,"Yeah, yeah. I'm fine."
01:02:44.920,01:02:46.840,"JOHN: So, how can the phone be here?"
01:02:46.880,01:02:48.080,Don't know.
01:02:48.120,01:02:50.200,-JOHN: I'll try it again.
01:02:50.240,01:02:51.720,"Hey, where are you going?"
01:02:51.760,01:02:54.160,"Fresh air, just popping outside for a moment."
01:02:55.000,01:02:56.320,You sure you're all right?
01:02:56.360,01:02:57.480,I'm fine.
01:03:07.880,01:03:09.160,Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.
01:03:13.040,01:03:15.040,I didn't order a taxi.
01:03:15.080,01:03:16.640,Doesn't mean you don't need one.
01:03:17.960,01:03:19.680,You're the cabbie.
01:03:21.080,01:03:24.000,The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street.
01:03:27.320,01:03:28.440,It was you.
01:03:29.640,01:03:31.160,Not your passenger.
01:03:31.200,01:03:34.240,See? No-one ever thinks about the cabbie.
01:03:34.280,01:03:36.160,It's like you're invisible.
01:03:36.200,01:03:39.000,Just the back of an 'ead.
01:03:39.040,01:03:41.360,Proper advantage for a serial killer.
01:03:44.040,01:03:46.440,-Is this a confession?
01:03:47.320,01:03:49.200,I'll tell you what else...
01:03:49.240,01:03:52.280,"If you call the coppers now, I won't run."
01:03:52.320,01:03:55.960,"I'll sit quiet and they can take me down, I promise."
01:03:56.000,01:03:57.360,Why?
01:03:57.400,01:03:59.040,'Cause you're not gonna do that.
01:03:59.080,01:04:00.160,Am I not?
01:04:02.000,01:04:05.160,"I didn't kill those four people, Mr Holmes."
01:04:05.200,01:04:10.960,I spoke to 'em and they killed themselves.
01:04:11.000,01:04:14.520,"If you get the coppers now, I'll promise you one thing."
01:04:15.560,01:04:17.600,I will never tell you what I said.
01:04:23.440,01:04:27.200,"No-one else will die, though, and I believe they call that a result."
01:04:27.240,01:04:30.560,And you won't ever understand how those people died.
01:04:31.720,01:04:34.240,What kind of result do you care about?
01:04:49.760,01:04:54.840,If I wanted to understand what would I do?
01:04:54.880,01:04:57.120,-Let me take you for a ride.
01:04:57.160,01:04:59.680,"I don't want to kill you, Mr Holmes."
01:05:01.000,01:05:06.920,I'm going to talk to ya and then you're gonna kill yourself.
01:05:24.320,01:05:25.600,He just got in a cab.
01:05:25.640,01:05:28.200,It's Sherlock.
01:05:28.240,01:05:29.720,"I told you, he does that."
01:05:29.760,01:05:31.440,He bloody left again.
01:05:31.480,01:05:33.400,We're wasting our time!
01:05:33.440,01:05:35.960,"I'm calling the phone, it's ringing out."
01:05:47.440,01:05:49.360,"And if it's ringing, it's not here."
01:05:49.400,01:05:50.600,I'll try the search again.
01:05:50.640,01:05:52.880,Does it matter?
01:05:52.920,01:05:55.400,"He's just a lunatic, and he'll always let you down."
01:05:55.440,01:05:58.360,And you're wasting your time.
01:06:05.320,01:06:08.800,"Okay, everybody, done here."
01:06:11.440,01:06:13.200,How did you find me?
01:06:13.240,01:06:15.040,"Oh, I recognised ya."
01:06:16.680,01:06:18.440,Soon as I saw you chasing my cab.
01:06:19.480,01:06:21.120,Sherlock Holmes!
01:06:22.400,01:06:23.760,I was warned about you.
01:06:25.040,01:06:27.000,"I've been on your website, too."
01:06:27.040,01:06:28.480,Brilliant stuff! Loved it.
01:06:29.640,01:06:31.080,Who warned you about me?
01:06:31.120,01:06:32.440,Just someone out there who's noticed.
01:06:34.760,01:06:35.960,Who?
01:06:43.040,01:06:44.760,Who would notice me?
01:06:44.800,01:06:46.320,"You're too modest, Mr Holmes."
01:06:46.360,01:06:48.040,I'm really not.
01:06:48.080,01:06:49.840,Got yourself a fan.
01:06:51.120,01:06:52.800,Tell me more.
01:06:52.840,01:06:54.320,That's all you're gonna know.
01:06:56.000,01:06:58.920,In this lifetime.
01:06:58.960,01:07:00.840,Why did he do that?
01:07:01.760,01:07:03.760,You know him better than I do.
01:07:03.800,01:07:06.440,"I've known him for five years, and no, I don't."
01:07:08.240,01:07:10.600,So why do you put up with him?
01:07:10.640,01:07:12.440,"Because I'm desperate, that's why."
01:07:14.920,01:07:23.120,"And because Sherlock Holmes is a great man, and I think one day, if we're very, very lucky, he might even be a good one."
01:07:44.280,01:07:46.640,Where are we?
01:07:46.680,01:07:48.480,You know every street in London.
01:07:48.520,01:07:50.280,You know exactly where we are.
01:07:50.320,01:07:52.800,Roland-Kerr Further Education College.
01:07:52.840,01:07:53.880,Why here?
01:07:54.400,01:07:55.920,It's open.
01:07:55.960,01:07:57.760,Cleaners are in.
01:07:57.800,01:08:02.200,"One thing about being a cabbie, you always know a nice quiet spot for a murder."
01:08:02.240,01:08:05.840,I'm surprised more of us don't branch out.
01:08:05.880,01:08:08.000,And you just walk your victims in? How?
01:08:09.760,01:08:11.840,Oh. Dull.
01:08:11.880,01:08:14.440,Don't worry. It gets better.
01:08:14.480,01:08:17.280,You can't make people take their own lives at gunpoint.
01:08:17.320,01:08:18.880,I don't.
01:08:18.920,01:08:21.400,It's much better than that.
01:08:21.440,01:08:24.680,Don't need this with you.
01:09:17.000,01:09:18.480,"Well, what do you think?"
01:09:20.040,01:09:21.760,It's up to you.
01:09:21.800,01:09:23.360,You're the one who's gonna die here.
01:09:25.840,01:09:27.320,"No, I'm not."
01:09:27.360,01:09:28.520,That's what they all say.
01:09:30.960,01:09:32.520,Shall we talk?
01:09:47.120,01:09:49.680,"Bit risky, wasn't it?"
01:09:49.720,01:09:52.680,Took me away under the eye of about half a dozen policemen.
01:09:52.720,01:09:55.080,They're not that stupid.
01:09:55.120,01:09:57.080,And Mrs Hudson will remember you.
01:09:57.120,01:09:59.280,You call that a risk? Nah...
01:10:00.120,01:10:01.760,This is a risk.
01:10:10.000,01:10:12.480,"Oh, I like this bit."
01:10:12.520,01:10:14.200,"'Cause you don't get it yet, do ya?"
01:10:16.360,01:10:18.160,But you're about to.
01:10:19.080,01:10:21.160,I just have to do this.
01:10:27.160,01:10:29.840,"Weren't expecting that, were ya?"
01:10:29.880,01:10:31.440,"Oh, you're going to love this."
01:10:31.480,01:10:32.680,Love what?
01:10:32.720,01:10:34.960,Sherlock Holmes! Look at you!
01:10:36.680,01:10:37.840,Here in the flesh.
01:10:39.320,01:10:41.680,"That website of yours, your fan told me about it."
01:10:42.200,01:10:43.880,My fan?
01:10:43.920,01:10:46.120,You are brilliant.
01:10:46.160,01:10:49.200,You are a proper genius.
01:10:49.240,01:10:52.440,The Science of Deduction.
01:10:49.240,01:10:54.240,"Now, that is proper thinking."
01:10:56.040,01:10:58.560,"Between you and me sitting here, why can't people think?"
01:11:00.560,01:11:02.440,Don't it make you mad?
01:11:03.520,01:11:05.760,Why can't people just think?
01:11:10.400,01:11:13.600,"Oh, I see. So you're a proper genius, too."
01:11:14.400,01:11:16.200,"Don't look it, do I?"
01:11:17.160,01:11:19.360,Funny little man driving a cab.
01:11:19.400,01:11:21.120,But you'll know better in a minute.
01:11:22.480,01:11:25.760,Chances are it'll be the last thing you ever know.
01:11:27.360,01:11:28.800,"Okay, two bottles. Explain."
01:11:30.800,01:11:33.320,There's a good bottle and a bad bottle.
01:11:33.360,01:11:36.280,"You take the pill from the good bottle, you live."
01:11:36.320,01:11:39.760,"You take the pill from the bad bottle, you die."
01:11:39.800,01:11:41.400,"Both bottles are, of course identical."
01:11:41.440,01:11:42.760,In every way.
01:11:42.800,01:11:44.240,-And you know which is which.
01:11:44.280,01:11:45.920,But I don't.
01:11:45.960,01:11:48.480,Wouldn't be a game if you knew.
01:11:48.520,01:11:51.000,Why should I?
01:11:51.040,01:11:53.040,What's in it for me?
01:11:53.080,01:11:55.280,I haven't told you the best bit yet.
01:11:56.160,01:11:59.960,"Whatever bottle you choose, I take the pill from the other one."
01:12:00.760,01:12:04.640,And then together we take our medicine.
01:12:07.080,01:12:09.400,I won't cheat.
01:12:10.920,01:12:12.960,I'll take whatever pill you don't.
01:12:16.240,01:12:18.960,"Didn't expect that, did you, Mr Holmes?"
01:12:19.000,01:12:22.120,"This is what you did to the rest of them, you gave them a choice?"
01:12:22.160,01:12:23.400,And now I'm giving you one.
01:12:25.440,01:12:27.200,You take your time.
01:12:27.240,01:12:28.960,Get yourself together.
01:12:29.920,01:12:31.320,I want your best game.
01:12:31.360,01:12:32.840,"It's not a game, it's chance."
01:12:32.880,01:12:35.360,I've played four times.
01:12:36.880,01:12:39.520,"It's not chance, Mr Holmes, it's chess."
01:12:40.720,01:12:46.600,"It's a game of chess, with one move and one survivor."
01:12:48.120,01:12:52.320,And this... This is the move.
01:13:00.920,01:13:04.240,Did I just give you the good bottle or the bad bottle?
01:13:04.280,01:13:06.240,You can choose either one.
01:13:09.600,01:13:12.480,"JOHN: No, Detective Inspector Lestrade, I need to speak to him."
01:13:12.520,01:13:15.040,It's important.
01:13:15.080,01:13:16.800,"Er, left here, please."
01:13:28.920,01:13:30.800,"You ready yet, Mr Holmes?"
01:13:30.840,01:13:32.120,Ready to play?
01:13:32.160,01:13:34.800,Play what?
01:13:34.840,01:13:37.280,"You're not playing the numbers, you're playing me."
01:13:40.160,01:13:42.400,Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill?
01:13:43.040,01:13:46.560,"Is it a bluff, or a double bluff?"
01:13:46.600,01:13:47.720,Or a triple bluff?
01:13:47.760,01:13:48.960,It's still just chance.
01:13:49.000,01:13:50.720,"Four people, in a row?"
01:13:50.760,01:13:52.360,-Luck.
01:13:54.160,01:13:55.640,I know how people think.
01:13:56.680,01:13:59.720,I know how people think I think.
01:13:59.760,01:14:02.080,I can see it all like a map inside my head.
01:14:03.240,01:14:05.520,"Everyone's so stupid, even you."
01:14:06.480,01:14:08.000,Or maybe God just loves me.
01:14:11.680,01:14:14.360,"Either way, you're wasted as a cabbie."
01:14:22.960,01:14:25.600,So...
01:14:25.640,01:14:29.920,You risked your life four times just to kill strangers? Why?
01:14:29.960,01:14:31.520,Time to play.
01:14:31.560,01:14:32.920,"Oh, I am playing."
01:14:33.680,01:14:34.760,This is my turn.
01:14:36.040,01:14:38.320,There's shaving foam behind your left ear.
01:14:38.360,01:14:40.440,Nobody's pointed it out to you.
01:14:40.480,01:14:44.560,"Traces of where it's happened before, so obviously you live on your own there's no-one to tell you."
01:14:44.600,01:14:46.200,But there's a photograph of children.
01:14:46.240,01:14:48.120,The children's mother's been cut out of the picture.
01:14:48.160,01:14:49.560,"If she'd died, she'd still be there."
01:14:49.600,01:14:51.800,"The photograph's old, but the frame's new."
01:14:51.840,01:14:54.360,"You think of your children, but you don't get to see them."
01:14:54.400,01:14:56.600,Estranged father.
01:14:56.640,01:15:01.120,"She took the kids, but you still love them and it still hurts."
01:15:02.840,01:15:04.080,"Ah, but there's more."
01:15:06.080,01:15:08.200,Your clothes.
01:15:06.080,01:15:11.600,"Recently laundered, but everything you're wearing is at least three years old?"
01:15:11.640,01:15:15.800,"Keeping up appearances, but not planning ahead."
01:15:15.840,01:15:19.800,And here you are on a kamikaze murder spree.
01:15:24.160,01:15:26.040,Ah...
01:15:26.080,01:15:28.360,Three years ago.
01:15:28.400,01:15:30.600,Told me what?
01:15:30.640,01:15:32.000,That you're a dead man walking.
01:15:32.040,01:15:33.120,So are you.
01:15:33.160,01:15:34.360,"You don't have long, though."
01:15:34.400,01:15:35.440,Am I right?
01:15:37.640,01:15:39.800,Aneurism. Right in 'ere.
01:15:43.040,01:15:46.120,Any breath could be my last.
01:15:46.160,01:15:49.200,"And because you're dying, you've just murdered four people."
01:15:49.240,01:15:51.400,I've outlived four people.
01:15:53.120,01:15:55.520,That's the most fun you can have with an aneurism.
01:15:56.400,01:15:57.920,No...
01:15:57.960,01:16:00.280,"No, there's something else."
01:16:00.320,01:16:02.320,You didn't just kill four people because you're bitter.
01:16:02.360,01:16:04.640,Bitterness is a paralytic.
01:16:04.680,01:16:07.960,Love is a much more vicious motivator.
01:16:09.640,01:16:11.840,"Somehow, this is about your children."
01:16:12.800,01:16:14.160,Oh.
01:16:16.080,01:16:17.520,"You are good, in't ya?"
01:16:17.560,01:16:18.680,But how?
01:16:20.320,01:16:23.080,"When I die they won't get much, my kids."
01:16:25.440,01:16:27.240,Not a lot of money in driving cabs.
01:16:27.280,01:16:28.480,Or serial killing.
01:16:28.520,01:16:30.080,You'd be surprised.
01:16:30.120,01:16:31.320,Surprise me.
01:16:33.960,01:16:35.880,I have a sponsor.
01:16:35.920,01:16:37.360,You have a what?
01:16:37.400,01:16:40.680,"For every life I take, money goes to my kids."
01:16:40.720,01:16:43.200,"The more I kill, the better off they'll be."
01:16:45.600,01:16:48.120,You see?
01:16:48.160,01:16:50.000,Who'd sponsor a serial killer?
01:16:50.040,01:16:52.560,Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes?
01:16:56.560,01:16:59.560,You're not the only one to enjoy a good murder.
01:16:59.600,01:17:04.480,"There's others out there just like you, except you're just a man."
01:17:04.520,01:17:06.960,And they're so much more than that.
01:17:08.760,01:17:11.840,"What do you mean, more than a man?"
01:17:13.760,01:17:15.800,An organisation? What?
01:17:15.840,01:17:18.280,"There's a name, that no-one says."
01:17:19.640,01:17:21.360,And I'm not gonna say it either.
01:17:22.920,01:17:24.880,"Now, enough chatter."
01:17:27.360,01:17:28.840,Time to choose.
01:17:33.800,01:17:35.360,JOHN: Sherlock?
01:17:39.840,01:17:41.520,Sherlock!
01:17:41.560,01:17:44.640,What if I don't choose either?
01:17:48.560,01:17:53.880,"You can take a 50-50 chance, or I can shoot you in the head."
01:17:55.320,01:17:59.360,"Funnily enough, no-one's ever gone for that option."
01:17:59.400,01:18:00.880,"I'll have the gun, please."
01:18:02.040,01:18:03.560,Are you sure?
01:18:04.720,01:18:07.560,Definitely. The gun.
01:18:07.600,01:18:09.240,You don't want to phone a friend?
01:18:10.520,01:18:11.840,The gun.
01:18:17.760,01:18:19.360,I know a real gun when I see one.
01:18:20.880,01:18:22.560,None of the others did.
01:18:22.600,01:18:24.640,Clearly.
01:18:24.680,01:18:28.520,"Well, this has been very interesting."
01:18:28.560,01:18:30.880,I look forward to the court case.
01:18:34.200,01:18:36.280,"Just before you go, did you figure it out?"
01:18:38.400,01:18:40.160,Which one's the good bottle?
01:18:40.200,01:18:42.040,Course. Child's play.
01:18:43.080,01:18:44.360,"Well, which one, then?"
01:18:46.000,01:18:47.440,Which one would you have picked?
01:18:47.480,01:18:50.080,Just so I know whether I could have beaten you.
01:18:51.800,01:18:53.400,Come on!
01:18:53.440,01:18:55.040,Play the game.
01:19:09.040,01:19:10.280,Oh!
01:19:11.360,01:19:12.920,Interesting.
01:19:21.720,01:19:23.560,So what do you think?
01:19:24.440,01:19:25.840,Shall we?
01:19:28.680,01:19:30.680,Really. What do you think?
01:19:32.880,01:19:34.160,Can you beat me?
01:19:36.880,01:19:41.160,"Are you clever enough, to bet your life?"
01:19:57.200,01:19:58.800,"I bet you get bored, don't you?"
01:20:00.160,01:20:01.440,I know you do.
01:20:02.400,01:20:03.480,A man like you.
01:20:04.760,01:20:07.080,So clever.
01:20:07.120,01:20:10.600,But what's the point of being clever if you can't prove it?
01:20:12.160,01:20:13.680,Still the addict.
01:20:15.440,01:20:18.880,"But this, this is what you're really addicted to."
01:20:21.360,01:20:22.560,You'll do anything...
01:20:24.120,01:20:27.280,"Anything at all, to stop being bored."
01:20:30.000,01:20:31.600,"You're not bored now, are ya?"
01:20:32.440,01:20:33.840,Isn't it good?
01:20:49.400,01:20:50.760,Was I right?
01:20:50.800,01:20:52.640,"I was, wasn't I?"
01:20:52.680,01:20:53.840,Did I get it right?
01:20:58.040,01:21:00.240,Okay. Tell me this.
01:21:01.960,01:21:04.640,Your sponsor. Who was it?
01:21:04.680,01:21:06.520,"The one who told you about me, my fan."
01:21:07.040,01:21:08.240,I want a name.
01:21:08.600,01:21:10.280,No.
01:21:10.320,01:21:13.080,"You're dying, but there's still time to hurt you."
01:21:13.120,01:21:14.200,Give me a name.
01:21:18.760,01:21:21.080,A name! Now.
01:21:23.200,01:21:24.440,The name!
01:21:50.000,01:21:52.680,Why have I got this blanket?
01:21:52.720,01:21:54.920,"-Yeah, it's for shock."
01:21:54.960,01:21:57.120,"Yeah, but some of the guys want to take photographs."
01:21:59.080,01:22:00.840,"So, the shooter. No sign?"
01:22:00.880,01:22:02.600,Cleared off before we got here.
01:22:02.640,01:22:04.800,"But a guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose."
01:22:04.840,01:22:06.440,"One of them could have been following him, but..."
01:22:07.800,01:22:09.000,We've got nothing to go on.
01:22:09.800,01:22:11.480,"Oh, I wouldn't say that."
01:22:13.400,01:22:15.200,Okay. Give me.
01:22:15.240,01:22:17.840,The bullet they just dug out of the wall's from a handgun.
01:22:17.880,01:22:19.720,"A kill shot over that distance, that kind of a weapon."
01:22:19.760,01:22:20.960,That's a crack shot we're looking for.
01:22:21.000,01:22:22.960,"But not just a marksman, a fighter."
01:22:23.000,01:22:26.000,"His hands couldn't have shaken at all, so clearly he's acclimatised to violence."
01:22:26.040,01:22:29.880,"He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principle."
01:22:29.920,01:22:35.160,"You're looking for a man probably with a history of military service, and nerves of steel..."
01:22:41.800,01:22:43.560,"Actually, do you know what?"
01:22:43.600,01:22:45.080,-Sorry?
01:22:45.120,01:22:47.520,"It's just the, er, the shock talking."
01:22:47.560,01:22:48.720,Where are you going?
01:22:48.760,01:22:50.680,I just need to talk about the rent.
01:22:50.720,01:22:52.320,-I've still got questions.
01:22:52.360,01:22:54.160,"I'm in shock, look, I've got a blanket."
01:22:54.200,01:22:55.400,Sherlock!
01:22:55.440,01:22:58.240,"And, I just caught you a serial killer."
01:22:58.280,01:22:59.360,More or less.
01:23:02.160,01:23:03.400,Okay.
01:23:03.440,01:23:06.160,"We'll pull you in tomorrow, off you go."
01:23:12.920,01:23:16.600,"Erm, Sergeant Donovan has just been explaining everything."
01:23:16.640,01:23:17.680,The two pills.
01:23:19.600,01:23:21.560,"Dreadful business, isn't it?"
01:23:22.800,01:23:24.960,Good shot.
01:23:25.000,01:23:27.200,"Yes. Yes, must have been."
01:23:27.240,01:23:28.280,"Well, you'd know."
01:23:30.640,01:23:32.600,Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers.
01:23:32.640,01:23:35.720,"I don't suppose you'd serve time for this, but let's avoid the court case."
01:23:37.200,01:23:38.440,Are you all right?
01:23:38.480,01:23:39.880,"Yes, of course I'm all right."
01:23:39.920,01:23:41.280,"-Well, you have just killed a man."
01:23:45.000,01:23:46.360,"That's true, isn't it?"
01:23:47.960,01:23:49.600,But he wasn't a very nice man.
01:23:51.320,01:23:52.800,"No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?"
01:23:52.840,01:23:54.480,Frankly a bloody awful cabbie.
01:23:56.320,01:23:58.440,"That's true, he was a bad cabbie."
01:23:58.480,01:24:00.840,You should have seen the route he took us to get here.
01:24:00.880,01:24:03.520,"Stop it! We can't giggle, it's a crime scene. Stop it."
01:24:03.560,01:24:06.080,"-Well, you're the one who shot him."
01:24:06.120,01:24:07.720,"Sorry, it's just, erm, nerves, I think."
01:24:07.760,01:24:10.080,Sorry.
01:24:10.120,01:24:12.320,"You were gonna take that damn pill, weren't you?"
01:24:12.360,01:24:14.480,Course I wasn't.
01:24:14.520,01:24:16.640,Biding my time.
01:24:17.440,01:24:19.080,"No, you didn't."
01:24:19.120,01:24:20.600,"That's how you get your kicks, isn't it?"
01:24:20.640,01:24:22.080,You risk your life to prove you're clever.
01:24:22.120,01:24:24.080,-Why would I do that?
01:24:26.400,01:24:27.520,Dinner?
01:24:28.040,01:24:29.720,Starving.
01:24:29.760,01:24:32.040,End of Baker Street there's a good Chinese.
01:24:32.080,01:24:34.960,SHERLOCK: You can tell a good Chinese by the bottom third of the door handle.
01:24:35.000,01:24:38.560,"Sherlock. That's him, that's the man I was talking to you about."
01:24:38.600,01:24:41.360,I know exactly who that is.
01:24:41.400,01:24:44.080,So... Another case cracked.
01:24:44.120,01:24:46.360,How very public-spirited.
01:24:46.400,01:24:48.560,"Though that's never really your motivation, is it?"
01:24:49.480,01:24:51.240,What are you doing here?
01:24:51.280,01:24:52.920,"As ever, I'm concerned about you."
01:24:52.960,01:24:55.320,"Yes, I've been hearing about your concern."
01:24:55.360,01:24:57.160,Always so aggressive.
01:24:57.200,01:24:59.960,Did it never occur to you that you and I belong on the same side?
01:25:00.000,01:25:02.320,"Oddly enough, no."
01:25:02.360,01:25:05.280,We have more in common than you'd like to believe.
01:25:05.320,01:25:08.080,This petty feud between us is simply childish.
01:25:08.120,01:25:09.840,People will suffer.
01:25:09.880,01:25:11.800,And you know how it always upset Mummy.
01:25:13.320,01:25:14.800,I upset her?
01:25:14.840,01:25:15.920,Me?
01:25:17.200,01:25:19.400,"It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft."
01:25:19.440,01:25:20.960,"No. No, wait..."
01:25:21.000,01:25:22.280,Mummy? Who's Mummy?
01:25:22.320,01:25:24.480,Mother. Our mother.
01:25:24.520,01:25:26.760,"This is my brother, Mycroft."
01:25:26.800,01:25:28.240,SHERLOCK: Putting on weight again?
01:25:29.240,01:25:30.680,"Losing it, in fact."
01:25:30.720,01:25:31.800,He's your brother?
01:25:31.840,01:25:33.600,Of course he's my brother.
01:25:34.720,01:25:36.200,-So he's not...
01:25:37.920,01:25:40.800,I don't know.
01:25:40.840,01:25:42.200,Close enough.
01:25:42.240,01:25:43.680,For goodness' sake.
01:25:43.720,01:25:45.960,I occupy a minor position in the British government.
01:25:46.000,01:25:52.320,"SHERLOCK: He is the British government, when he's not too busy being the British secret service or the CIA on a freelance basis."
01:25:52.360,01:25:54.040,"Good evening, Mycroft."
01:25:54.080,01:25:57.320,"Try not to start a war before I get home, you know what it does for the traffic."
01:26:00.440,01:26:04.240,"So, when you say you're concerned about him, you actually are concerned?"
01:26:04.280,01:26:06.440,"Yes, of course."
01:26:06.480,01:26:09.080,"I mean, it actually is a childish feud?"
01:26:09.120,01:26:11.480,He's always been so resentful.
01:26:11.520,01:26:13.320,You can imagine the Christmas dinners.
01:26:13.800,01:26:14.920,Yeah.
01:26:14.960,01:26:16.560,"No... God, no."
01:26:18.040,01:26:19.680,"I'd better, erm..."
01:26:19.720,01:26:20.760,"Hello, again."
01:26:21.960,01:26:23.240,Hello.
01:26:23.280,01:26:25.240,We met earlier on this evening.
01:26:26.160,01:26:27.320,Oh!
01:26:27.360,01:26:28.640,Okay. Goodnight.
01:26:28.680,01:26:30.120,"Goodnight, Dr Watson."
01:26:32.160,01:26:33.880,"-So, dim sum."
01:26:33.920,01:26:35.600,I can always predict the fortune cookies.
01:26:35.640,01:26:36.760,"-No, you can't."
01:26:36.800,01:26:38.640,"-You did get shot, though."
01:26:38.680,01:26:40.360,In Afghanistan.
01:26:40.400,01:26:43.040,"-Oh. Yeah, shoulder."
01:26:43.080,01:26:44.360,"-No, you didn't."
01:26:44.400,01:26:46.360,-Lucky guess.
01:26:46.400,01:26:47.920,"Yes, you do."
01:26:47.960,01:26:50.480,-What are you so happy about?
01:26:50.520,01:26:53.320,-What's Moriarty?
01:26:55.520,01:26:58.000,"Sir, shall we go?"
01:26:58.040,01:27:00.560,"Interesting, that soldier fellow."
01:27:00.600,01:27:06.240,"He could be the making of my brother, or make him worse than ever."
01:27:06.280,01:27:09.080,"Either way, we'd better upgrade their surveillance status."
01:27:09.880,01:27:11.800,Grade three active.
01:27:11.840,01:27:13.440,"Sorry, sir, whose status?"
01:27:15.680,01:27:18.440,"Sherlock Holmes, and Dr Watson."
00:00:16.200,00:00:23.840,WOMAN: The great artisans say the more the teapot is used the more beautiful it becomes.
00:00:26.000,00:00:30.440,The pot is seasoned by repeatedly pouring tea over the surface.
00:00:32.520,00:00:39.080,The deposit left on the clay creates this beautiful patina over time.
00:00:39.120,00:00:44.280,"Some pots, the clay has been burnished by tea made over 400 years ago."
00:00:55.400,00:00:58.640,WOMAN ANNOUNCING: This museum will be closing in 10 minutes.
00:00:58.680,00:01:02.920,"Four hundred years old, they're letting you use it to make yourself a brew."
00:01:02.960,00:01:09.200,"Some things aren't supposed to sit behind glass, they're made to be touched, to be handled."
00:01:12.400,00:01:17.000,These pots need attention.
00:01:17.040,00:01:20.480,"Well, I can't see how a tiny splash of tea is going to help."
00:01:20.520,00:01:24.920,Sometimes you have to look hard at something to see its value.
00:01:27.360,00:01:29.080,See?
00:01:29.120,00:01:31.560,This one shines a little brighter.
00:01:32.840,00:01:35.320,I don't suppose...
00:01:35.360,00:01:38.320,I don't suppose that you want to have a drink?
00:01:38.360,00:01:42.840,"Not tea, obviously."
00:01:43.320,00:01:44.480,Um...
00:01:45.600,00:01:47.720,You wouldn't like me all that much.
00:01:48.960,00:01:51.440,Can I maybe decide that for myself?
00:01:55.040,00:01:56.280,I can't.
00:01:57.240,00:01:58.560,I'm sorry.
00:02:00.120,00:02:01.360,Please stop asking.
00:02:27.360,00:02:29.000,Is that security?
00:02:46.800,00:02:47.960,Hello?
00:03:56.480,00:03:59.240,WOMAN ANNOUNCING OVER P.A: Can the till supervisor please go to...
00:03:59.280,00:04:02.840,"AUTOMATED VOICE: Unexpected item in bagging area, please try again."
00:04:10.920,00:04:13.360,Item not scanned.
00:04:13.400,00:04:14.920,Can you maybe keep your voice down?
00:04:26.000,00:04:28.800,-Card not authorised.
00:04:28.840,00:04:30.640,Please use an alternative method of payment.
00:04:30.680,00:04:33.560,Card not authorised.
00:04:33.600,00:04:35.320,Keep it. Keep that.
00:04:58.280,00:05:00.160,-You took your time.
00:05:00.200,00:05:01.680,What? Why not?
00:05:01.720,00:05:04.960,Because I had a row in the shop with a chip and PIN machine.
00:05:05.000,00:05:07.480,You...
00:05:07.520,00:05:10.640,Sort of. It sat there and I shouted abuse.
00:05:10.680,00:05:12.120,Take my card.
00:05:15.200,00:05:19.840,"You could always go yourself, you know, you've been sitting there all morning and not even moved since I left."
00:05:22.280,00:05:25.560,"And what happened about that case you were offered, the Jaria diamond?"
00:05:25.600,00:05:26.800,Not interested.
00:05:29.360,00:05:30.440,I sent them a message.
00:05:44.480,00:05:46.920,"Don't worry about me, I can manage."
00:05:55.840,00:05:58.280,-Is that my computer?
00:05:58.320,00:06:00.280,-What?
00:06:00.320,00:06:02.160,What? And you couldn't be bothered to get up?
00:06:03.200,00:06:04.880,It's password protected.
00:06:04.920,00:06:06.720,In a manner of speaking.
00:06:04.920,00:06:10.240,"Took me less than a minute to guess yours, -not exactly Fort Knox."
00:06:17.720,00:06:18.840,Oh.
00:06:24.320,00:06:26.480,-Need to get a job.
00:06:30.320,00:06:31.760,"Listen, um..."
00:06:35.000,00:06:37.600,If you'd be able to lend me some...
00:06:39.800,00:06:43.120,"-Sherlock, are you listening?"
00:07:07.760,00:07:09.720,"Yes, when you said we were going to the bank..."
00:07:29.680,00:07:30.960,Sherlock Holmes.
00:07:34.120,00:07:36.200,-Sherlock Holmes.
00:07:36.240,00:07:39.040,"Hiya, buddy. How long has it been, eight years since I last clapped eyes on you?"
00:07:39.960,00:07:42.040,"This is my friend, John Watson."
00:07:42.080,00:07:43.440,-Friend?
00:07:45.280,00:07:46.400,Right.
00:07:47.600,00:07:49.320,Grab a pew.
00:07:49.360,00:07:51.280,"Do you need anything, coffee, water?"
00:07:51.320,00:07:53.760,"No? We're all sorted here, thanks."
00:07:56.280,00:07:58.200,So you're doing well.
00:07:58.840,00:08:00.480,"Well, so?"
00:08:00.520,00:08:03.120,Flying all the way around the world twice in a month.
00:08:03.160,00:08:06.760,You're doing that thing.
00:08:06.800,00:08:10.720,"We were at uny together, and this guy here had a trick he used to do."
00:08:10.760,00:08:12.120,It's not a trick.
00:08:12.160,00:08:14.560,He could look at you and tell you your whole life story.
00:08:14.600,00:08:17.960,"-Yes, I've seen him do it."
00:08:18.000,00:08:21.600,We'd come down to breakfast in the formal hall and this freak would know you'd been shagging the previous night.
00:08:21.640,00:08:23.120,I simply observed.
00:08:23.160,00:08:24.800,"Go on, enlighten me."
00:08:24.840,00:08:26.840,"Two trips a month, flying all the way around the world?"
00:08:26.880,00:08:28.560,You're quite right.
00:08:28.600,00:08:31.320,How could you tell?
00:08:28.600,00:08:34.320,Are you going to tell me there's a stain on my tie from some special kind of ketchup you can only buy in Manhattan?
00:08:34.360,00:08:36.360,"-No, I..."
00:08:37.880,00:08:40.360,I was just chatting with your secretary outside.
00:08:41.040,00:08:42.440,She told me.
00:08:48.280,00:08:51.360,"I'm glad you could make it over, we've had a break-in."
00:08:51.400,00:08:54.000,"Sir William's office, the bank's former chairman."
00:08:54.040,00:08:56.640,The room's been left here like a sort of memorial.
00:08:56.680,00:08:59.000,Someone broke in late last night.
00:08:59.040,00:09:00.960,-What did they steal?
00:09:01.840,00:09:04.320,Just left a little message.
00:09:20.800,00:09:22.440,Sixty seconds apart.
00:09:29.000,00:09:34.800,"So, someone came up here in the middle of the night, splashed paint around and left within a minute."
00:09:34.840,00:09:36.600,How many ways into that office?
00:09:36.640,00:09:39.680,"Well, that's where this gets really interesting."
00:09:39.720,00:09:42.640,"Every door that opens in this bank, it gets logged right here."
00:09:42.680,00:09:44.960,"Every walk-in cupboard, every toilet."
00:09:45.000,00:09:47.400,That door didn't open last night?
00:09:47.440,00:09:49.360,There's a hole in our security.
00:09:49.400,00:09:52.040,"Find it and we'll pay you, five figures."
00:09:52.720,00:09:54.480,This is an advance.
00:09:54.520,00:09:57.080,Tell me how he got in.
00:09:57.120,00:09:59.680,"I don't need an incentive, Sebastian."
00:10:03.400,00:10:06.040,"He's, uh..."
00:10:06.080,00:10:08.920,Shall I look after that for him? Thanks.
00:11:57.440,00:12:00.680,Two trips around the world this month.
00:12:00.720,00:12:04.880,"You didn't ask his secretary, you said that just to irritate him."
00:12:04.920,00:12:06.280,-How did you know?
00:12:06.320,00:12:07.640,WATSON: His watch?
00:12:07.680,00:12:09.600,"The time was right, but the date was wrong."
00:12:09.640,00:12:13.440,It was set two days ago.
00:12:13.480,00:12:15.520,-Within a month?
00:12:15.560,00:12:18.200,Only came out this February.
00:12:18.240,00:12:21.480,Okay. So do you think we should sniff around here for a bit longer?
00:12:21.520,00:12:23.680,"Got everything I need to know already, thanks."
00:12:23.720,00:12:26.120,That graffiti was a message.
00:12:26.160,00:12:28.640,"Someone at the bank, working on the trading floors."
00:12:28.680,00:12:31.000,We find the intended recipient and...
00:12:31.040,00:12:32.560,They'll lead us to the person who sent it?
00:12:32.600,00:12:34.080,Obvious.
00:12:34.120,00:12:35.960,"Well, there's 300 people up there, who was it meant for?"
00:12:36.000,00:12:37.720,-Pillars.
00:12:37.760,00:12:39.280,Pillars and the screens.
00:12:39.320,00:12:41.080,Very few places you could see that graffiti from.
00:12:41.120,00:12:43.160,That narrows the field considerably.
00:12:43.200,00:12:47.000,"And, of course, the message was left at 11.34 last night."
00:12:47.040,00:12:48.800,-Does it?
00:12:48.840,00:12:50.920,Some trade with Hong Kong in the middle of the night.
00:12:50.960,00:12:52.880,That message was intended for somebody who came in at midnight.
00:12:54.880,00:12:57.680,Not many Van Coons in the phone book.
00:12:57.720,00:12:59.000,Taxi!
00:13:19.200,00:13:22.080,So what do we do now?
00:13:23.360,00:13:24.800,-Just moved in.
00:13:24.840,00:13:27.960,"-Floor above, new label."
00:13:30.160,00:13:32.120,No one ever does that.
00:13:32.160,00:13:33.880,WOMAN: Hello?
00:13:33.920,00:13:38.000,"Hi, um, I live in the flat just below you."
00:13:38.040,00:13:41.600,No.
00:13:41.640,00:13:45.320,"Actually, I've just locked my keys in my flat."
00:13:45.360,00:13:46.800,Do you want me to buzz you in?
00:13:46.840,00:13:49.120,Yeah. And can we use your balcony?
00:13:49.160,00:13:50.320,What?
00:14:29.840,00:14:31.320,WATSON: Sherlock?
00:14:33.200,00:14:35.440,"WATSON: Sherlock, are you okay?"
00:14:39.960,00:14:42.360,"Yeah, any time you feel like letting me in."
00:14:57.920,00:14:59.480,Do you think he'd lost a lot of money?
00:14:59.520,00:15:01.600,"I mean, suicide is pretty common among city boys."
00:15:01.640,00:15:03.880,-We don't know that it was suicide.
00:15:03.920,00:15:07.320,"The door was locked from the inside, you had to climb down the balcony."
00:15:07.360,00:15:10.560,Been away three days judging by the laundry.
00:15:13.320,00:15:15.600,"Look at the case, there was something tightly packed inside it."
00:15:15.640,00:15:19.160,-Thanks.
00:15:19.200,00:15:22.600,"Yeah, I'm not desperate to root around some bloke's dirty underwear."
00:15:22.640,00:15:25.440,"Those symbols at the bank, the graffiti, why were they put there?"
00:15:25.480,00:15:27.400,-As some sort of code?
00:15:27.440,00:15:29.920,Why were they painted?
00:15:29.960,00:15:31.360,"Well, maybe he wasn't answering."
00:15:31.400,00:15:33.600,"-Oh, good, you follow."
00:15:34.960,00:15:37.040,What kind of a message would everyone try to avoid?
00:15:38.920,00:15:42.480,What about this morning?
00:15:42.520,00:15:43.560,Bills?
00:15:46.240,00:15:48.760,Yes. He was being threatened.
00:15:48.800,00:15:49.840,"MAN: Bag this up will you, and, uh..."
00:15:49.880,00:15:51.200,Not by the Gas Board.
00:15:51.240,00:15:52.960,MAN: ...and see if you can get prints off this glass.
00:15:54.480,00:15:56.240,"Sergeant, we haven't met."
00:15:56.280,00:16:00.120,"Yeah, I know who you are and I would prefer it if you didn't tamper with any of the evidence."
00:16:05.000,00:16:08.760,-I phoned Lestrade.
00:16:08.800,00:16:11.600,"And it's not Sergeant, it's Detective Inspector Dimmock."
00:16:16.280,00:16:18.480,We're obviously looking at a suicide.
00:16:18.520,00:16:20.960,It does seem the only explanation of all the facts.
00:16:21.000,00:16:23.800,"Wrong, it's one possible explanation of some of the facts."
00:16:23.840,00:16:27.800,"You've got a solution that you like, but you are choosing to ignore anything you see that doesn't comply with it."
00:16:27.840,00:16:29.480,-Like?
00:16:29.520,00:16:31.600,-And?
00:16:31.640,00:16:33.520,Requires quite a bit of contortion.
00:16:33.560,00:16:35.520,Left-handed?
00:16:35.560,00:16:37.360,"I'm amazed you didn't notice, all you have to do is look around this flat."
00:16:37.400,00:16:40.440,"Coffee table on the left-hand side, coffee mug handle pointing to the left."
00:16:40.480,00:16:42.320,"Power sockets, habitually used the ones on the left."
00:16:42.360,00:16:46.400,Pen and paper on the left hand side of the phone because he picked it up with his right and took down messages with his left.
00:16:46.440,00:16:48.040,-Do you want me to go on?
00:16:48.080,00:16:50.000,"I might as well, I'm almost at the bottom of the list."
00:16:50.040,00:16:53.320,There's a knife on the bread board with butter on the right side of the blade because he used it with his left.
00:16:53.360,00:16:57.040,It's highly unlikely that a left-handed man would shoot himself in the right side of his head.
00:16:57.080,00:17:00.560,"Conclusion, someone broke in here and murdered him, only explanation of all of the facts."
00:17:00.600,00:17:03.360,-But the gun?
00:17:03.400,00:17:06.080,-He'd been threatened.
00:17:06.120,00:17:08.840,"Today at the bank, sort of a warning."
00:17:08.880,00:17:11.000,He fired a shot when his attacker came in.
00:17:11.040,00:17:13.400,-And the bullet?
00:17:13.440,00:17:15.280,"Oh, come on."
00:17:15.320,00:17:17.040,What are the chances of that?
00:17:17.080,00:17:19.080,Wait until you get the ballistics report.
00:17:19.120,00:17:22.320,"The bullet in his brain wasn't fired from his gun, I guarantee it."
00:17:22.360,00:17:26.040,"If his door was locked from the inside, how did the killer get in?"
00:17:26.080,00:17:29.040,"Good, you're finally asking the right questions."
00:17:35.680,00:17:40.200,"So, he's left trying to sort of cut his hair with a fork, can never be done."
00:17:40.240,00:17:42.720,"It was a threat, that's what the graffiti meant."
00:17:43.640,00:17:44.880,I'm kind of in a meeting.
00:17:44.920,00:17:47.120,Can you make an appointment with my secretary?
00:17:47.160,00:17:49.960,I don't think this can wait.
00:17:50.000,00:17:53.760,"One of your traders, someone who worked in your office, was killed."
00:17:53.800,00:17:55.520,-What?
00:17:55.560,00:17:57.800,-The police are at his flat.
00:17:57.840,00:17:59.520,Sorry to interfere with everyone's digestion.
00:17:59.560,00:18:00.640,Still want to make an appointment?
00:18:00.680,00:18:03.560,Would maybe 9:00 at Scotland Yard suit?
00:18:08.240,00:18:11.000,"Harrow, Oxford."
00:18:13.760,00:18:15.560,"Worked in Asia for a while, so..."
00:18:15.600,00:18:18.080,You gave him the Hong Kong accounts?
00:18:19.880,00:18:24.000,"Lost five million in a single morning, made it all back a week later."
00:18:24.040,00:18:25.480,"Nerves of steel, Eddie had."
00:18:25.520,00:18:27.720,-Who'd want to kill him?
00:18:27.760,00:18:29.440,We don't all end up with a bullet through your temple.
00:18:29.480,00:18:32.000,-Not usually. Excuse me.
00:18:35.520,00:18:37.440,It's my chairman.
00:18:37.480,00:18:39.760,Police have been on to him.
00:18:39.800,00:18:41.320,Apparently they're telling him it was a suicide.
00:18:41.360,00:18:43.880,"Well, they've got it wrong, Sebastian. He was murdered."
00:18:45.080,00:18:47.320,"Well, I'm afraid they don't see it like that."
00:18:47.360,00:18:50.120,-So?
00:18:50.160,00:18:52.360,I hired you to do a job.
00:18:55.560,00:18:58.360,I thought bankers were all supposed to be heartless bastards.
00:19:46.800,00:19:49.520,I need you to get over to Crispians.
00:19:49.560,00:19:52.800,"Two Ming vases up for auction, Chenghua."
00:19:52.840,00:19:57.560,-Will you appraise them?
00:19:57.600,00:20:00.240,Soo Lin has resigned her job.
00:20:54.200,00:20:56.640,-Just locum work.
00:20:58.280,00:21:01.200,"You're, um..."
00:21:03.080,00:21:05.680,"Er, I could always do with the money."
00:21:05.720,00:21:10.320,"Well, we've got two away on holiday this week and one's just left to have a baby."
00:21:12.120,00:21:14.160,It might be a bit mundane for you.
00:21:14.200,00:21:16.840,"Er, no, mundane is good, sometimes."
00:21:17.880,00:21:20.000,Mundane works.
00:21:20.040,00:21:23.360,-It says here you were a soldier.
00:21:25.760,00:21:28.040,Anything else you can do?
00:21:28.080,00:21:30.640,I learnt the clarinet at school.
00:21:30.680,00:21:33.480,"Well, I look forward to it."
00:21:42.080,00:21:44.400,I said could you pass me a pen?
00:21:45.920,00:21:47.760,-What? When?
00:21:49.280,00:21:51.600,Didn't notice I'd gone out then?
00:21:55.760,00:21:58.640,-How was it?
00:21:58.680,00:21:59.760,Who?
00:22:00.800,00:22:02.400,-The job.
00:22:04.000,00:22:05.040,It.
00:22:07.120,00:22:09.120,"-Yeah, have a look."
00:22:14.080,00:22:18.000,-WATSON: The intruder who can walk through walls.
00:22:18.040,00:22:20.120,Journalist shot dead in his flat.
00:22:20.160,00:22:23.400,"Doors locked, windows bolted from the inside."
00:22:25.120,00:22:27.360,-God! You think...
00:22:36.320,00:22:41.160,"Brian Lukis, freelance journalist, murdered in his flat."
00:22:42.600,00:22:44.520,Doors locked from the inside.
00:22:44.560,00:22:46.440,"WATSON: You've got to admit, it's similar."
00:22:46.480,00:22:50.160,Both men killed by someone who can walk through solid walls.
00:22:50.200,00:22:54.040,"Inspector, do you seriously believe that Eddie Van Coon was just another city suicide?"
00:22:56.800,00:22:58.840,"You have seen the ballistics' reports, I suppose?"
00:22:58.880,00:23:00.320,Mmm.
00:23:00.360,00:23:02.240,"And the shot that killed him, was it fired from his own gun?"
00:23:02.280,00:23:03.440,-No.
00:23:03.480,00:23:07.280,So this investigation might move a bit quicker if you were to take my word as gospel.
00:23:09.640,00:23:11.920,I've just handed you a murder inquiry.
00:23:13.080,00:23:15.080,Five minutes in his flat.
00:23:43.120,00:23:45.400,Four floors up.
00:23:45.440,00:23:48.200,That's why they think they're safe.
00:23:48.240,00:23:51.360,"Put a chain across the door, bolt it shut think your impregnable."
00:23:53.600,00:23:57.680,They don't reckon for one second that there's another way in.
00:23:57.720,00:24:01.720,-I don't understand.
00:24:01.760,00:24:05.320,-What are you doing?
00:24:06.600,00:24:09.240,-That's how he got in.
00:24:09.280,00:24:13.360,"He climbed up the side of the walls, ran along the roof, dropped in through this skylight."
00:24:13.400,00:24:15.920,You're not serious?
00:24:15.960,00:24:21.080,"He scaled six floors of a Docklands apartment building, -jumped the balcony and killed Van Coon."
00:24:21.120,00:24:22.840,And of course that's how he got into the bank.
00:24:22.880,00:24:29.760,SHERLOCK: He'd run along within the ledge and on to the terrace I have to find out what connects these two men.
00:24:57.320,00:25:00.360,Date stamped on the book is the same day that he died.
00:25:09.960,00:25:11.280,Sherlock?
00:25:22.320,00:25:25.520,"So, the killer goes to the bank, leaves a threatening cipher at the bank."
00:25:25.560,00:25:28.640,"Van Coon panics, returns to his apartment, locks himself in."
00:25:28.680,00:25:30.840,"Hours later, he dies."
00:25:30.880,00:25:36.880,"The killer finds Lukis at the library, he writes the cipher on the shelf where he knows it'll be seen."
00:25:36.920,00:25:38.520,Lukis goes home.
00:25:38.560,00:25:41.200,"SHERLOCK: Late that night, he dies too."
00:25:43.120,00:25:45.400,"Why did they die, Sherlock?"
00:25:45.440,00:25:47.600,Only the cipher can tell us.
00:25:53.320,00:25:56.440,"SHERLOCK: The world's run on codes and ciphers, John."
00:25:56.480,00:25:59.960,From the million pound security system at the bank to the pin machine you took exception to.
00:26:00.000,00:26:01.840,Cryptography inhabits our every waking moment.
00:26:01.880,00:26:03.560,"WATSON: Yes, okay, but..."
00:26:03.600,00:26:08.360,"But it's all computer-generated, electronic codes, electronic ciphering methods."
00:26:08.400,00:26:11.680,This is different.
00:26:11.720,00:26:13.800,Modern code-breaking methods won't unravel it.
00:26:13.840,00:26:16.040,-Where are we headed?
00:26:16.080,00:26:17.960,What? Sorry?
00:26:19.720,00:26:21.680,You heard me perfectly.
00:26:21.720,00:26:25.400,-You need advice?
00:26:34.360,00:26:36.960,RAZ: Part of my new exhibition.
00:26:37.000,00:26:39.840,-Interesting.
00:26:39.880,00:26:42.720,Urban Bloodlust Frenzy.
00:26:42.760,00:26:44.880,Catchy.
00:26:44.920,00:26:48.400,I've got two minutes before a Community Support Officer comes around that corner.
00:26:49.400,00:26:51.800,Can we do this while I'm working?
00:26:56.320,00:26:58.400,SHERLOCK: Know the author?
00:26:58.440,00:27:00.560,I recognise the paint.
00:27:00.600,00:27:02.840,RAZ: It's like Michigan hardcore propellant.
00:27:03.400,00:27:04.680,I'd say zinc.
00:27:04.720,00:27:07.640,And what about the symbols?
00:27:07.680,00:27:10.080,I'm not even sure it's a proper language.
00:27:10.120,00:27:11.800,"Two men have been murdered, Raz."
00:27:11.840,00:27:15.040,Deciphering this is the key to finding out who killed them.
00:27:15.080,00:27:17.400,And this is all you've got to go on?
00:27:17.440,00:27:20.120,"-It's hardly much now, is it?"
00:27:21.400,00:27:22.600,I'll ask around.
00:27:22.640,00:27:24.440,Somebody must know something about it.
00:27:24.480,00:27:25.480,Oi!
00:27:28.280,00:27:29.560,What the hell do you think you're doing?
00:27:29.600,00:27:31.600,This gallery is a listed public building.
00:27:31.640,00:27:35.040,"No, no. Wait, wait."
00:27:40.760,00:27:42.480,"Bit of an enthusiast, are we?"
00:27:46.280,00:27:49.400,She was right in the middle of an important piece of restoration.
00:27:49.440,00:27:51.440,Why would she suddenly resign?
00:27:51.480,00:27:53.400,Family problems.
00:27:53.440,00:27:56.280,But she doesn't have a family.
00:27:56.320,00:27:58.880,-Andy!
00:27:58.920,00:28:01.040,They've become her obsession.
00:28:01.080,00:28:03.040,She's been working on restoring them for weeks.
00:28:03.080,00:28:07.080,I can't believe that she would just abandon them.
00:28:07.120,00:28:10.080,Perhaps she was getting a bit of unwanted attention?
00:28:22.240,00:28:24.000,You've been a while.
00:28:26.120,00:28:28.120,"Yeah, well, you know how it is."
00:28:28.160,00:28:30.800,"Custody sergeants don't really like to be hurried, do they?"
00:28:30.840,00:28:34.160,Just formalities.
00:28:30.840,00:28:36.040,"Fingerprints, charge sheet, and I've got to be in magistrates' court on Tuesday."
00:28:36.080,00:28:37.600,What?
00:28:37.640,00:28:41.400,"Me, Sherlock!"
00:28:41.440,00:28:43.160,"Good, fine."
00:28:43.200,00:28:45.760,You wanna tell your little pal he's welcome to go and own up anytime.
00:28:45.800,00:28:48.320,"This symbol, I still can't place it."
00:28:48.360,00:28:53.320,"No, I need you to go to the police station ask about the journalist, his personal effects would've been impounded."
00:28:53.360,00:28:57.000,Get hold of his diary or something that will tell us his movements.
00:28:57.040,00:28:58.960,Go and see Van Coon's PA.
00:28:59.000,00:29:01.800,"If you retrace their steps, somewhere they'll coincide."
00:29:10.440,00:29:11.960,Scotland Yard.
00:29:22.120,00:29:26.880,Flew back from Dalian Friday.
00:29:26.920,00:29:29.600,-Can you print me up a copy?
00:29:29.640,00:29:31.880,What about the day he died?
00:29:31.920,00:29:33.760,"AMANDA: Sorry, I've got a gap."
00:29:35.160,00:29:36.840,I have all his receipts.
00:29:36.880,00:29:41.440,-Your friend...
00:29:41.480,00:29:43.880,He's an arrogant sod.
00:29:48.960,00:29:51.560,"This is what you wanted, isn't it?"
00:29:57.720,00:30:00.600,"What kind of a boss was he, Amanda?"
00:30:00.640,00:30:04.280,"Um, no."
00:30:04.320,00:30:08.000,The only things Eddie appreciated had a big price tag.
00:30:08.040,00:30:10.840,Like that hand cream.
00:30:17.080,00:30:18.920,Look at this one.
00:30:18.960,00:30:21.560,"Got a taxi from home on the day he died, £18.50."
00:30:21.600,00:30:23.560,That would get him to the office.
00:30:23.600,00:30:26.400,Not rush hour. Check the time.
00:30:26.440,00:30:28.480,The West End.
00:30:30.280,00:30:32.800,"Underground, printed at one in Piccadilly."
00:30:32.840,00:30:35.320,So he got a Tube back to the office.
00:30:35.360,00:30:37.840,Why would he get a taxi into town and then the Tube back?
00:30:37.880,00:30:40.000,Because he was delivering something heavy.
00:30:40.040,00:30:42.400,You wouldn't lug a package up the escalator.
00:30:42.440,00:30:45.720,-Delivering?
00:30:45.760,00:30:47.840,"Dropped the package, delivered it, and then..."
00:30:50.280,00:30:52.640,Stopped on his way.
00:30:56.000,00:31:00.840,"So you bought your lunch from here en route to the station, but where were you headed from?"
00:31:00.880,00:31:03.280,Where did the taxi drop you?
00:31:05.240,00:31:07.320,Eddie Van Coon brought a package here the day he died.
00:31:07.360,00:31:09.080,Whatever was hidden inside that case...
00:31:09.120,00:31:11.400,I've managed to piece together a picture using scraps of information.
00:31:11.440,00:31:14.480,"Credit card bills, receipts."
00:31:14.520,00:31:16.720,-Sherlock.
00:31:16.760,00:31:19.200,"-I don't know where, but..."
00:31:20.360,00:31:21.760,How could you tell?
00:31:21.800,00:31:24.200,Lukis' diary. He was here too.
00:31:25.080,00:31:26.160,Oh.
00:31:50.960,00:31:52.440,WATSON: Hello.
00:31:58.600,00:32:00.600,You want lucky cat?
00:32:01.720,00:32:03.240,"WATSON: No, thanks, no."
00:32:04.120,00:32:06.360,£10! £10!
00:32:06.400,00:32:07.800,Ooh!
00:32:07.840,00:32:10.240,"I think your wife, she will like."
00:32:11.040,00:32:12.520,"Um, thank you."
00:32:21.240,00:32:22.600,Sherlock.
00:32:24.360,00:32:26.240,The label there.
00:32:26.280,00:32:28.880,-It's exactly the same as the cipher.
00:32:34.840,00:32:38.360,"It's an ancient number system, Hangzhou."
00:32:38.400,00:32:40.760,These days only street traders use it.
00:32:40.800,00:32:44.000,Those were numbers written on the wall at the bank and at the library.
00:32:44.040,00:32:46.280,Numbers written in an ancient Chinese dialect.
00:32:47.080,00:32:48.800,WATSON: It's a 15.
00:32:48.840,00:32:51.320,"What we thought was the artist's tag, it's a number 15."
00:32:51.360,00:32:54.760,"And the blindfold, the horizontal line."
00:32:54.800,00:32:57.080,"-The Chinese number one, John."
00:33:02.680,00:33:10.200,"WATSON: Two men, travel back from China, both head straight for the Lucky Cat emporium."
00:33:10.840,00:33:13.000,What did they see?
00:33:13.040,00:33:15.280,It's not what they saw.
00:33:15.320,00:33:18.280,It's what they both brought back in those suitcases.
00:33:18.320,00:33:20.200,And you don't mean duty free.
00:33:21.800,00:33:23.160,Thank you.
00:33:27.760,00:33:29.240,Think about what Sebastian told us.
00:33:29.280,00:33:31.960,"About Van Coon, about how he stayed afloat in the market."
00:33:32.000,00:33:34.920,-Lost five million.
00:33:34.960,00:33:37.120,That's how he made such easy money.
00:33:37.160,00:33:39.600,He was a smuggler. Mmm.
00:33:39.640,00:33:40.960,I reckon he would have been perfect.
00:33:42.760,00:33:45.240,"Businessman, making frequent trips to Asia."
00:33:45.280,00:33:48.840,"Lukis was the same, a journalist writing about China."
00:33:48.880,00:33:51.120,Both of them smuggled stuff about.
00:33:51.160,00:33:53.480,The Lucky Cat was their drop-off.
00:33:54.200,00:33:56.080,But why did they die?
00:33:56.120,00:34:04.760,"It doesn't make sense, if the both turn up at the shop and deliver the goods why would someone threaten them and kill them after the event, after they'd finished the job?"
00:34:08.760,00:34:10.360,What if one of them was light-fingered?
00:34:10.400,00:34:12.480,-How do you mean?
00:34:12.520,00:34:14.520,Something from the hoard.
00:34:14.560,00:34:16.600,And the killer doesn't know which of them took it so he threatens them both.
00:34:16.640,00:34:17.640,Right.
00:34:20.280,00:34:22.240,Remind me.
00:34:22.280,00:34:24.320,When was the last time that it rained?
00:34:33.680,00:34:36.000,It's been here since Monday.
00:34:46.920,00:34:50.080,SHERLOCK: No one's been in that flat for at least three days.
00:34:50.120,00:34:52.960,WATSON: Could have gone on holiday.
00:34:53.000,00:34:55.000,Do you leave your windows open when you go on holiday?
00:35:05.280,00:35:06.680,Sherlock!
00:35:14.360,00:35:17.000,Someone else has been here.
00:35:17.040,00:35:20.600,"Somebody else broke into the flat and knocked over the vase, just like I did."
00:35:31.600,00:35:33.600,WATSON: Do you think maybe you could let me in this time?
00:35:38.840,00:35:40.680,"Can you not keep doing this, please?"
00:35:47.560,00:35:48.760,I'm not the first!
00:35:50.960,00:35:52.040,What?
00:35:52.080,00:35:55.040,Somebody's been in here before me!
00:35:55.080,00:35:56.560,WATSON: What are you saying?
00:35:59.280,00:36:00.880,Size eight feet.
00:36:02.400,00:36:06.400,"Small, but athletic."
00:36:07.520,00:36:09.160,I'm wasting my breath.
00:36:13.280,00:36:15.680,"Small, strong hands."
00:36:18.400,00:36:19.800,Our acrobat.
00:36:21.160,00:36:23.600,Why didn't he close the window when he left...
00:36:23.640,00:36:26.000,"Oh, stupid, stupid!"
00:36:26.600,00:36:27.840,Obvious.
00:36:28.520,00:36:30.000,He's still here.
00:36:53.400,00:36:55.480,Any time you want to include me...
00:36:55.520,00:36:56.800,John...
00:36:57.680,00:36:58.880,John!
00:37:01.080,00:37:05.880,"Oh, I'm Sherlock Holmes and I always work alone because no-one else can compete with my massive intellect!"
00:37:48.440,00:37:51.000,The milk's gone off and the washing started to smell.
00:37:51.040,00:37:53.080,Somebody left here in a hurry three days ago.
00:37:53.120,00:37:54.800,Somebody?
00:37:54.840,00:37:57.480,We have to find her.
00:37:57.520,00:37:58.960,"How, exactly?"
00:38:03.880,00:38:06.120,We could start with this.
00:38:06.160,00:38:07.640,You've gone all croaky.
00:38:11.480,00:38:13.840,When was the last time that you saw her?
00:38:13.880,00:38:17.160,ANDY: Three days ago.
00:38:17.200,00:38:19.560,This morning they told me she'd resigned.
00:38:19.600,00:38:22.360,Just like that.
00:38:23.880,00:38:27.360,What was the last thing that she did on her final afternoon?
00:38:31.280,00:38:37.000,"She does this demonstration for the tourists, a tea ceremony."
00:38:37.040,00:38:41.280,So she would have packed up her things and just put them in here.
00:39:00.280,00:39:02.840,-We have to get to Soo Lin Yao.
00:39:02.880,00:39:04.080,Sherlock!
00:39:04.120,00:39:05.920,"WATSON: Oh, look who it is."
00:39:06.760,00:39:08.080,Found something you'll like.
00:39:15.080,00:39:18.120,"Tuesday morning, all you've got to do is turn up and say the bag was yours."
00:39:18.160,00:39:20.360,Forget about your court date.
00:39:25.360,00:39:27.520,"GIRL: Dude, that was rad!"
00:39:29.560,00:39:33.960,"You want to hide a tree, then a forest is the best place to do it, wouldn't you say?"
00:39:34.000,00:39:38.680,"People would just walk straight past, not knowing, unable to decipher the message."
00:39:40.440,00:39:43.560,There. I spotted it earlier.
00:39:43.600,00:39:46.280,They've been here.
00:39:46.320,00:39:47.680,RAZ: Yeah.
00:39:47.720,00:39:51.040,"SHERLOCK: John, if we're going to decipher this code, we're gonna need to look for more evidence."
00:40:53.040,00:40:55.360,Answer your phone.
00:41:12.200,00:41:14.120,WATSON: It's been painted over.
00:41:17.080,00:41:20.120,I don't understand.
00:41:22.680,00:41:26.120,Ten minutes ago. I saw it.
00:41:26.160,00:41:29.840,Somebody doesn't want me to see it.
00:41:29.880,00:41:32.080,"-Sherlock, what are you..."
00:41:32.120,00:41:33.760,I need you to concentrate.
00:41:33.800,00:41:37.360,What? Why? Why?
00:41:37.400,00:41:39.680,I need you to maximise your visual memory.
00:41:39.720,00:41:43.600,-Try to picture what you saw.
00:41:43.640,00:41:45.280,-Can you remember it?
00:41:45.320,00:41:46.640,-Can you remember the pattern?
00:41:46.680,00:41:48.520,-How much can you remember it?
00:41:48.560,00:41:52.560,Because the average human memory on visual matters is only 62% accurate.
00:41:52.600,00:41:54.680,"-Yeah, well, don't worry, I remember all of it."
00:41:54.720,00:41:59.000,"Yeah. Well, at least I would, if I could get to my pockets."
00:42:20.000,00:42:21.640,"Always in pairs, John, look."
00:42:21.680,00:42:22.720,Mmm?
00:42:23.680,00:42:25.600,Numbers.
00:42:25.640,00:42:26.840,Come with partners.
00:42:26.880,00:42:28.480,"God, I need to sleep."
00:42:28.520,00:42:31.520,-Why did he paint it so near the tracks?
00:42:31.560,00:42:33.560,Thousands of people pass by there every day.
00:42:33.600,00:42:35.280,Just 20 minutes.
00:42:36.640,00:42:38.560,Of course.
00:42:38.600,00:42:40.160,"Of course, he wants information."
00:42:40.200,00:42:42.320,He's trying to communicate with his people in the underworld.
00:42:42.360,00:42:45.240,Whatever was stolen he wants it back.
00:42:45.280,00:42:47.560,"It's somewhere here, in a code."
00:42:49.160,00:42:52.120,We can't crack this without Soo Lin Yao.
00:42:52.160,00:42:54.080,"Oh, good."
00:42:54.120,00:42:56.720,Two men who travelled back from China were murdered.
00:42:56.760,00:42:59.680,And their killer left them messages in Hangzhou numerals.
00:42:59.720,00:43:01.920,Soo Lin Yao is in danger.
00:43:01.960,00:43:04.560,"That cipher, it was just the same pattern as the others."
00:43:04.600,00:43:06.520,He means to kill her as well.
00:43:06.560,00:43:10.840,"Look, I've tried everywhere, friends, colleagues."
00:43:10.880,00:43:15.000,"I mean, she could be a thousand miles away."
00:43:15.040,00:43:18.280,-What are you looking at?
00:43:18.320,00:43:22.600,The pots were her obsession.
00:43:22.640,00:43:25.440,"If they dry out, then the clay can start to crumble."
00:43:25.480,00:43:28.640,"Apparently, you have to just keep making tea in them."
00:43:28.680,00:43:31.720,"Yesterday, only one of those pots were shining."
00:43:32.480,00:43:34.200,"Now, there are two."
00:44:24.480,00:44:26.520,-Fancy a biscuit with that?
00:44:28.680,00:44:31.800,Centuries old.
00:44:38.840,00:44:40.000,Hello.
00:44:41.000,00:44:43.560,You saw the cipher.
00:44:43.600,00:44:46.200,Then you know he is coming for me.
00:44:46.240,00:44:48.520,You've been clever to avoid him so far.
00:44:49.760,00:44:51.360,I had to finish.
00:44:52.160,00:44:53.480,To finish this work.
00:44:55.800,00:44:58.040,It's only a matter of time.
00:44:58.080,00:45:00.600,I know he will find me.
00:45:00.640,00:45:02.400,Who is he?
00:45:04.960,00:45:08.080,"When I was a girl, we met in China."
00:45:10.280,00:45:12.000,I recognised his...
00:45:13.000,00:45:15.080,-signature.
00:45:17.120,00:45:18.960,Only he would do this.
00:45:20.160,00:45:21.400,Zhi Zhu.
00:45:22.280,00:45:24.320,-Zhi Zhu?
00:45:30.280,00:45:31.680,SOO LIN: You know this mark?
00:45:31.720,00:45:35.880,-Yes. It's the mark of a Tong.
00:45:35.920,00:45:38.600,"Ancient crime syndicate, based in China."
00:45:41.480,00:45:43.920,Every foot soldier bears the mark.
00:45:45.680,00:45:47.840,Everyone who hauls for them.
00:45:48.760,00:45:49.960,Hauls?
00:45:52.000,00:45:53.800,You... You mean you were a smuggler?
00:45:58.080,00:45:59.800,I was 15.
00:46:01.840,00:46:03.440,My parents were dead.
00:46:04.680,00:46:06.480,I had no livelihood.
00:46:07.960,00:46:13.800,"No way of surviving, day-to-day, except to work for the bosses."
00:46:13.840,00:46:14.960,Who are they?
00:46:16.120,00:46:18.920,They are called the Black Lotus.
00:46:22.600,00:46:31.640,"By the time I was 16, I was taking thousands of pounds worth of drugs across the border into Hong Kong."
00:46:35.800,00:46:38.440,I managed to leave that life behind me.
00:46:40.240,00:46:41.920,I came to England.
00:46:44.120,00:46:46.120,"They gave me a job, here."
00:46:49.320,00:46:51.200,Everything was good.
00:46:52.160,00:46:53.560,New life.
00:46:53.600,00:46:55.760,And he came looking for you.
00:46:56.360,00:46:57.520,Yes.
00:47:00.040,00:47:05.640,"I hoped, after five years maybe they would have forgotten me."
00:47:07.120,00:47:09.560,But they never really let you leave.
00:47:11.880,00:47:18.200,"A small community like ours, they are never very far away."
00:47:23.760,00:47:25.920,He came to my flat.
00:47:25.960,00:47:30.400,He asked me to help him to track down something that was stolen.
00:47:30.440,00:47:32.120,And you've no idea what it was?
00:47:32.960,00:47:35.320,I refused to help.
00:47:35.360,00:47:38.720,"So, you knew him well when you were living back in China?"
00:47:40.960,00:47:42.280,"Oh, yes."
00:47:45.200,00:47:46.240,He's my brother.
00:48:00.680,00:48:02.200,Two orphans.
00:48:04.600,00:48:06.560,We had no choice.
00:48:08.280,00:48:13.280,We could work for the Black Lotus or starve on the streets like beggars.
00:48:18.680,00:48:22.120,My brother has become their puppet.
00:48:22.160,00:48:25.400,In the power of the one they call Shan.
00:48:26.800,00:48:28.200,The Black Lotus general.
00:48:32.120,00:48:34.120,I turned my brother away.
00:48:36.480,00:48:38.560,He said I had betrayed him.
00:48:41.160,00:48:45.920,"Next day, I came to work and the cipher was waiting."
00:48:52.760,00:48:55.600,SHERLOCK: Can you decipher these?
00:48:55.640,00:48:59.000,-These are numbers.
00:48:59.040,00:49:03.640,"Here, the line across the man's eyes, it's the Chinese number one."
00:49:03.680,00:49:06.680,And this one is 15.
00:49:08.080,00:49:10.520,All the smugglers know it.
00:49:10.560,00:49:11.760,It's based upon a book...
00:49:17.160,00:49:18.720,He's here.
00:49:19.280,00:49:23.880,Zhi Zhu has found me.
00:49:23.920,00:49:27.160,"WATSON: No, no, Sherlock."
00:49:27.200,00:49:29.720,Come here. Get in. Get in!
00:49:45.880,00:49:48.160,I have to go and help him.
00:50:20.320,00:50:22.520,-Careful!
00:50:22.560,00:50:26.840,"Some of those skulls are over 200,000 years old, have a bit of respect!"
00:51:46.560,00:51:47.920,"Oh, my God."
00:52:20.680,00:52:24.680,How many murders is it going to take before you start believing that this maniac's out there?
00:52:26.960,00:52:29.080,A young girl was gunned down tonight.
00:52:29.120,00:52:31.560,That's three victims in three days.
00:52:31.600,00:52:33.600,You're supposed to be finding him.
00:52:33.640,00:52:36.720,Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon were working for a gang of international smugglers.
00:52:36.760,00:52:41.680,A gang called the Black Lotus operating here in London right under your nose.
00:52:43.000,00:52:44.600,Can you prove that?
00:52:51.520,00:52:55.440,-What are you thinking?
00:52:55.480,00:52:58.720,"I suppose it's never going to trouble Egon Ronay, is it?"
00:52:58.760,00:53:00.600,I'd stick with the pasta.
00:53:00.640,00:53:04.680,"Don't want to be doing roast pork, not if you're slicing up cadavers."
00:53:05.560,00:53:07.000,What are you having?
00:53:07.040,00:53:09.720,I don't eat when I'm working.
00:53:09.760,00:53:11.680,So you're working here tonight?
00:53:11.720,00:53:14.040,-Need to examine some bodies.
00:53:14.080,00:53:16.880,Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis.
00:53:16.920,00:53:18.640,They're on my list.
00:53:20.000,00:53:22.480,Could you wheel them out again for me?
00:53:22.520,00:53:26.040,Well...their paperwork's already gone through.
00:53:30.360,00:53:33.240,-You changed your hair.
00:53:33.280,00:53:36.000,The style.
00:53:36.040,00:53:38.560,"-Yes, well..."
00:53:39.720,00:53:40.960,Suits you better this way.
00:53:51.680,00:53:53.880,We're just interested in the feet.
00:53:53.920,00:53:55.280,-The feet?
00:53:55.320,00:53:58.000,Do you mind if we have a look at them?
00:54:05.240,00:54:06.720,"Now, Van Coon."
00:54:13.200,00:54:14.240,Oh!
00:54:14.880,00:54:16.920,So...
00:54:16.960,00:54:21.280,So either these two men just happened to visit the same Chinese tattoo parlour or I'm telling the truth.
00:54:21.320,00:54:22.720,What do you want?
00:54:22.760,00:54:25.440,I want every book from Lukis' apartment and Van Coon's.
00:54:25.480,00:54:26.880,Their books?
00:54:30.720,00:54:33.280,Not just a criminal organisation.
00:54:33.320,00:54:34.400,It's a cult.
00:54:36.720,00:54:39.200,Her brother was corrupted by one of its leaders.
00:54:39.240,00:54:40.600,Soo Lin said the name.
00:54:40.640,00:54:42.280,"Yes, Shan."
00:54:42.320,00:54:43.400,General Shan.
00:54:43.440,00:54:44.720,We're still no closer to finding him.
00:54:44.760,00:54:48.040,Wrong! We've got almost all we need to know.
00:54:48.080,00:54:51.400,She gave us most of the missing pieces.
00:54:51.440,00:54:54.360,Why did he need to visit his sister? Why did he need her expertise?
00:54:54.400,00:54:55.680,-She worked at the museum.
00:54:55.720,00:54:57.680,An expert in antiquities.
00:54:58.480,00:55:00.440,"Mmm. Of course, I see."
00:55:00.480,00:55:04.080,"Valuable antiquities, John."
00:55:04.120,00:55:07.240,China's home to a thousand treasures hidden after Mao's revolution.
00:55:07.280,00:55:08.520,The Black Lotus is selling them.
00:55:14.160,00:55:16.960,-Check for the dates...
00:55:17.000,00:55:18.600,Arrived from China four days ago.
00:55:19.760,00:55:21.760,Anonymous.
00:55:21.800,00:55:23.960,The vendor doesn't give his name.
00:55:24.000,00:55:26.440,Two undiscovered treasures from the East.
00:55:26.480,00:55:29.840,One in Lukis' suitcase and one in Van Coon's.
00:55:30.720,00:55:34.720,SHERLOCK: Antiquities sold at auction.
00:55:36.200,00:55:38.080,"Look, here's another one."
00:55:38.120,00:55:43.720,"Arrived from China a month ago, Chinese ceramic statue sold, 400,000."
00:55:43.760,00:55:46.960,"Look, a month before that, Chinese painting, half a million."
00:55:47.000,00:55:49.680,All of them from an anonymous source.
00:55:49.720,00:55:52.480,They're stealing them back in China and one by one they're feeding them into Britain.
00:55:52.520,00:55:53.560,Ah!
00:55:56.240,00:56:00.880,"WATSON: Well, every single auction coincides with Lukis or Van Coon travelling to China."
00:56:00.920,00:56:02.760,"So, what if one of them got greedy when they were in China?"
00:56:02.800,00:56:04.440,What if one of them stole something?
00:56:04.480,00:56:05.880,That's why Zhi Zhu's come.
00:56:07.120,00:56:09.840,"Sorry, are we collecting for charity, Sherlock?"
00:56:09.880,00:56:13.440,-What?
00:56:19.800,00:56:21.760,So the numbers are references.
00:56:21.800,00:56:23.160,To books.
00:56:23.200,00:56:26.400,To specific pages and specific words on those pages.
00:56:26.960,00:56:28.880,Right. So...
00:56:28.920,00:56:30.600,"15 and 1, that means?"
00:56:30.640,00:56:32.640,Turn to page 15 and it's the first word you read.
00:56:32.680,00:56:35.640,"-Okay, so what's the message?"
00:56:35.680,00:56:38.440,That's the cunning of the book code.
00:56:38.480,00:56:41.000,It has to be one that they both own.
00:56:43.440,00:56:46.800,"Okay, fine."
00:57:00.840,00:57:05.200,We found these at the museum.
00:57:05.240,00:57:08.520,"Er, we hoped Soo Lin could decipher it for us."
00:57:08.560,00:57:09.840,Tough.
00:57:10.880,00:57:12.800,Anything else I can do?
00:57:13.520,00:57:15.000,"To assist you, I mean."
00:57:15.040,00:57:17.360,Some silence right now would be marvelous.
00:57:32.200,00:57:33.600,Cigarette.
00:57:35.680,00:57:36.800,Uh...
00:58:02.200,00:58:03.560,Imagine.
00:58:18.000,00:58:19.080,Oh.
00:58:25.120,00:58:29.760,"I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but we haven't got anything now until next Thursday."
00:58:29.800,00:58:31.960,WOMAN 1: This is taking ages.
00:58:32.000,00:58:34.080,"RECEPTIONIST: Ah, sorry."
00:58:34.120,00:58:37.280,WOMAN 2: What's the point of taking appointment if they can't even speak to me?
00:58:37.320,00:58:39.800,"Um, what's going on?"
00:58:39.840,00:58:44.800,"That new doctor you hired, he hasn't buzzed the intercom for ages."
00:58:44.840,00:58:46.760,-Let me go and have a word.
00:58:46.800,00:58:48.720,-Excuse me.
00:58:49.600,00:58:51.440,-John?
00:58:54.880,00:58:56.200,John?
00:59:06.920,00:59:11.000,Looks like I'm done.
00:59:11.040,00:59:14.360,"-Oh, I did one or two of yours."
00:59:14.400,00:59:16.640,"Well, maybe five or six."
00:59:18.000,00:59:19.600,"I'm sorry, that's not very professional."
00:59:19.640,00:59:21.600,"No. No, not really."
00:59:22.440,00:59:24.600,I had...a bit of a late one.
00:59:26.080,00:59:27.400,"Oh, right."
00:59:29.800,00:59:31.240,"Anyway, see you."
00:59:31.280,00:59:35.520,So...what were you doing to keep you up so late?
00:59:35.560,00:59:38.880,I was attending a sort of book event.
00:59:38.920,00:59:42.720,"Oh. Oh, she likes books, does she, your girlfriend?"
00:59:43.520,00:59:44.880,"No, it wasn't a date."
00:59:44.920,00:59:48.440,"-Good. I mean, I'm..."
00:59:51.760,00:59:54.040,A book that everybody would own.
01:00:03.800,01:00:05.960,"Fifteen, entry one."
01:00:20.120,01:00:21.680,I need to get some air.
01:00:21.720,01:00:24.680,"-Actually, I've got a date."
01:00:24.720,01:00:27.720,Where two people who like each other go out and have fun?
01:00:27.760,01:00:30.960,-That's what I was suggesting.
01:00:31.000,01:00:32.480,"At least, I hope not."
01:00:32.520,01:00:34.240,-Where are you taking her?
01:00:34.280,01:00:36.600,"Er, dull, boring, predictable."
01:00:37.720,01:00:39.400,Why don't you try this?
01:00:39.440,01:00:41.400,In London for one night only.
01:00:43.280,01:00:45.920,"Thanks, but I don't come to you for dating advice."
01:00:45.960,01:00:48.360,SARAH: It's years since anyone took me to the circus.
01:00:48.400,01:00:50.600,"WATSON: Right, yes."
01:00:50.640,01:00:54.880,"Well, a friend recommended it to me I phoned up."
01:00:54.920,01:00:57.120,"Oh! What are they, a touring company or something?"
01:00:57.160,01:00:59.480,I don't know much about it.
01:00:59.520,01:01:01.360,SARAH: I think they're probably from China.
01:01:01.400,01:01:05.600,"I think so, yes."
01:01:05.640,01:01:09.040,"That's wonderful, thank you very much."
01:01:09.080,01:01:11.120,"Hi, I have two tickets reserved for tonight."
01:01:11.160,01:01:13.440,-And what's the name?
01:01:16.600,01:01:19.920,"Actually, I have three in that name."
01:01:19.960,01:01:22.080,"No, I don't think so, we only booked two."
01:01:22.120,01:01:25.280,Then I phoned back and got one for myself as well.
01:01:26.000,01:01:27.440,I'm Sherlock.
01:01:29.920,01:01:31.800,-Hi.
01:01:35.760,01:01:38.000,You couldn't let me have just one night off.
01:01:38.040,01:01:41.560,"Yellow Dragon Circus, in London for one day."
01:01:41.600,01:01:43.240,The Tong sent an assassin to England...
01:01:43.280,01:01:45.360,Dressed as a tightrope walker?
01:01:45.400,01:01:47.560,"We're looking for a killer who can climb, who can shin up a rope."
01:01:47.600,01:01:50.520,Where else would you find that level of dexterity?
01:01:50.560,01:01:52.360,Exit visas are scarce in China.
01:01:52.400,01:01:54.240,They need a pretty good reason to get out of that country.
01:01:54.280,01:01:56.000,"Now, all I need to do is have a quick look around the place."
01:01:56.040,01:01:57.520,Fine. You do that.
01:01:57.560,01:01:59.320,I need your help.
01:01:59.360,01:02:01.240,I do have a couple of other things on my mind this evening.
01:02:01.280,01:02:02.720,Like what?
01:02:03.360,01:02:05.400,You are kidding?
01:02:05.440,01:02:07.840,-What's so important?
01:02:07.880,01:02:10.400,You're going to chase some killer while I'm trying to...
01:02:10.440,01:02:11.800,What?
01:02:11.840,01:02:14.400,to get off with Sarah.
01:02:14.440,01:02:16.720,Hey... Ready?
01:02:16.760,01:02:17.880,Yeah.
01:02:28.040,01:02:30.280,This is not a circus.
01:02:30.320,01:02:32.120,Look at the size of this crowd.
01:02:32.160,01:02:35.800,"Sherlock, this is...art."
01:02:35.840,01:02:37.880,-This is not their day job.
01:02:37.920,01:02:40.160,"They're not a circus, they're a gang of international smugglers."
01:04:14.680,01:04:16.760,Classic Chinese escapology act.
01:04:16.800,01:04:20.400,-Hmm?
01:04:20.440,01:04:23.440,The warrior has to escape his bonds before it fires.
01:04:43.880,01:04:45.160,-Oh!
01:04:45.200,01:04:46.440,Oh.
01:04:58.200,01:05:01.600,"She splits the sandbag, the sand pours out."
01:05:01.640,01:05:04.000,"Gradually, the weight lowers into the bowl."
01:05:43.720,01:05:45.880,-Thank God.
01:06:17.440,01:06:31.320,"Ladies and gentlemen, from the distant moonlit shores of the Yangtze River, we present, for your pleasure, the deadly Chinese bird spider."
01:06:41.120,01:06:42.760,Did you see that?
01:07:05.120,01:07:06.600,"Well, well."
01:07:36.160,01:07:37.720,Found you.
01:08:43.000,01:08:46.040,-Come on.
01:08:46.080,01:08:49.760,I sent a couple of cars.
01:08:49.800,01:08:52.120,"Look, I saw the mark at the circus."
01:08:52.160,01:08:55.320,"The tattoo that we saw on the two bodies, the mark of the Tong."
01:08:55.360,01:08:58.040,Lukis and Van Coon were part of a smuggling operation.
01:08:58.080,01:09:00.440,"Now, one of them stole something when they were in China."
01:09:00.480,01:09:02.120,Something valuable.
01:09:02.160,01:09:03.440,These circus performers were gang members sent here to get it back.
01:09:03.480,01:09:04.560,Get what back?
01:09:06.240,01:09:07.840,We don't know.
01:09:07.880,01:09:09.400,You don't know?
01:09:10.720,01:09:13.880,"Mr Holmes, I've done everything you asked."
01:09:13.920,01:09:17.000,"Lestrade, he seems to think your advice is worth something."
01:09:17.040,01:09:18.760,I gave the order for a raid.
01:09:18.800,01:09:20.840,Please tell me I'll have something to show for it.
01:09:20.880,01:09:23.480,Other than a massive bill for overtime.
01:09:28.600,01:09:30.160,They'll be back in China by tomorrow.
01:09:30.200,01:09:33.320,"No, they won't leave without what they came for."
01:09:33.360,01:09:35.120,We need to find a hideout.
01:09:35.160,01:09:37.760,A rendezvous.
01:09:37.800,01:09:40.600,Somewhere in this message it must tell us.
01:09:45.400,01:09:47.440,"Well, I think perhaps I should leave you to it."
01:09:47.480,01:09:48.880,"No, you don't have to go."
01:09:48.920,01:09:50.080,"-Yes, it'd be better if you left now."
01:09:54.720,01:09:58.000,-Is it just me or is anyone else starving?
01:10:11.240,01:10:13.920,So this is what you do.
01:10:13.960,01:10:16.920,"You and John, you solve puzzles for a living."
01:10:16.960,01:10:18.600,Consulting detective.
01:10:19.640,01:10:20.920,Oh.
01:10:22.000,01:10:23.080,Oh!
01:10:26.480,01:10:28.360,What are these squiggles?
01:10:28.400,01:10:32.400,They're numbers.
01:10:32.440,01:10:35.760,"Oh, right. Well, of course I should have known that."
01:10:41.080,01:10:44.840,and a bowl of nibbles.
01:10:44.880,01:10:46.760,"Mrs Hudson, you are a saint."
01:10:46.800,01:10:49.000,"If it was Monday, I'd have been to the supermarket."
01:10:49.040,01:10:51.040,Thank you. Thank you.
01:10:57.640,01:11:00.480,"-So these numbers, it's a cipher?"
01:11:00.520,01:11:02.160,And each pair of numbers is a word?
01:11:03.840,01:11:05.280,How did you know that?
01:11:05.320,01:11:07.920,"Well, two words have already been translated, here."
01:11:10.480,01:11:11.840,-John.
01:11:12.960,01:11:15.440,"John, look at this."
01:11:15.480,01:11:18.640,"Soo Lin at the museum, she started to translate the code for us."
01:11:18.680,01:11:20.320,We didn't see it.
01:11:21.080,01:11:23.040,"Nine, mill."
01:11:25.040,01:11:26.520,Does that mean millions?
01:11:26.560,01:11:28.880,Nine million quid. For what?
01:11:30.760,01:11:32.600,We need to know the end of this sentence.
01:11:32.640,01:11:35.360,-Where are you going?
01:11:35.400,01:11:37.960,-We must have been staring right at it.
01:11:38.000,01:11:40.400,"The book, John. The book."
01:11:40.440,01:11:43.360,Soo Lin used it to do this.
01:11:40.440,01:11:47.000,"Whilst we were running around the gallery, she started to translate the code."
01:11:49.040,01:11:50.160,Taxi!
01:11:51.960,01:12:21.560,"Entschuldigen Sie, bitte, A book that everybody would own."
01:12:25.400,01:12:27.440,"Please, wait! Bitte!"
01:12:29.240,01:12:31.840,Was wollt er?
01:12:31.880,01:12:33.920,"-Hey, du, was machst du?"
01:12:33.960,01:12:36.200,Gib mir doch mein Buch zuruck!
01:12:38.560,01:12:40.360,"Yeah. No, absolutely."
01:12:40.400,01:12:43.680,"I mean, well, quiet night in is just what the doctor ordered."
01:12:43.720,01:12:44.800,"Ha, ha, ha."
01:12:55.320,01:12:57.880,"Er, shall we get a takeaway?"
01:12:58.640,01:12:59.760,Yeah.
01:13:01.680,01:13:04.880,"Page 15, entry one."
01:13:08.600,01:13:10.600,Deadman.
01:13:10.640,01:13:12.640,You were threatening to kill them.
01:13:12.680,01:13:14.640,That's the first cipher.
01:13:18.760,01:13:20.680,"9, 0, 15."
01:13:21.160,01:13:23.000,"Er, 15 and 36."
01:13:28.000,01:13:29.040,39.
01:13:34.160,01:13:36.600,"Nine, mill, for..."
01:13:47.640,01:13:50.840,"Blimey, that was quick."
01:13:50.880,01:13:54.000,Do you want me to lay the table?
01:13:54.040,01:13:55.960,-Um...eat off trays?
01:13:58.480,01:14:00.360,"70, 35."
01:14:04.240,01:14:05.360,Jade.
01:14:05.960,01:14:07.200,Jade.
01:14:09.920,01:14:11.320,Sorry to keep you.
01:14:11.360,01:14:13.640,-Do you have it?
01:14:13.680,01:14:16.440,-Do you have the treasure?
01:14:30.840,01:14:34.360,Nine mill for...Jade pin.
01:14:35.240,01:14:37.040,"Dragon den, black..."
01:14:38.560,01:14:39.880,tramway.
01:14:49.520,01:14:51.920,"SHERLOCK: John! John, I've got it."
01:14:51.960,01:14:55.640,"The cipher, the book."
01:15:12.080,01:15:18.160,"WOMAN: A book is like a magic garden, carried in your pocket."
01:15:33.040,01:15:35.480,"Chinese proverb, Mr Holmes."
01:15:35.960,01:15:37.440,I'm...
01:15:37.480,01:15:39.280,I'm not Sherlock Holmes.
01:15:39.320,01:15:42.320,Forgive me if I do not take your word for it.
01:15:42.840,01:15:44.120,Ow!
01:15:48.320,01:15:51.040,"Debit card, name of S Holmes."
01:15:51.080,01:15:52.400,Take my card.
01:15:52.440,01:15:55.680,"Yes, that's not actually mine."
01:15:55.720,01:16:01.480,"And a cheque for £5,000 made out in the name of Mr Sherlock Holmes."
01:16:01.520,01:16:04.920,"Yeah, he gave me that to look after."
01:16:04.960,01:16:09.120,"Tickets from the theatre collected by you, name of Holmes."
01:16:09.160,01:16:10.520,"-Yes, okay."
01:16:10.560,01:16:13.480,"-Er, Holmes."
01:16:13.520,01:16:15.040,But I'm not him.
01:16:15.080,01:16:18.800,-We heard it from your own mouth.
01:16:18.840,01:16:22.600,I am Sherlock Holmes and I always work alone.
01:16:22.640,01:16:25.400,Because no one else can compete with my massive intellect.
01:16:31.240,01:16:35.840,I suppose there's no use me trying to persuade you I was doing an impression.
01:16:38.080,01:16:39.400,I am Shan.
01:16:41.680,01:16:43.520,You're... You're Shan?
01:16:43.560,01:16:47.840,"Three times we tried to kill you and your companion, Mr Holmes."
01:16:47.880,01:16:51.600,What does it tell you when an assassin cannot shoot straight?
01:17:06.120,01:17:09.480,It tells you that they're not really trying.
01:17:11.760,01:17:13.000,Tramway.
01:17:29.200,01:17:30.360,There.
01:17:34.160,01:17:36.360,Not blank bullets now.
01:17:38.160,01:17:41.440,"If we wanted to kill you, Mr Holmes, we would have done it by now."
01:17:41.480,01:17:44.280,We just wanted to make you inquisitive.
01:17:47.200,01:17:49.400,-Do you have it?
01:17:49.440,01:17:52.840,-The treasure.
01:17:52.880,01:17:55.400,I would prefer to make certain.
01:18:00.520,01:18:03.480,Everything in the West has its price.
01:18:03.520,01:18:07.360,"And the price for her life, information."
01:18:14.800,01:18:16.600,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
01:18:32.320,01:18:35.120,-Where's the hairpin?
01:18:35.160,01:18:38.640,The Empress pin valued at nine million sterling?
01:18:38.680,01:18:46.680,"We already had a buyer in the West and then one of our people was greedy, he took it, brought it back to London, and you, Mr Holmes, have been searching."
01:18:46.720,01:18:49.960,"Please, please. Listen to me."
01:18:50.000,01:18:52.920,I'm not Sherlock Holmes.
01:18:52.960,01:18:54.960,I haven't found whatever it is you're looking for.
01:18:55.000,01:18:58.800,-I need a volunteer from the audience.
01:18:58.840,01:19:01.600,"Ah, thank you, lady."
01:19:01.640,01:19:05.640,"Yes, you'll do very nicely."
01:19:26.960,01:19:43.120,"Ladies and gentlemen, from the distant, moonlit shores of NW1, we present for your pleasure, Sherlock Holmes' pretty companion in a death-defying act."
01:19:43.160,01:19:44.280,Please!
01:19:47.560,01:19:51.240,You've seen the act before.
01:19:51.920,01:19:53.560,You know how it ends.
01:19:53.600,01:19:57.000,-I'm not Sherlock Holmes!
01:19:57.040,01:19:59.320,"You should, you know."
01:19:59.360,01:20:02.600,Sherlock Holmes is nothing at all like him.
01:20:02.640,01:20:04.560,"How would you describe me, John?"
01:20:04.600,01:20:07.560,Resourceful? Dynamic?
01:20:07.600,01:20:08.760,Late?
01:20:10.640,01:20:14.480,"If you fire it, the bullet will travel at over 1,000 metres per second."
01:20:14.520,01:20:16.920,-Well?
01:20:16.960,01:20:18.920,...the radius curvature of these walls is nearly four metres.
01:20:18.960,01:20:21.120,"If you miss, the bullet will ricochet."
01:20:21.160,01:20:22.600,Could hit anyone.
01:20:22.640,01:20:25.560,Might even bounce off the tunnel and hit you.
01:21:45.960,01:21:47.080,It's all right.
01:21:49.960,01:21:52.360,You're going to be all right.
01:21:58.160,01:21:59.560,Don't worry.
01:22:00.480,01:22:02.040,Next date won't be like this.
01:22:16.320,01:22:18.680,We'll just slip off.
01:22:18.720,01:22:21.880,-Mr Holmes...
01:22:21.920,01:22:24.200,A glittering career.
01:22:24.240,01:22:26.200,I go where you point me.
01:22:28.120,01:22:29.360,Exactly.
01:22:36.280,01:22:37.640,WATSON: Ta.
01:22:39.600,01:22:42.280,"-So, nine million."
01:22:42.320,01:22:46.240,For Jade pin dragon den black tramway.
01:22:46.280,01:22:48.400,-An instruction to all their London operatives.
01:22:48.440,01:22:50.920,A message.
01:22:50.960,01:22:52.880,"-What, a jade pin?"
01:22:52.920,01:22:55.680,"-Bring it to the Tramway, their London hideout."
01:22:58.280,01:23:00.280,-Apparently.
01:23:00.320,01:23:02.120,Depends who owned it.
01:23:08.400,01:23:10.400,SHERLOCK: Two operatives based in London.
01:23:10.440,01:23:13.080,They travel over to Dalian to smuggle those vases.
01:23:13.120,01:23:16.440,"One of them helps himself to something, a little hairpin."
01:23:16.480,01:23:18.440,WATSON: Worth nine million pounds.
01:23:18.480,01:23:20.960,"Eddie Van Coon was the thief, he stole the treasure when he was in China."
01:23:21.000,01:23:22.680,"How do you know it was Van Coon, not Lukis?"
01:23:22.720,01:23:25.400,-Even the killer didn't know that.
01:23:38.160,01:23:40.400,-Amanda?
01:23:40.440,01:23:41.960,"Oh, hello."
01:23:42.000,01:23:44.680,A little gift when he came back from China.
01:23:44.720,01:23:49.120,-How do you know that?
01:23:49.160,01:23:51.040,-Someone's been gossiping.
01:23:51.080,01:23:52.520,Then I don't understand why...
01:23:52.560,01:23:56.480,"Scented hand soap in his apartment, 300 millilitres of it."
01:23:56.520,01:23:57.640,Bottle almost finished.
01:23:58.360,01:24:00.120,Sorry?
01:24:00.160,01:24:04.480,"I don't think Eddie Van Coon was the type of chap to buy himself hand soap, not unless he had a lady coming over."
01:24:04.520,01:24:07.240,And it's the same brand as that hand cream there on your desk.
01:24:09.800,01:24:13.280,"Look, it wasn't serious between us."
01:24:13.320,01:24:16.480,"It was over in a flash, it couldn't last."
01:24:16.520,01:24:20.160,-He was my boss.
01:24:22.840,01:24:25.600,I thought he didn't appreciate me.
01:24:25.640,01:24:27.400,Took me for granted.
01:24:28.880,01:24:30.720,Stood me up once too often.
01:24:30.760,01:24:34.560,"We'd plan to go away for the weekend, and then he'd just leave."
01:24:34.600,01:24:36.880,Fly off to China at a moment's notice.
01:24:36.920,01:24:39.240,And he brought you a present from abroad to say sorry.
01:24:40.960,01:24:43.400,Can I just have a look at it?
01:24:50.080,01:24:52.840,He really climbed up onto the balcony?
01:24:52.880,01:24:55.920,Nail a plank across the window and all your problems are over.
01:24:58.600,01:25:00.880,Thanks.
01:25:00.920,01:25:03.040,He said he bought it in a street market.
01:25:03.080,01:25:05.160,"Oh, I don't think that's true."
01:25:06.440,01:25:07.960,"Yeah, that's Eddie."
01:25:08.000,01:25:10.360,"Didn't know its value, just thought it would suit you."
01:25:10.400,01:25:11.440,Oh?
01:25:12.280,01:25:13.320,What's it worth?
01:25:15.080,01:25:17.520,Nine million pounds.
01:25:20.800,01:25:23.360,"-Oh, my God."
01:25:40.320,01:25:44.320,"WATSON: Over a thousand years old, and it's sitting on her bedside table every night."
01:25:44.360,01:25:47.040,He didn't know its value.
01:25:48.880,01:25:51.160,Should've just got her a lucky cat.
01:25:51.560,01:25:52.640,Mmm.
01:25:54.880,01:25:57.200,"-You mind, don't you?"
01:25:58.280,01:26:00.640,That she escaped.
01:26:00.680,01:26:02.720,It's not enough that we got her two henchmen.
01:26:02.760,01:26:04.480,"Must be a vast network, John."
01:26:04.520,01:26:06.480,Thousands of operatives.
01:26:06.520,01:26:08.880,"You and I, we barely scratched the surface."
01:26:08.920,01:26:10.920,"You cracked the code though, Sherlock."
01:26:10.960,01:26:13.800,And maybe Dimmock can track down all of them now that he knows it.
01:26:13.840,01:26:15.400,No.
01:26:15.440,01:26:21.880,"No. I crack this code, all the smugglers have to do is pick up another book."
01:26:47.560,01:26:56.520,"Without you, without your assistance, we would not have found passage into London."
01:26:59.800,01:27:01.520,You have my thanks.
01:27:13.280,01:27:15.120,We did not anticipate.
01:27:16.960,01:27:19.440,We did not know this man would come.
01:27:21.640,01:27:23.760,This Sherlock Holmes.
01:27:27.760,01:27:30.960,And now your safety is compromised.
01:27:41.000,01:27:43.280,I will not reveal your identity.
00:00:15.280,00:00:18.640,Just tell me what happened from the beginning.
00:00:19.880,00:00:21.920,We had been to a bar.
00:00:21.960,00:00:30.120,"Nice place, and, uh, I got chatting with one of the waitresses, and Karen weren't happy with that, so..."
00:00:30.160,00:00:32.800,"When we get back to the hotel, we end up having a bit of a ding-dong, don't we?"
00:00:35.960,00:00:40.160,"She's always getting at me, saying I weren't a real man."
00:00:40.200,00:00:42.320,Wasn't a real man.
00:00:42.360,00:00:44.960,-What?
00:00:46.640,00:00:47.680,Oh.
00:00:49.560,00:00:50.640,Go on.
00:00:52.440,00:00:58.360,"Well... Then I don't know how it happened, but suddenly there's a knife in my hands..."
00:01:00.160,00:01:04.080,"And me old man was a butcher, so I know how to handle knives."
00:01:04.120,00:01:06.480,-He learned us how to cut up a beast.
00:01:06.520,00:01:08.720,-What?
00:01:09.880,00:01:11.560,"-Yeah, well, then I done it."
00:01:11.600,00:01:17.360,"Did it! Stabbed her, over and over and over, and I looked down, and she weren't..."
00:01:19.160,00:01:22.600,Wasn't moving no more.
00:01:24.360,00:01:25.640,Any more.
00:01:29.080,00:01:33.840,"God help me, I don't know how it happened, but it was an accident, I swear."
00:01:33.880,00:01:36.280,"Hey. You've got to help me, Mr Holmes!"
00:01:37.240,00:01:38.920,Everyone says you're the best.
00:01:38.960,00:01:41.040,Without you...
00:01:41.080,00:01:43.040,I'll get hung for this.
00:01:43.080,00:01:45.120,"No, no, Mr Bewick, not at all."
00:01:46.680,00:01:48.560,"Hanged, yes."
00:02:51.520,00:02:54.000,What the hell are you doing?
00:02:54.040,00:02:55.480,-Bored.
00:02:55.520,00:02:57.240,-Bored!
00:02:57.280,00:02:58.720,Bored!
00:02:59.280,00:03:00.600,Bored!
00:03:02.120,00:03:04.160,Don't know what's got into the criminal classes.
00:03:05.240,00:03:07.200,Good job I'm not one of them.
00:03:07.240,00:03:08.480,So you take it out on the wall?
00:03:08.520,00:03:10.480,"Oh, the wall had it coming."
00:03:15.040,00:03:16.800,What about that Russian case?
00:03:16.840,00:03:19.400,Belarus.
00:03:19.440,00:03:20.720,Not worth my time.
00:03:20.760,00:03:22.080,"Oh, shame."
00:03:26.120,00:03:27.600,Anything in? I'm starving.
00:03:29.280,00:03:30.600,Oh...
00:03:38.720,00:03:40.240,It's a head.
00:03:41.600,00:03:43.560,-A severed head!
00:03:43.600,00:03:45.440,"-No, there's a head in the fridge."
00:03:45.480,00:03:47.320,A bloody head!
00:03:47.360,00:03:49.400,"Well, where else was I supposed to I put it?"
00:03:49.440,00:03:52.480,-Well...
00:03:52.520,00:03:56.240,I'm measuring the coagulation of saliva after death.
00:03:56.280,00:03:58.320,I see you've written up the taxi driver case.
00:03:58.360,00:03:59.640,Uh... Yes.
00:04:00.840,00:04:03.800,A Study in Pink. Nice.
00:04:03.840,00:04:06.680,"Well, you know."
00:04:06.720,00:04:07.760,There was a lot of pink.
00:04:08.480,00:04:09.880,Did you like it?
00:04:09.920,00:04:11.600,Um... No.
00:04:11.640,00:04:13.560,Why not?
00:04:13.600,00:04:15.080,Flattered?
00:04:15.120,00:04:16.880,Sherlock sees through everything and everyone in seconds.
00:04:16.920,00:04:21.720,"What's incredible, though, is how spectacularly ignorant he is -about some things."
00:04:21.760,00:04:24.160,"Oh, you meant spectacularly ignorant in a nice way."
00:04:24.200,00:04:29.040,"Look, it doesn't matter to me -who's Prime Minister or who's sleeping with who."
00:04:29.080,00:04:30.240,Whether the Earth goes round the sun.
00:04:30.280,00:04:32.160,"Oh, God, that again."
00:04:32.200,00:04:33.680,Not important...
00:04:33.720,00:04:37.360,It's primary school stuff.
00:04:37.400,00:04:38.720,"Well, if I ever did, I've deleted it."
00:04:38.760,00:04:40.880,Deleted it?
00:04:40.920,00:04:49.000,"Listen. This is my hard drive, and it only makes sense to put things in there that are useful."
00:04:49.040,00:04:51.760,Ordinary people fill their heads with all kinds of rubbish.
00:04:51.800,00:04:54.360,That makes it hard to get at the stuff that matters.
00:04:55.680,00:04:57.840,-But it's the solar system!
00:04:57.880,00:04:59.720,"Oh, hell!"
00:04:59.760,00:05:01.920,So we go around the sun.
00:04:59.760,00:05:05.560,"If we went around the moon or round and round the garden like a teddy bear, it wouldn't make any difference."
00:05:05.600,00:05:07.880,All that matters to me is the work!
00:05:09.080,00:05:11.040,"Without that, my brain rots!"
00:05:11.080,00:05:12.760,Put that in your blog.
00:05:12.800,00:05:15.000,"Or better still, stop inflicting your opinions on the world."
00:05:26.840,00:05:28.560,-Excuse me.
00:05:26.840,00:05:32.880,-MRS HUDSON: Ooh-ooh!
00:05:33.960,00:05:35.840,Have you two had a little domestic?
00:05:43.480,00:05:45.840,"-Ooh, it's a bit nippy out there."
00:05:45.880,00:05:47.680,He should have wrapped himself up a bit more.
00:05:52.480,00:05:54.480,"Look at that, Mrs Hudson."
00:05:56.000,00:05:57.160,Quiet.
00:06:01.400,00:06:03.200,Isn't it hateful?
00:06:03.240,00:06:06.160,"Oh, I'm sure something will turn up, Sherlock."
00:06:06.200,00:06:09.200,A nice murder.
00:06:09.240,00:06:11.120,Mmm. Can't come too soon.
00:06:11.160,00:06:14.160,"Hey, what have you done to my bloody wall?"
00:06:15.640,00:06:17.880,"I'm putting this on your rent, young man!"
00:06:29.280,00:06:31.720,-Morning.
00:06:31.760,00:06:33.480,See? I told you you should've gone with the lilo.
00:06:33.520,00:06:37.240,"No, no, no, it's fine, I slept fine."
00:06:40.720,00:06:43.720,"Well, maybe next time I'll let you kip at the end of my bed, you know."
00:06:45.680,00:06:48.760,What about the time after that?
00:06:48.800,00:06:52.880,MALE REPORTER: Experts are hailing it as the artistic find of the century...
00:06:52.920,00:06:54.920,"-Say, do you want some breakfast?"
00:06:54.960,00:06:57.080,"Yeah, well, you better make it yourself, 'cause I'm gonna have a shower."
00:06:57.120,00:06:59.880,MALE REPORTER: It fetched over £20 million.
00:06:59.920,00:07:02.920,This one is anticipated to do even better.
00:07:02.960,00:07:05.440,Back now to our main story.
00:07:05.480,00:07:08.720,There's been a massive explosion in central London.
00:07:08.760,00:07:15.160,"As yet, there are no reports of any casualties and the police are unable to say if there's any suspicion of terrorist involvement."
00:07:16.200,00:07:18.160,Sarah!
00:07:18.200,00:07:19.240,The police have issued an emergency number for friends and relatives.
00:07:19.280,00:07:20.640,Sarah!
00:07:20.680,00:07:22.080,"Sorry, I've got to run!"
00:07:26.800,00:07:29.680,"Excuse me, can I get through?"
00:07:39.000,00:07:40.320,I live over there.
00:07:44.920,00:07:46.680,Sherlock!
00:07:46.720,00:07:48.120,Sherlock!
00:07:52.840,00:07:55.000,-John.
00:07:55.040,00:07:57.160,I saw it on the telly.
00:07:57.200,00:07:58.960,"Me? What? Oh, yeah, fine."
00:07:59.000,00:08:01.200,"Gas leak, apparently."
00:08:01.240,00:08:02.680,-I can't.
00:08:02.720,00:08:04.160,Can't?
00:08:04.200,00:08:06.480,Stuff I've got on is just too big.
00:08:06.520,00:08:10.440,Never mind your usual trivia.
00:08:11.760,00:08:14.960,-How's the diet?
00:08:15.000,00:08:16.760,"Perhaps you can get through to him, John."
00:08:16.800,00:08:20.480,-What?
00:08:20.520,00:08:22.000,"If you're so keen, why don't you investigate it?"
00:08:22.040,00:08:23.600,"No, no, no, no."
00:08:23.640,00:08:25.480,I can't possibly be away from the office for any length of time.
00:08:25.520,00:08:26.680,Not with the Korean elections so...
00:08:28.560,00:08:31.560,"Well, you don't need to know about that, do you?"
00:08:31.600,00:08:33.000,"Besides, a case like this, it requires..."
00:08:35.200,00:08:36.480,-Legwork.
00:08:37.880,00:08:39.760,"SHERLOCK: How's Sarah, John?"
00:08:39.800,00:08:42.680,"Sofa, Sherlock."
00:08:42.720,00:08:43.840,"Oh, yes, of course."
00:08:44.640,00:08:46.960,"How... Oh, never mind."
00:08:47.000,00:08:50.080,Sherlock's business seems to be booming since you and he became...
00:08:50.800,00:08:52.200,Pals.
00:08:52.240,00:08:54.160,What's he like to live with?
00:08:54.200,00:08:55.560,I'm never bored.
00:08:55.600,00:08:57.320,"Good. That's good, isn't it?"
00:09:06.360,00:09:10.240,"Andrew West, known as Westie to his friends. Civil servant."
00:09:10.280,00:09:15.400,Found dead on the tracks at Battersea Station this morning with his head smashed in.
00:09:15.440,00:09:16.880,JOHN: Jumped in front of a train?
00:09:16.920,00:09:19.040,MYCROFT: Seems the logical assumption.
00:09:20.480,00:09:22.720,-But?
00:09:22.760,00:09:25.120,"Well, you wouldn't be here if it was just an accident."
00:09:26.480,00:09:29.040,The MOD is working on a new missile defense system.
00:09:29.080,00:09:31.560,The Bruce-Partington program it's called.
00:09:31.600,00:09:33.200,The plans for it were on a memory stick.
00:09:33.240,00:09:35.160,That wasn't very clever.
00:09:36.600,00:09:38.320,-It's not the only copy.
00:09:38.360,00:09:41.200,But it is secret.
00:09:41.240,00:09:43.680,-Top secret?
00:09:43.720,00:09:45.800,We think West must have taken the memory stick.
00:09:45.840,00:09:48.200,We can't risk it falling into the wrong hands.
00:09:48.240,00:09:50.680,"You've got to find those plans, Sherlock."
00:09:51.600,00:09:53.000,Don't make me order you.
00:09:54.600,00:09:55.920,I'd like to see you try.
00:09:56.920,00:09:58.400,Think it over.
00:09:59.960,00:10:01.440,"-Goodbye, John."
00:10:02.760,00:10:04.000,See you very soon.
00:10:19.880,00:10:22.160,-Why did you lie?
00:10:22.200,00:10:24.760,You've got nothing on.
00:10:24.800,00:10:26.280,That's why the wall took a pounding.
00:10:26.320,00:10:27.880,Why did you tell your brother you were busy?
00:10:28.560,00:10:29.560,Why shouldn't I?
00:10:30.520,00:10:31.560,Oh.
00:10:32.360,00:10:33.480,Nice.
00:10:35.040,00:10:37.400,Sibling rivalry.
00:10:44.000,00:10:45.600,Sherlock Holmes.
00:10:48.560,00:10:51.160,Of course. How could I refuse?
00:10:51.200,00:10:53.920,Lestrade. I've been summoned.
00:10:53.960,00:10:56.200,-If you want me to.
00:10:58.120,00:10:59.880,I'd be lost without my blogger.
00:11:17.800,00:11:19.400,"LESTRADE: You like the funny cases, don't you?"
00:11:19.440,00:11:21.920,-The surprising ones.
00:11:21.960,00:11:23.960,You'll love this.
00:11:24.000,00:11:26.200,-That explosion.
00:11:26.240,00:11:27.480,-No.
00:11:27.520,00:11:29.360,-No. Made to look like one.
00:11:29.400,00:11:32.400,"Hardly anything left of the place, except a strongbox."
00:11:32.440,00:11:34.920,"A very strong box, and inside it was this."
00:11:34.960,00:11:36.480,You haven't opened it?
00:11:36.520,00:11:37.760,"It's addressed to you, isn't it?"
00:11:37.800,00:11:39.480,We've X-rayed it.
00:11:39.520,00:11:40.800,How reassuring.
00:11:51.000,00:11:52.520,Nice stationery.
00:11:53.800,00:11:55.280,-Bohemian.
00:11:56.520,00:11:57.760,From the Czech Republic.
00:11:57.800,00:11:59.040,-No fingerprints?
00:12:01.080,00:12:04.160,She used a fountain pen.
00:12:04.200,00:12:06.120,She?
00:12:06.160,00:12:07.240,Obviously.
00:12:23.160,00:12:26.160,But that... That's the phone.
00:12:26.200,00:12:27.800,"What, from The Study in Pink?"
00:12:31.040,00:12:33.120,A Study in Pink?
00:12:33.160,00:12:35.120,Of course. We all do.
00:12:35.160,00:12:37.520,Do you really not know that the Earth goes round the sun?
00:12:41.240,00:12:43.200,It isn't the same phone.
00:12:44.000,00:12:45.760,This one's brand-new.
00:12:45.800,00:12:48.160,Someone's gone to a lot of trouble to make it look like the same phone.
00:12:48.200,00:12:51.800,"Which means, your blog has a far wider readership."
00:12:53.240,00:12:55.760,AUTOMATED VOICE: You have one new message.
00:13:01.880,00:13:03.800,-Was that it?
00:13:08.760,00:13:10.800,LESTRADE: What the hell are we supposed to make of that?
00:13:10.840,00:13:14.960,An estate agent's photo and the bloody Greenwich pips.
00:13:15.000,00:13:16.800,-It's a warning.
00:13:18.440,00:13:24.760,"Some secret societies used to send dried melon seeds, orange pips, things like that."
00:13:26.440,00:13:29.360,They're warning us it's going to happen again.
00:13:29.400,00:13:31.520,-I've seen this place before.
00:13:31.560,00:13:33.440,-What's going to happen again?
00:13:55.000,00:13:56.360,Mrs Hudson!
00:14:00.080,00:14:03.240,"You had a look, didn't you, Sherlock, when you first came to see about your flat?"
00:14:03.280,00:14:04.960,"The door's been opened, recently."
00:14:05.000,00:14:06.760,"No, can't be."
00:14:08.360,00:14:10.600,I can't get anyone interested in this flat.
00:14:10.640,00:14:13.360,"It's the damp, I expect."
00:14:13.400,00:14:15.760,I'd a place once when I was first married.
00:14:15.800,00:14:17.760,Black mould all up the wall...
00:14:37.800,00:14:38.960,Shoes.
00:14:41.680,00:14:43.640,"He's a bomber, remember."
00:15:12.840,00:15:16.720,H... Hello...sexy.
00:15:18.440,00:15:20.440,-Who's this?
00:15:20.480,00:15:25.320,I've...sent you...
00:15:20.480,00:15:28.240,"A little puzzle, just to say hi."
00:15:35.240,00:15:37.760,I... I'm not crying.
00:15:38.560,00:15:39.960,I'm typing.
00:15:41.600,00:15:49.280,And this stupid bitch is reading it out.
00:15:51.840,00:15:53.640,The curtain rises.
00:15:54.760,00:15:56.480,-What?
00:15:56.520,00:15:57.720,"No, what did you mean?"
00:15:57.760,00:15:59.600,I've been expecting this for some time.
00:16:00.920,00:16:07.760,"Twelve hours to solve my puzzle, Sherlock..."
00:16:08.800,00:16:16.800,...or I'm going to be so...naughty.
00:16:51.800,00:16:53.360,"-JOHN: So, who do you suppose it was?"
00:16:54.640,00:16:56.320,"Woman on the phone, the crying woman."
00:16:56.360,00:16:59.760,"Oh, she doesn't matter, she's just a hostage."
00:16:59.800,00:17:01.840,"For God's sake, I wasn't thinking about leads."
00:17:01.880,00:17:03.240,You're not going to be much use to her.
00:17:05.880,00:17:08.400,"JOHN: Are they trying to trace it, trace the call?"
00:17:08.440,00:17:10.720,-One was too smart for that.
00:17:11.760,00:17:13.360,-Where is it?
00:17:23.000,00:17:24.080,Careful!
00:17:29.800,00:17:32.080,-Text from your brother.
00:17:32.120,00:17:34.000,Delete it?
00:17:34.040,00:17:35.960,Missile plans are out of the country now.
00:17:36.000,00:17:39.280,"Well, Mycroft thinks there is."
00:17:39.320,00:17:41.320,Then why didn't he cancel his dental appointment?
00:17:41.360,00:17:43.800,-His what?
00:17:43.840,00:17:47.680,"Look, Andrew West stole the missile plans, tried to sell them, got his head smashed in for his pains."
00:17:47.720,00:17:49.120,End of story.
00:17:49.160,00:17:50.400,The only mystery is this.
00:17:50.440,00:17:53.840,Why is my bother so determined to bore me when somebody else is being so delightfully interesting?
00:17:53.880,00:17:55.840,Try and remember there's a woman who might die.
00:17:55.880,00:17:57.720,What for?
00:17:57.760,00:17:59.720,"There's hospitals full of people dying, Doctor."
00:17:59.760,00:18:02.400,Why don't you go cry by their bedside?
00:18:04.240,00:18:05.640,-Ah!
00:18:07.080,00:18:08.800,-Any luck?
00:18:10.800,00:18:12.320,"Oh, sorry. I didn't..."
00:18:12.360,00:18:14.760,"Jim, hi! Come in! Come in!"
00:18:16.200,00:18:19.640,"Jim, this is Sherlock Holmes."
00:18:19.680,00:18:21.600,-JIM: Ah!
00:18:22.600,00:18:24.920,-Sorry.
00:18:26.080,00:18:29.160,Hi. So you're Sherlock Holmes.
00:18:29.200,00:18:32.280,Molly's told me all about you.
00:18:33.360,00:18:35.320,"Jim works in IT, upstairs."
00:18:35.360,00:18:37.560,That's how we met.
00:18:39.240,00:18:40.680,-Gay.
00:18:41.360,00:18:43.280,"Nothing. Um, hey."
00:18:43.320,00:18:44.720,-Hi.
00:18:44.760,00:18:46.200,Sorry. Sorry!
00:18:48.920,00:18:50.960,"Well, I'd better be off."
00:18:51.000,00:18:53.520,-I'll see you at the Fox.
00:18:54.080,00:18:55.320,-Bye.
00:18:55.360,00:18:56.600,It was nice to meet you.
00:18:58.640,00:18:59.880,You too.
00:19:07.840,00:19:11.160,"-What do you mean, gay?"
00:19:11.200,00:19:12.760,"And domestic bliss must suit you, Molly."
00:19:12.800,00:19:14.720,You've put on three pounds since I last saw you.
00:19:14.760,00:19:16.320,-Two and a half.
00:19:16.360,00:19:18.640,-JOHN: Sherlock.
00:19:18.680,00:19:20.600,Why do you have to spoil...
00:19:20.640,00:19:22.480,With that level of personal grooming?
00:19:22.520,00:19:25.320,Because he puts product in his hair?
00:19:25.360,00:19:26.800,"You wash your hair, there's a difference."
00:19:26.840,00:19:28.320,"No, no."
00:19:28.360,00:19:33.240,"Clear signs of taurine cream around the frown lines, those tired, clubber's eyes."
00:19:33.280,00:19:35.320,-His underwear?
00:19:35.360,00:19:37.320,"Very visible, very particular brand."
00:19:37.360,00:19:41.040,"That, plus the suggestive fact that he just left his number under this dish here."
00:19:41.080,00:19:44.040,And I'd say you'd better break it off now and save yourself the pain.
00:19:49.000,00:19:50.200,"-Charming, well done."
00:19:50.240,00:19:52.440,Just saving her time.
00:19:59.440,00:20:01.240,"-Go on, then."
00:20:02.520,00:20:04.160,You know what I do.
00:20:04.200,00:20:05.880,-Go on.
00:20:05.920,00:20:08.120,I'm not going to stand here so you can humiliate me while I try and...
00:20:08.160,00:20:10.760,"An outside eye, a second opinion."
00:20:10.800,00:20:12.600,"-Yeah, right."
00:20:17.080,00:20:18.680,-Fine.
00:20:23.080,00:20:25.560,"-Oh, they're just a pair of shoes... Trainers."
00:20:27.360,00:20:28.480,Um...
00:20:30.880,00:20:34.000,They're in good nick.
00:20:30.880,00:20:38.920,"I'd say they were pretty new, except the sole has been well-worn, so the owner must have had them for a while."
00:20:38.960,00:20:41.840,"Uh, very '80s."
00:20:41.880,00:20:44.040,You're on sparkling form.
00:20:45.520,00:20:48.040,They're quite big. A man's.
00:20:48.360,00:20:49.520,But...
00:20:51.320,00:20:53.960,But there's traces of a name inside in felt-tip.
00:20:55.640,00:20:59.800,"And adults don't write their names inside their shoes, so these belong to a kid."
00:20:59.840,00:21:01.120,Excellent. What else?
00:21:02.280,00:21:03.400,Uh...
00:21:04.600,00:21:05.920,-That's it.
00:21:07.000,00:21:08.320,-How did I do?
00:21:08.800,00:21:10.880,Really well.
00:21:10.920,00:21:13.840,"I mean, you missed almost everything of importance, but, you know..."
00:21:16.200,00:21:17.800,The owner loved these.
00:21:17.840,00:21:19.360,Whitened where they got discoloured.
00:21:19.400,00:21:22.000,"Changed the laces three... No, four times."
00:21:22.040,00:21:26.800,"Even so, there are traces of his flaky skin where his fingers have come into contact with them so he suffered from eczema."
00:21:26.840,00:21:30.560,"The shoes are well-worn more so on the inner side, which means the owner had weak arches."
00:21:30.600,00:21:33.320,"-British-made, 20 years old."
00:21:33.360,00:21:34.760,"They're not retro, they're original."
00:21:34.800,00:21:37.240,"Limited edition, two blue stripes, 1989."
00:21:37.280,00:21:40.040,But there's still mud on them.
00:21:40.080,00:21:42.000,Someone's kept them that way.
00:21:43.480,00:21:45.320,Quite a bit of mud caked on the soles.
00:21:45.360,00:21:47.800,Analysis shows it's from Sussex with London mud overlaying it.
00:21:47.840,00:21:49.240,-How do you know?
00:21:49.280,00:21:51.760,"Clear as a map reference to me. South of the river, too."
00:21:51.800,00:21:55.640,"So the kid wore these trainers, came to London from Sussex, 20 years ago and left them behind."
00:21:55.680,00:21:59.000,-So what happened to him?
00:21:59.040,00:22:01.320,"I mean, he loved those shoes, remember. He'd never leave them filthy."
00:22:01.360,00:22:03.800,Wouldn't let them go unless he had to.
00:22:03.840,00:22:06.280,"So, a child with big feet gets..."
00:22:09.440,00:22:10.480,Oh!
00:22:12.240,00:22:14.920,-What?
00:22:14.960,00:22:15.960,"Sorry, who?"
00:22:16.920,00:22:19.520,"Carl Powers, John."
00:22:21.200,00:22:23.000,What is it?
00:22:23.040,00:22:24.760,It's where I began.
00:22:28.240,00:22:33.880,"1989, young kid, champion swimmer, came up from Brighton for a school sports tournament, drowned in the pool."
00:22:33.920,00:22:36.320,Tragic accident.
00:22:36.360,00:22:37.760,-But you remember.
00:22:37.800,00:22:39.800,-Something fishy about it?
00:22:40.600,00:22:43.000,Nobody except me.
00:22:43.040,00:22:45.160,I was only a kid myself.
00:22:45.200,00:22:46.680,"You started young, didn't you?"
00:22:46.720,00:22:52.920,"The boy, Carl Powers, had some kind of fit in the water, but by the time they got him out, it was too late."
00:22:52.960,00:22:55.400,There was something wrong somewhere. I couldn't get it out of my head.
00:22:55.440,00:22:56.760,-What?
00:22:56.800,00:22:58.680,-What about them?
00:22:58.720,00:23:00.480,I made a fuss.
00:22:58.720,00:23:03.640,I tried to get the police interested but nobody seemed to think it was important.
00:23:03.680,00:23:06.200,He'd left all the rest of his clothes in the locker.
00:23:06.240,00:23:07.840,But there was no sign of his shoes.
00:23:10.840,00:23:12.160,Until now.
00:23:44.240,00:23:46.880,Can I help?
00:23:46.920,00:23:49.360,-I want to help.
00:23:52.440,00:23:53.880,It's your brother.
00:23:53.920,00:23:56.680,He's texting me now.
00:23:56.720,00:23:59.280,-How does he know my number?
00:24:00.720,00:24:03.800,"Look, he did say..."
00:24:03.840,00:24:05.920,Hmph! How quaint!
00:24:05.960,00:24:07.640,-What is?
00:24:08.520,00:24:09.840,Queen and country.
00:24:09.880,00:24:12.920,-You can't just ignore it.
00:24:12.960,00:24:15.280,Putting my best man onto it right now.
00:24:16.120,00:24:17.680,"Right, good!"
00:24:18.880,00:24:19.960,Who's that?
00:24:21.880,00:24:25.080,John! How nice.
00:24:25.120,00:24:26.440,How can I help you?
00:24:27.240,00:24:28.360,Thank you. Um...
00:24:29.320,00:24:31.400,I was wanting to...
00:24:31.440,00:24:37.240,"Your brother sent me to collect more facts about the stolen plans, the missile plans."
00:24:38.800,00:24:40.000,-Did he?
00:24:41.440,00:24:43.960,He's investigating now.
00:24:45.640,00:24:47.480,Investigating away.
00:24:47.520,00:24:49.680,"Um, I just wondered what else you could tell me about the dead man."
00:24:51.200,00:24:54.480,"Um, 27."
00:24:54.840,00:24:56.760,MI6.
00:24:56.800,00:25:00.040,He was involved in the Bruce-Partington program in a minor capacity.
00:25:00.080,00:25:02.040,Security checks A-OK.
00:25:02.080,00:25:05.280,No known terrorist affiliations or sympathies.
00:25:05.320,00:25:07.880,Last seen by his fiancee at 10.30 yesterday evening.
00:25:09.600,00:25:11.000,"Lucy, love, I've got to go out."
00:25:12.440,00:25:14.080,I've got to see someone.
00:25:15.360,00:25:16.760,-Westie!
00:25:16.800,00:25:18.160,JOHN: Right.
00:25:18.200,00:25:21.160,"He was found at Battersea, yes."
00:25:22.000,00:25:23.320,-No.
00:25:24.000,00:25:29.680,"He had an Oyster card, but it hadn't been used."
00:25:29.720,00:25:32.360,-He must have bought a ticket.
00:25:32.400,00:25:34.000,There was no ticket on the body.
00:25:34.040,00:25:35.960,Then...
00:25:36.000,00:25:38.000,Then how did he end up with a bashed in brain on the tracks of Battersea?
00:25:38.040,00:25:39.760,That is the question.
00:25:39.800,00:25:43.160,The one I was rather hoping Sherlock would provide an answer to.
00:25:43.200,00:25:44.600,How's he getting on?
00:25:45.400,00:25:47.240,He's fine.
00:25:47.280,00:25:50.600,And it is going...very well.
00:25:50.640,00:25:52.920,"He's, um..."
00:26:06.120,00:26:08.000,-Poison!
00:26:08.040,00:26:10.200,Clostridium botulinum.
00:26:10.240,00:26:12.360,It's one of the deadliest poisons on the planet.
00:26:13.520,00:26:15.520,Carl Powers.
00:26:15.560,00:26:18.280,"Oh, wait."
00:26:18.320,00:26:20.800,-Remember the shoelaces?
00:26:20.840,00:26:23.000,The boy suffered from eczema.
00:26:23.040,00:26:25.320,It'd be the easiest thing in the world to introduce the poison into his medication.
00:26:25.360,00:26:30.120,"Two hours later, he comes up to London, the poison takes effect, paralyses the muscles and he drowns."
00:26:30.160,00:26:32.120,But how come the autopsy didn't pick that up?
00:26:32.160,00:26:34.480,It's virtually undetectable.
00:26:36.600,00:26:41.800,There are still tiny traces of it left inside the trainers from where he'd put the cream on his feet.
00:26:43.640,00:26:45.200,That's why they had to go.
00:26:45.240,00:26:46.640,-So how do we let the bomber know?
00:26:46.680,00:26:49.280,-Mmm-hmm.
00:26:49.320,00:26:51.920,-The killer kept the shoes all these years.
00:26:53.880,00:26:55.880,-Meaning...
00:27:03.000,00:27:05.320,"Well done, you."
00:27:06.960,00:27:09.240,Come and get me.
00:27:10.760,00:27:12.400,Where are you?
00:27:12.440,00:27:13.880,Tell us where you are.
00:27:21.800,00:27:23.720,LESTRADE: She lives in Cornwall.
00:27:23.760,00:27:30.360,"Two men broke in wearing masks, forced her to drive to the car park and decked her out in enough explosives to take down a house."
00:27:31.360,00:27:33.240,Told her to phone you.
00:27:33.280,00:27:36.360,Check the read-out from this pager.
00:27:36.400,00:27:39.520,"Well, if she deviated by one word, the sniper would set her off."
00:27:39.560,00:27:41.280,Or if you hadn't solved the case.
00:27:45.280,00:27:46.640,Elegant?
00:27:46.680,00:27:49.120,What was the point?
00:27:49.160,00:27:52.720,"No, I can't be the only person in the world that gets bored."
00:28:00.000,00:28:02.240,AUTOMATED VOICE: You have one new message.
00:28:07.120,00:28:08.480,Four pips.
00:28:08.520,00:28:10.600,"First test passed, it would seem."
00:28:10.640,00:28:12.320,Here's the second.
00:28:15.840,00:28:17.320,"It's abandoned, wouldn't you say?"
00:28:17.360,00:28:19.240,I'll see if it's been reported.
00:28:19.280,00:28:21.520,"Freak, it's for you."
00:28:26.440,00:28:29.120,Hello.
00:28:29.160,00:28:31.360,that you've gone to the police.
00:28:31.880,00:28:33.720,Who is this?
00:28:33.760,00:28:35.800,Is this you again?
00:28:35.840,00:28:37.560,MAN: But don't rely on them.
00:28:39.480,00:28:43.640,"Clever you, guessing about Carl Powers."
00:28:45.080,00:28:46.800,I never liked him.
00:28:50.360,00:28:54.600,"Carl laughed at me, so I stopped him laughing."
00:28:56.440,00:28:58.600,"You've stolen another voice, I presume."
00:29:00.000,00:29:02.080,This is about you and me.
00:29:04.520,00:29:06.840,Who are you?
00:29:06.880,00:29:07.880,What's that noise?
00:29:10.760,00:29:12.960,"It's the sounds of life, Sherlock."
00:29:16.160,00:29:19.640,But don't worry.
00:29:23.400,00:29:26.040,You solved my last puzzle in nine hours.
00:29:28.600,00:29:30.160,This time you have eight.
00:29:33.480,00:29:34.760,Great!
00:29:35.840,00:29:37.200,We've found it.
00:29:53.240,00:29:56.960,The car was hired yesterday morning by an Ian Monkford.
00:29:57.000,00:29:59.960,Banker of some kind.
00:30:00.000,00:30:03.080,"Told his wife he was going away on a business trip, and he never arrived."
00:30:03.120,00:30:04.320,DONOVAN: You're still hanging round him.
00:30:05.040,00:30:06.280,"Yeah, well..."
00:30:06.320,00:30:08.200,"-Opposites attract, I suppose."
00:30:08.240,00:30:11.640,"You should get yourself a hobby. Stamps, maybe."
00:30:11.680,00:30:14.480,"Before you ask, yes, it's Monkford's blood."
00:30:17.280,00:30:19.480,-No body.
00:30:19.520,00:30:21.720,Get a sample sent to the lab.
00:30:24.160,00:30:25.320,Oh!
00:30:27.680,00:30:30.240,-Mrs Monkford?
00:30:30.280,00:30:32.360,"Sorry, but I've already spoken with two policemen."
00:30:32.400,00:30:34.240,"No, we're not from the police, we're..."
00:30:34.280,00:30:36.840,Very old friend of your husband's.
00:30:37.600,00:30:38.880,"We, um..."
00:30:40.240,00:30:41.440,We grew up together.
00:30:42.320,00:30:44.240,I'm sorry. Who?
00:30:44.280,00:30:45.920,I don't think he ever mentioned you.
00:30:45.960,00:30:48.520,"Oh, he must have done."
00:30:48.560,00:30:50.960,"This is horrible. I mean, I just can't believe it."
00:30:51.000,00:30:53.240,I only saw him the other day.
00:30:53.280,00:30:55.760,Same old Ian.
00:30:55.800,00:30:59.240,Sorry... My husband has been depressed for months.
00:31:00.760,00:31:02.240,Who are you?
00:31:02.280,00:31:06.080,Pretty strange that he hired a car.
00:31:06.120,00:31:08.080,Why would he do that?
00:31:08.120,00:31:11.320,"No, it isn't."
00:31:11.360,00:31:13.800,"Ah, well! That was Ian."
00:31:13.840,00:31:17.120,-That was Ian all over.
00:31:17.160,00:31:19.160,Wasn't it? Interesting.
00:31:21.360,00:31:22.920,-Who was that?
00:31:22.960,00:31:24.800,People don't like telling you things.
00:31:24.840,00:31:26.520,They love to contradict you.
00:31:26.560,00:31:28.080,"Past tense, did you notice?"
00:31:28.120,00:31:31.080,"-Sorry, what?"
00:31:31.120,00:31:33.800,She joined in.
00:31:33.840,00:31:35.280,You think she murdered her husband?
00:31:35.320,00:31:37.320,Definitely not.
00:31:39.800,00:31:41.520,SALLY: Fishing.
00:31:41.560,00:31:43.800,-Try fishing.
00:31:43.840,00:31:45.760,Janus Cars.
00:31:45.800,00:31:47.320,Just found this in the glove compartment.
00:31:57.360,00:31:59.200,"Can't see how I can help you, gentlemen."
00:31:59.240,00:32:01.840,Mr Monkford hired the car from you yesterday.
00:32:03.280,00:32:05.520,Mazda Rx8.
00:32:06.600,00:32:07.640,Is that one?
00:32:08.520,00:32:10.360,"No, they're all Jags."
00:32:10.400,00:32:12.880,"I can see you're not a car man, eh?"
00:32:12.920,00:32:15.360,But surely you can afford one.
00:32:15.400,00:32:16.760,"Yeah, that's a fair point."
00:32:16.800,00:32:18.760,You know how it is.
00:32:18.800,00:32:21.880,"Once you start picking at the licorice Allsorts, when does it all stop?"
00:32:21.920,00:32:24.760,-But you didn't know Mr Monkford.
00:32:24.800,00:32:27.040,He came in here and hired one of my cars.
00:32:27.080,00:32:29.080,I've no idea what happened to him.
00:32:29.120,00:32:30.720,"Nice holiday, Mr Ewart?"
00:32:30.760,00:32:32.560,-Eh?
00:32:32.600,00:32:35.120,"No, it's sun beds, I'm afraid."
00:32:35.800,00:32:37.200,Too busy to get away.
00:32:37.240,00:32:39.520,"My wife would love it, though, bit of sun."
00:32:39.560,00:32:41.360,Have you got any change for the cigarette machine?
00:32:41.400,00:32:42.760,-What?
00:32:41.400,00:32:44.440,"-Well, I noticed one on the way in, and I haven't got any change."
00:32:44.480,00:32:45.560,Um... Oh.
00:32:49.960,00:32:51.600,"No, sorry."
00:32:51.640,00:32:54.320,"Oh, well! Thank you very much for your time, Mr Ewart."
00:32:55.560,00:32:58.040,You've been very helpful.
00:32:59.920,00:33:01.080,I've got change if you still want to...
00:33:01.120,00:33:04.480,"Nicotine patches, remember?"
00:33:04.520,00:33:06.040,"So, what was all that about?"
00:33:06.080,00:33:08.040,I needed to look inside his wallet.
00:33:08.080,00:33:10.040,-Why?
00:33:43.960,00:33:46.080,Hello.
00:33:46.120,00:33:49.160,The clue's in the name.
00:33:51.320,00:33:52.880,Why would you be giving me a clue?
00:33:54.320,00:33:56.520,Why does anyone do anything?
00:33:58.560,00:34:00.920,Because I'm bored.
00:34:00.960,00:34:02.960,"We were made for each other, Sherlock."
00:34:04.400,00:34:05.920,Then talk to me in your own voice.
00:34:07.120,00:34:08.480,Patience.
00:34:29.600,00:34:31.800,"How much blood was on that seat, would you say?"
00:34:31.840,00:34:33.520,How much? About a pint.
00:34:33.560,00:34:36.640,Not about. Exactly a pint.
00:34:36.680,00:34:39.640,"The blood's definitely Ian Monkford's, but it's been frozen."
00:34:39.680,00:34:42.280,-Frozen?
00:34:42.320,00:34:46.640,I think Ian Monkford gave a pint of his blood some time ago and that's what they spread on the seats.
00:34:46.680,00:34:48.520,-Who did?
00:34:50.120,00:34:53.440,-The god with two faces?
00:34:53.480,00:34:54.880,They provide a very special service.
00:34:54.920,00:35:01.000,"If you've got any kind of a problem, money troubles, bad marriage, whatever, Janus Cars will help you disappear."
00:35:01.040,00:35:03.080,Ian Monkford was up to his eyes in some kind of trouble.
00:35:03.120,00:35:06.160,"Financial, at a guess."
00:35:06.200,00:35:11.120,"But if he were to vanish, if the car he hired was found abandoned with his blood all over the driver's seat..."
00:35:11.160,00:35:12.520,-So where is he?
00:35:13.120,00:35:14.600,Colombia?
00:35:14.640,00:35:18.480,"Mr Ewart, of Janus Cars, had a 20,000 Colombian peso note in his wallet."
00:35:19.480,00:35:20.760,"Quite a bit of change, too."
00:35:21.960,00:35:27.680,"He told us he hadn't been abroad recently, but when I asked him about the cars, I could see his tan line clearly."
00:35:27.720,00:35:29.360,No one wears a shirt on a sun bed.
00:35:29.400,00:35:31.160,"-That, plus his arm."
00:35:31.200,00:35:34.280,He kept scratching it.
00:35:34.320,00:35:38.360,"Why? Because he'd recently had a booster jab, HepB probably."
00:35:38.400,00:35:40.880,Conclusion?
00:35:38.400,00:35:42.320,He'd just come back from settling Ian Monkford into his new life in Colombia.
00:35:42.360,00:35:46.520,Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance and she splits it with Janus Cars.
00:35:46.560,00:35:49.440,-Mrs Monkford?
00:35:49.480,00:35:51.600,"Now go and arrest them, Inspector, that's what you do best."
00:35:51.640,00:35:53.960,We need to let our friendly bomber know that the case is solved.
00:35:55.800,00:35:57.240,I am on fire!
00:36:19.840,00:36:21.200,You can come and fetch me.
00:36:23.760,00:36:24.880,Help!
00:36:24.920,00:36:26.520,"Help me, please!"
00:36:42.640,00:36:44.760,-Feeling better?
00:36:44.800,00:36:47.480,We've hardly stopped for breath since this thing started.
00:36:49.840,00:36:51.560,-Has it occurred to you...
00:36:51.600,00:36:54.920,"No, has it occurred to you that the bomber's playing a game with you?"
00:36:54.960,00:36:59.120,"The envelope, breaking into the other flat, the dead kid's shoes, it's all meant for you."
00:36:59.160,00:37:00.320,"Yes, I know."
00:37:01.480,00:37:03.560,"Is it him, then? Moriarty?"
00:37:04.080,00:37:05.360,Perhaps.
00:37:13.000,00:37:15.680,-That could be anybody.
00:37:15.720,00:37:17.960,"Lucky for you, I've been more than a little unemployed."
00:37:18.000,00:37:19.720,How do you mean?
00:37:19.760,00:37:21.080,"Lucky for you, Mrs Hudson and I watch far too much telly."
00:37:29.240,00:37:32.000,"Thank you, Tyra! Doesn't she look lovely, everybody, now?"
00:37:33.800,00:37:36.760,"Anyway, speaking of silk purses..."
00:37:37.360,00:37:38.520,Hello?
00:37:38.560,00:37:39.760,This one...
00:37:40.840,00:37:42.360,...is a bit...
00:37:44.440,00:37:45.800,...defective.
00:37:46.560,00:37:47.760,Sorry.
00:37:53.800,00:37:55.040,This is...
00:37:56.760,00:37:58.680,A funny one.
00:38:01.080,00:38:02.720,I'll give you...
00:38:06.040,00:38:09.240,-12 hours.
00:38:12.680,00:38:14.600,Why are you doing this?
00:38:16.640,00:38:21.160,I like to watch you...
00:38:23.480,00:38:24.880,Dance.
00:38:32.920,00:38:36.600,CONNIE: And I see you're back to your bad habits.
00:38:36.640,00:38:41.480,MALE REPORTER: Continuing into the sudden death of the popular TV personality Connie Prince.
00:38:41.520,00:38:46.640,"Miss Prince, famous for her makeover programmes, was found dead two days ago by her brother in the house they shared..."
00:38:50.160,00:38:54.200,"Connie Prince, 54."
00:38:54.240,00:38:56.520,-Did you see it?
00:38:56.560,00:38:59.600,-Very popular.
00:38:59.640,00:39:02.480,Dead two days.
00:38:59.640,00:39:05.000,"According to one of her staff, Raoul de Santos, she cut her hand on a rusty nail in the garden."
00:39:05.040,00:39:06.440,Nasty wound.
00:39:06.480,00:39:08.520,Tetanus bacteria enters the bloodstream...
00:39:09.440,00:39:11.160,"Good night, Vienna."
00:39:11.200,00:39:12.920,I suppose.
00:39:12.960,00:39:16.120,-Something's wrong with this picture.
00:39:16.160,00:39:19.560,It can't be as simple as it seems otherwise the bomber wouldn't be directing us towards it.
00:39:20.280,00:39:21.480,Something's wrong.
00:39:43.200,00:39:44.400,-John?
00:39:46.040,00:39:48.680,"Cut on her hand, it's deep."
00:39:49.520,00:39:51.520,-Yeah.
00:39:52.560,00:39:54.400,"Very clean, and fresh."
00:39:57.960,00:40:00.040,How long would the bacteria have been incubating inside her?
00:40:01.080,00:40:03.120,"JOHN: Oh, eight, ten days."
00:40:05.320,00:40:07.920,The cut was made later.
00:40:07.960,00:40:10.560,-After she was dead?
00:40:10.600,00:40:14.320,"The only question is, how did the tetanus enter the dead woman's system?"
00:40:15.680,00:40:17.600,"-You want to help, right?"
00:40:17.640,00:40:20.120,"Connie Prince's background, family history, everything."
00:40:20.160,00:40:21.320,Right.
00:40:24.200,00:40:26.240,-There's something else that we haven't thought of.
00:40:26.280,00:40:28.800,"Yes. Why is he doing this, the bomber?"
00:40:28.840,00:40:31.640,"If this woman's death was suspicious, why point it up?"
00:40:31.680,00:40:34.760,-Good Samaritan.
00:40:34.800,00:40:37.720,-Bad Samaritan.
00:40:37.760,00:40:46.080,"Listen, I'm cutting you slack here, I'm trusting you, but out there somewhere, some poor bastard's covered in Semtex and just waiting for you to solve the puzzle."
00:40:43.480,00:40:48.720,"So just tell me, what are we dealing with?"
00:40:50.480,00:40:51.960,Something new.
00:41:02.120,00:41:05.200,"Connection, connection, connection."
00:41:06.680,00:41:08.080,"Carl Powers, killed 20 years ago."
00:41:08.120,00:41:10.080,"The bomber knew him, admitted that he knew him."
00:41:10.120,00:41:12.960,The bomber's iPhone was in the stationery from the Czech Republic.
00:41:13.000,00:41:16.680,"The first hostage from Cornwall, the second from London, the third from Yorkshire, judging by her accent."
00:41:16.720,00:41:18.680,What's he doing?
00:41:23.040,00:41:27.240,"You're enjoying this, aren't you?"
00:41:29.040,00:41:31.880,Joining the...dots.
00:41:34.560,00:41:37.160,-Three hours.
00:41:39.480,00:41:40.680,Boom...
00:41:41.920,00:41:43.040,Boom.
00:41:55.400,00:41:58.200,"We're devastated, of course we are."
00:42:02.400,00:42:03.600,"Can I get you anything, sir?"
00:42:03.640,00:42:05.160,"Uh, no. No, thanks."
00:42:08.160,00:42:09.880,Raoul is my rock.
00:42:09.920,00:42:11.640,I don't think I could have managed.
00:42:13.600,00:42:20.120,"We didn't always see eye to eye, -but my sister was very dear to me."
00:42:20.160,00:42:22.800,"And to the, uh, public, Mr Prince."
00:42:22.840,00:42:25.960,"Oh, she was adored."
00:42:26.000,00:42:32.560,I've seen her take girls who looked like the back end of Routemasters and turn them into princesses.
00:42:37.600,00:42:39.760,-Absolutely.
00:42:40.800,00:42:42.440,Great.
00:42:42.480,00:42:43.840,Thank you. Thanks again.
00:42:43.880,00:42:46.280,It's a real shame.
00:42:46.320,00:42:48.600,-She taught you how to do your colours.
00:42:48.640,00:42:49.840,Colours?
00:42:49.880,00:42:52.840,"You know, what goes best with what."
00:42:52.880,00:42:55.240,"I should never wear cerise, apparently."
00:42:55.280,00:42:57.960,-Drains me.
00:42:58.000,00:42:59.440,-Home office.
00:42:59.480,00:43:02.000,"Well, home secretary actually."
00:43:02.040,00:43:05.160,"She's a pretty girl, but she messed about with herself too much."
00:43:05.200,00:43:06.480,They all do these days.
00:43:06.520,00:43:08.960,People can hardly move their faces.
00:43:09.000,00:43:10.640,"Is silly, isn't it?"
00:43:12.360,00:43:14.960,-Did you ever see her show?
00:43:19.120,00:43:21.120,"CONNIE: Oh, you look pasty, love."
00:43:21.160,00:43:24.160,"Ah, rained every day but one..."
00:43:24.200,00:43:26.320,That's the brother.
00:43:24.200,00:43:28.520,"No love lost there, -if you can believe the papers."
00:43:28.560,00:43:31.960,I've just been having a very fruitful chat with people who love this show.
00:43:32.000,00:43:34.160,The fan site's indispensable for gossip.
00:43:35.120,00:43:36.640,"...Don't you think, girls?"
00:43:36.680,00:43:40.680,"Off, off, off, off, off, off, off!"
00:43:41.880,00:43:43.560,JOHN: It's more common than people think.
00:43:44.520,00:43:52.560,"The tetanus is in the soil, people cut themselves on rose bushes, garden forks, that sort of thing, and if left untreated..."
00:43:52.600,00:43:54.960,-I don't know what I'm going to do now.
00:43:56.680,00:44:00.760,"I mean, she's left me this place, which is lovely..."
00:44:02.920,00:44:06.600,-But it's not the same without her.
00:44:06.640,00:44:09.600,"...my paper wanted to get the, um..."
00:44:09.640,00:44:12.040,The full story straight from the horse's mouth.
00:44:12.080,00:44:13.200,Are you sure it's not too soon?
00:44:13.240,00:44:14.600,-No.
00:44:15.480,00:44:16.960,You fire away.
00:44:27.360,00:44:30.280,-John.
00:44:31.960,00:44:33.600,You'll need to pick up some stuff first.
00:44:33.640,00:44:34.840,I'll remember.
00:44:36.640,00:44:38.040,-JOHN: That'll be him.
00:44:39.640,00:44:41.600,"-Ah, Mr Prince, isn't it?"
00:44:41.640,00:44:43.440,-Very good to meet you.
00:44:43.480,00:44:45.240,-So sorry to hear about...
00:44:46.680,00:44:49.240,"Shall we, uh..."
00:44:49.280,00:44:51.720,"You were right, the bacteria got into her another way."
00:44:51.760,00:44:53.520,"-Oh, yes?"
00:44:53.560,00:44:56.360,"-Right, are we all set?"
00:44:59.240,00:45:01.760,-Not too close.
00:45:01.800,00:45:04.200,"-Oh, who's this?"
00:45:04.240,00:45:05.960,Named after the Egyptian goddess.
00:45:06.000,00:45:07.640,How nice. Was she Connie's?
00:45:07.680,00:45:09.720,"Yes, a little present from yours truly."
00:45:11.720,00:45:13.400,"Sherlock, light reading?"
00:45:13.440,00:45:15.400,"Oh, uh..."
00:45:15.440,00:45:16.680,-2.8.
00:45:16.720,00:45:19.240,-What are you playing at?
00:45:19.280,00:45:21.720,"You're like Laurel and bloody Hardy, you two!"
00:45:21.760,00:45:23.560,"Actually, I think we've got what we came for."
00:45:23.600,00:45:24.680,-What?
00:45:24.720,00:45:25.760,-What?
00:45:26.600,00:45:28.360,But you've not taken anything!
00:45:32.880,00:45:35.520,"Yes! Ooh, yes!"
00:45:35.560,00:45:37.720,You think it was the cat.
00:45:37.760,00:45:39.440,"Not... Yes. Yeah, it is."
00:45:39.480,00:45:41.800,It must be.
00:45:41.840,00:45:44.640,-Its paws stink of disinfectant.
00:45:44.680,00:45:47.400,"No, he coated it onto the claws of her cat."
00:45:50.000,00:45:52.360,A scratch is almost inevitable.
00:45:52.400,00:45:56.520,"I thought of it the minute I saw the scratches on her arm, but it's too random and too clever for the brother."
00:45:57.800,00:46:00.440,-He murdered his sister for her money.
00:46:00.480,00:46:01.800,-Didn't he?
00:46:01.840,00:46:03.080,It was revenge.
00:46:03.120,00:46:05.200,-Rev... Who wanted revenge?
00:46:05.240,00:46:09.160,"Kenny Prince was the butt of his sister's jokes week in, week out."
00:46:09.200,00:46:12.000,Finally he had enough.
00:46:13.240,00:46:14.800,She threatened to disinherit Kenny.
00:46:14.840,00:46:16.920,Raoul had grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle...
00:46:16.960,00:46:21.040,Wait. Wait. Wait a second.
00:46:21.080,00:46:26.120,"Raoul keeps a very clean house. You came through the kitchen door, saw the state of that floor, scrubbed within an inch of its life."
00:46:26.160,00:46:29.360,You smell of disinfectant.
00:46:29.400,00:46:32.280,"Raoul's Internet records do, though. I hope we can get a cab from here."
00:46:42.080,00:46:44.480,Raoul de Santos is your killer.
00:46:44.520,00:46:46.200,Kenny Prince's houseboy.
00:46:46.240,00:46:51.680,"Second autopsy shows it wasn't tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince, it was botulinum toxin."
00:46:51.720,00:46:54.560,We've been here before.
00:46:54.600,00:46:56.800,-Our bomber's repeated himself.
00:46:56.840,00:46:58.640,-Botox injection.
00:46:58.680,00:47:01.640,Botox is a diluted form of botulinum.
00:46:58.680,00:47:05.320,"Among other things, Raoul de Santos was employed to give Connie her regular facial injections."
00:47:05.360,00:47:08.920,My contact at the home office gave me the complete records of Raoul's Internet purchases.
00:47:08.960,00:47:11.240,He's been bulk-ordering Botox for months.
00:47:11.280,00:47:14.000,"Bided his time, then upped the strength to a fatal dose."
00:47:14.040,00:47:15.960,-Are you sure about this?
00:47:16.000,00:47:17.720,"All right, my office."
00:47:17.760,00:47:19.240,"-Hey, Sherlock, how long?"
00:47:19.280,00:47:20.480,How long have you known?
00:47:20.520,00:47:22.400,"Well, this one was quite simple actually."
00:47:22.440,00:47:24.560,"And like I said, the bomber repeated himself."
00:47:24.600,00:47:26.960,"Yeah, but Sherlock, the hostage, the old woman, she's been there all this time!"
00:47:27.000,00:47:28.280,I knew I could save her.
00:47:28.320,00:47:30.560,I also knew that the bomber had given us 12 hours.
00:47:30.600,00:47:33.080,"I solved the case quickly, that gave me time to get on with other things."
00:47:33.120,00:47:35.560,Don't you see?
00:47:55.080,00:47:56.240,Hello?
00:47:57.680,00:47:59.320,Help me!
00:48:00.200,00:48:02.360,Tell us where you are.
00:48:02.400,00:48:04.720,-Address?
00:48:05.920,00:48:07.440,His voice...
00:48:07.480,00:48:09.680,"No, no, no, no!"
00:48:09.720,00:48:12.960,He sounded so soft.
00:48:16.040,00:48:17.200,Hello?
00:48:17.720,00:48:19.000,Sherlock?
00:48:20.640,00:48:22.240,JOHN: What's happened?
00:48:34.480,00:48:38.640,"REPORTER: The explosion, which ripped through several floors, killing 12 people..."
00:48:38.680,00:48:39.760,Old block of flats.
00:48:39.800,00:48:42.000,...caused by a faulty gas main.
00:48:42.040,00:48:43.440,A spokesman from the utility company...
00:48:43.480,00:48:45.440,He certainly gets about.
00:48:46.720,00:48:48.480,"Well, obviously I lost that round."
00:48:48.520,00:48:50.600,"Although technically, I did solve the case."
00:48:54.520,00:48:57.880,He killed the old lady because she started to describe him.
00:48:57.920,00:49:00.760,"Just once, he put himself in the firing line."
00:49:00.800,00:49:02.000,What do you mean?
00:49:02.040,00:49:06.200,"Well, usually, he must stay above it all."
00:49:06.240,00:49:09.840,"He organises these things, but no one ever has direct contact."
00:49:09.880,00:49:13.440,"What, like the Connie Prince murder, he arranged that?"
00:49:14.760,00:49:18.440,So people come to him wanting their crimes fixed up like booking a holiday?
00:49:18.960,00:49:20.120,Novel.
00:49:22.960,00:49:24.040,Huh!
00:49:35.680,00:49:37.480,Taking his time this time.
00:49:41.680,00:49:43.480,Anything on the Carl Powers case?
00:49:43.520,00:49:45.880,Nothing.
00:49:45.920,00:49:49.360,"All the living classmates check out spotless, no connection."
00:49:49.400,00:49:52.480,-Maybe the killer was older than Carl?
00:49:52.520,00:49:54.080,"So why is he doing this, then?"
00:49:54.120,00:49:56.240,Playing this game with you.
00:49:58.000,00:50:00.160,-I think he wants to be distracted.
00:50:01.320,00:50:04.680,I hope you'll be very happy together.
00:50:04.720,00:50:08.440,"-Sorry, what?"
00:50:08.480,00:50:12.160,Actual human lives!
00:50:12.200,00:50:14.400,-Will caring about them help save them?
00:50:14.440,00:50:16.120,Then I'll continue not to make that mistake.
00:50:16.160,00:50:17.960,"-And you find that easy, do you?"
00:50:18.960,00:50:21.160,-Is that news to you?
00:50:24.840,00:50:26.120,I've disappointed you.
00:50:26.160,00:50:28.520,"That's good, that's a good deduction, yeah."
00:50:28.560,00:50:30.280,"Don't make people into heroes, John."
00:50:30.320,00:50:32.480,"Heroes don't exist, and if they did, I wouldn't be one of them."
00:50:38.360,00:50:39.840,A view of the Thames.
00:50:39.880,00:50:42.280,"South Bank, somewhere between Southwark Bridge and Waterloo."
00:50:44.800,00:50:46.440,"You check the papers, I'll look online."
00:50:48.880,00:50:50.960,"Oh, you're angry with me, so you won't help."
00:50:51.000,00:50:53.320,"Not much cop, this caring lark."
00:51:13.080,00:51:14.920,-Archway suicide...
00:51:18.880,00:51:21.040,Two kids stabbed in Stoke Newington.
00:51:22.320,00:51:24.400,Ah.
00:51:24.440,00:51:26.480,"Man found on the train line, Andrew West."
00:51:26.520,00:51:27.800,-Nothing!
00:51:31.000,00:51:34.480,It's me. Have you found anything on the South Bank between Waterloo Bridge and Southwark Bridge?
00:51:56.160,00:51:58.600,"Do you reckon this is connected, then, the bomber?"
00:51:58.640,00:52:00.840,SHERLOCK: Must be.
00:52:00.880,00:52:04.120,"Then we must assume that some poor bugger's primed to explode, yeah?"
00:52:04.160,00:52:05.640,Yes.
00:52:05.680,00:52:08.600,-Any ideas?
00:52:08.960,00:52:10.120,Seven?
00:52:40.520,00:52:42.760,He's dead about 24 hours.
00:52:44.360,00:52:45.640,Maybe a bit longer.
00:52:45.680,00:52:47.680,Did he drown?
00:52:47.720,00:52:49.960,LESTRADE: Apparently not.
00:52:50.000,00:52:51.760,"Yes, I'd agree."
00:52:51.800,00:52:55.920,There's quite a bit of bruising around the nose and mouth.
00:52:57.920,00:53:01.520,More bruises here and here.
00:53:05.960,00:53:07.320,Fingertips.
00:53:08.920,00:53:12.160,"He's late 30s, I'd say, not in the best condition."
00:53:12.200,00:53:13.760,He's been in the river a long while.
00:53:13.800,00:53:15.880,The water's destroyed most of the data.
00:53:17.800,00:53:19.320,But I'll tell you one thing.
00:53:19.360,00:53:21.400,That lost Vermeer painting's a fake.
00:53:21.440,00:53:23.360,-What?
00:53:21.440,00:53:25.400,"-We need to identify the corpse, -find out about his friends and..."
00:53:25.440,00:53:27.440,What painting?
00:53:27.480,00:53:29.400,"It's all over the place, haven't you seen the posters?"
00:53:29.440,00:53:32.040,"Dutch old master, supposed to have been destroyed centuries ago."
00:53:32.080,00:53:35.000,"Now it's turned up, worth £30 million."
00:53:35.040,00:53:37.840,"Okay, so what has that got to do with the stiff?"
00:53:37.880,00:53:39.280,Everything.
00:53:39.320,00:53:40.760,Have you ever heard of the Golem?
00:53:41.080,00:53:42.360,Golem?
00:53:42.400,00:53:44.280,"It's a horror story, isn't it?"
00:53:44.320,00:53:46.760,A Jewish folk story.
00:53:46.800,00:53:48.320,It's also the name of an assassin.
00:53:48.360,00:53:49.640,Real name Oscar Dzundza.
00:53:49.680,00:53:51.320,One of the deadliest assassins in the world.
00:53:51.360,00:53:53.440,That is his trademark style.
00:53:53.480,00:53:55.480,-So this is a hit?
00:53:55.520,00:53:58.520,The Golem squeezes the life out of his victims with his bare hands.
00:53:58.560,00:54:01.200,But what has this got to do with that painting?
00:54:01.240,00:54:03.120,"You do see, you just don't observe!"
00:54:03.160,00:54:04.760,"Yes, all right, all right, girls!"
00:54:06.440,00:54:08.880,"Sherlock, do you want to take us through it?"
00:54:11.960,00:54:14.360,What do we know about this corpse?
00:54:14.400,00:54:18.400,"The killer's not left us with much, just the shirt and the trousers."
00:54:18.440,00:54:20.360,"They're pretty formal, maybe he was going out for the night."
00:54:20.400,00:54:21.840,The trousers are heavy-duty.
00:54:21.880,00:54:24.040,Polyester. Nasty.
00:54:24.080,00:54:27.160,They're both too big for him.
00:54:27.200,00:54:29.120,"Dressed for work, then."
00:54:29.160,00:54:31.800,"There's a hook on his belt, for a walkie-talkie."
00:54:31.840,00:54:33.560,Tube driver?
00:54:33.600,00:54:35.080,-Security guard?
00:54:35.120,00:54:37.360,-That'll be borne out by his backside.
00:54:37.400,00:54:43.800,"Flabby, you'd think he'd led a sedentary life, yet the soles of his feet and the nascent varicose veins in his legs show otherwise."
00:54:45.160,00:54:47.920,"So, a lot of walking and a lot of sitting around."
00:54:47.960,00:54:50.400,Security guard's looking good.
00:54:50.440,00:54:52.560,The alarm shows he did regular night shifts.
00:54:52.600,00:54:55.040,Why regular? Maybe he just set his alarm like that the night before he died.
00:54:55.080,00:54:58.040,"No, no, no."
00:54:58.080,00:55:00.640,"He set his alarm like that a long time ago, his routine never varied."
00:55:00.680,00:55:02.520,But there's something else.
00:55:00.680,00:55:04.280,"The killer must have been interrupted, otherwise he would have stripped the corpse completely."
00:55:04.320,00:55:11.440,"There was some kind of badge or insignia on the shirt front that he tore off, suggesting the dead man worked somewhere recognisable, some kind of institution."
00:55:11.480,00:55:14.160,I found this inside his trouser pockets.
00:55:18.640,00:55:19.880,-Tickets?
00:55:19.920,00:55:21.280,He worked in a museum or gallery.
00:55:21.320,00:55:23.200,Did a quick check.
00:55:21.320,00:55:24.800,The Hickman gallery has reported one of its attendants is missing.
00:55:24.840,00:55:26.600,Alex Woodbridge.
00:55:26.640,00:55:29.040,"Tonight, they unveil the rediscovered masterpiece."
00:55:29.080,00:55:34.600,"Now, why would anyone want to pay the Golem to suffocate a perfectly ordinary gallery attendant?"
00:55:34.640,00:55:39.640,"Inference, the dead man knew something about it, something that would stop the owner getting paid £30 million."
00:55:39.680,00:55:41.520,The pictures are fake.
00:55:41.560,00:55:42.800,Fantastic.
00:55:42.840,00:55:44.400,-Meretricious.
00:55:46.920,00:55:47.960,Poor sod.
00:55:49.880,00:55:51.960,I'd better get my feelers out for this Golem character.
00:55:52.000,00:55:54.560,"Pointless, you'll never find him, but I know a man who can."
00:55:54.600,00:55:55.880,-Who?
00:56:03.080,00:56:06.360,Why hasn't he phoned?
00:56:08.760,00:56:10.360,Waterloo Bridge.
00:56:10.400,00:56:13.560,"-Where now, the gallery?"
00:56:13.600,00:56:15.640,"The Hickman's contemporary art, isn't it?"
00:56:15.680,00:56:18.200,-Why have they got hold of an old master?
00:56:18.240,00:56:19.760,It's dangerous to jump to conclusions.
00:56:21.280,00:56:22.600,Need data.
00:56:39.760,00:56:41.440,Stop!
00:56:41.480,00:56:42.960,Can you wait here?
00:56:43.000,00:56:44.760,I won't be a moment.
00:56:45.480,00:56:46.760,Sherlock?
00:56:54.160,00:56:56.480,Change? Any change?
00:56:56.520,00:56:59.280,-What for?
00:56:59.320,00:57:00.480,"Here you go, 50."
00:57:02.560,00:57:03.760,Thanks.
00:57:05.360,00:57:07.640,-What are you doing?
00:57:17.160,00:57:19.920,Now we go to the gallery.
00:57:35.400,00:57:38.840,"No, I need you to find out all you can about the gallery attendant."
00:57:38.880,00:57:41.240,-Lestrade will give you the address.
00:57:54.920,00:57:56.840,We'd been sharing about a year.
00:57:57.640,00:57:59.360,-Just sharing.
00:58:10.760,00:58:12.200,-May I?
00:58:14.920,00:58:16.080,Sorry.
00:58:17.040,00:58:18.440,"Stargazer, was he?"
00:58:18.480,00:58:21.520,"God, yeah. Mad about it."
00:58:21.560,00:58:24.240,It's all he ever did in his spare time.
00:58:24.280,00:58:26.560,"He was a nice guy, Alex."
00:58:26.600,00:58:28.000,I liked him.
00:58:29.720,00:58:32.000,"He was, uh..."
00:58:32.040,00:58:39.440,Never much of a one What about art?
00:58:39.480,00:58:41.640,"It was just a job, you know?"
00:58:42.120,00:58:43.200,Mmm.
00:58:45.720,00:58:48.440,Has anyone else been round asking about Alex?
00:58:49.120,00:58:51.000,No.
00:58:51.040,00:58:53.440,"-We had a break-in, though."
00:58:53.480,00:58:57.000,Last night.
00:58:57.040,00:59:01.480,"Oh, there was a message left for Alex on the land line."
00:59:01.520,00:59:03.000,Who was it from?
00:59:03.040,00:59:04.880,"Well, I can play it for you if you like."
00:59:04.920,00:59:06.120,Please.
00:59:12.480,00:59:14.880,"WOMAN: Oh, should I speak now?"
00:59:14.920,00:59:16.560,"Love, it's Professor Cairns."
00:59:19.800,00:59:22.040,-Give us a call when...
00:59:22.080,00:59:23.680,Professor Cairns?
00:59:23.720,00:59:25.520,"-No idea, sorry."
00:59:26.880,00:59:28.680,Can I try and ring back?
00:59:28.720,00:59:32.360,No good.
00:59:32.400,00:59:33.720,"Sympathy ones, you know."
00:59:57.600,00:59:59.880,Don't you have something to do?
00:59:59.920,01:00:01.320,SHERLOCK: Just admiring the view.
01:00:02.080,01:00:03.480,Yes.
01:00:03.520,01:00:05.760,Lovely. Now get back to work.
01:00:07.520,01:00:09.520,-Doesn't it bother you?
01:00:09.560,01:00:11.040,That the painting's a fake.
01:00:12.160,01:00:13.600,-What?
01:00:13.640,01:00:15.360,It has to be.
01:00:15.400,01:00:18.200,"You are in charge, aren't you, Miss Wenceslas?"
01:00:18.240,01:00:19.600,Who are you?
01:00:19.640,01:00:23.320,"Alex Woodbridge knew that the painting was a fake, so somebody sent the Golem to take care of him."
01:00:23.360,01:00:25.280,Golem? What the hell are you talking about?
01:00:25.320,01:00:28.520,Are you working for someone else?
01:00:28.560,01:00:31.360,-It's not a fake.
01:00:31.400,01:00:33.560,I don't know why.
01:00:33.600,01:00:34.840,What the hell are you on about?
01:00:34.880,01:00:36.400,Do you know I could have you sacked on the spot.
01:00:36.440,01:00:37.680,Not a problem.
01:00:37.720,01:00:39.480,-No?
01:00:39.520,01:00:41.680,Just popped in to give you a bit of friendly advice.
01:00:42.360,01:00:44.080,How did you get in?
01:00:44.120,01:00:45.680,-Please!
01:00:45.720,01:00:49.120,The art of disguise is knowing how to hide in plain sight.
01:00:49.160,01:00:51.440,-Who are you?
01:00:51.480,01:00:53.400,Am I supposed to be impressed?
01:00:53.440,01:00:54.920,You should be.
01:01:13.160,01:01:14.880,LUCY: He wouldn't.
01:01:15.680,01:01:16.920,-He just wouldn't.
01:01:18.080,01:01:19.280,Stranger things have happened.
01:01:19.320,01:01:21.240,Westie wasn't a traitor.
01:01:22.200,01:01:23.600,That's a horrible thing to say!
01:01:23.640,01:01:26.600,I'm sorry.
01:01:26.640,01:01:28.800,"That's what they think, isn't it, his bosses?"
01:01:28.840,01:01:31.840,"He was young man, about to get married, he had debts."
01:01:31.880,01:01:38.600,"Everyone's got debts, and Westie wouldn't want to clear them by selling out his country."
01:01:38.640,01:01:42.560,"Can you, um..."
01:01:43.400,01:01:45.440,We were having a night in.
01:01:46.560,01:01:49.040,Just watching a DVD.
01:01:49.080,01:01:52.000,"He normally falls asleep, you know, but he sat through this one."
01:01:54.840,01:01:56.040,He was quiet.
01:01:57.920,01:02:00.480,Out of the blue he said he just had to go and see someone.
01:02:01.840,01:02:03.000,And you've no idea who?
01:02:11.440,01:02:13.640,"Hi, Luce. You okay, love?"
01:02:13.680,01:02:15.760,-Yeah.
01:02:15.800,01:02:17.640,"John Watson, hi."
01:02:17.680,01:02:19.360,"This is my brother, Joe."
01:02:19.400,01:02:21.640,"John's trying to find out what happened to Westie, Joe."
01:02:21.680,01:02:23.960,-You with the police?
01:02:24.000,01:02:26.600,"Tell them to get off their arses, will you?"
01:02:26.640,01:02:28.240,I'll do my best.
01:02:33.160,01:02:35.760,"Well, uh..."
01:02:35.800,01:02:38.880,"Thanks very much for your help. And again, I'm very, very sorry."
01:02:40.400,01:02:42.760,"He didn't steal those things, Mr Watson."
01:02:44.280,01:02:46.480,"I knew Westie, he was a good man."
01:02:47.720,01:02:49.440,He was my good man.
01:03:13.120,01:03:14.800,-Spare change?
01:03:15.600,01:03:17.240,Any spare change?
01:03:24.720,01:03:26.480,Alex Woodbridge didn't know anything special about art.
01:03:26.520,01:03:28.400,-And?
01:03:28.440,01:03:30.720,Is that it?
01:03:30.760,01:03:33.040,Give us a chance.
01:03:33.080,01:03:34.560,Hold that cab.
01:03:34.600,01:03:36.440,"-Spare change, sir?"
01:03:36.480,01:03:37.680,JOHN: Can you wait here?
01:03:41.400,01:03:43.560,"Fortunately, I haven't been idle."
01:03:44.360,01:03:45.480,Come on.
01:04:08.840,01:04:10.440,"Beautiful, isn't it?"
01:04:14.160,01:04:15.240,I thought you didn't care about...
01:04:15.280,01:04:18.280,Doesn't mean I can't appreciate it.
01:04:18.320,01:04:21.800,"JOHN: Listen, Alex Woodbridge had a message on the answerphone at his flat."
01:04:21.840,01:04:24.800,-A Professor Cairns.
01:04:24.840,01:04:27.840,Nice. Nice part of town.
01:04:31.200,01:04:34.520,"-Uh, any time you want to explain?"
01:04:34.560,01:04:37.640,-Really is indispensable.
01:04:37.680,01:04:39.000,"My eyes and ears, all over the city."
01:04:39.040,01:04:40.960,"Ah, that's...clever."
01:04:41.000,01:04:43.800,"-So you scratch their backs, and..."
01:05:04.320,01:05:05.600,Sherlock! Come on!
01:05:08.880,01:05:10.720,"What's he doing, sleeping rough?"
01:05:10.760,01:05:12.120,"Well, he has a very distinctive look."
01:05:12.160,01:05:13.920,He has to hide somewhere where tongues won't wag...
01:05:13.960,01:05:15.040,Much.
01:05:15.080,01:05:16.640,"-Oh, sh..."
01:05:16.680,01:05:18.320,-I wish I...
01:05:27.360,01:05:29.080,No! No! No! No!
01:05:30.280,01:05:33.720,It'll take us weeks to find him again.
01:05:33.760,01:05:35.800,Or not. I have an idea where he might be going.
01:05:35.840,01:05:37.360,-What?
01:05:37.400,01:05:39.200,Someone left Alex Woodbridge a message.
01:05:39.240,01:05:41.840,There can't be that many Professor Cairns in the book. Come on.
01:05:49.200,01:05:54.120,"MAN: Jupiter, the fifth planet in our solar system, and the largest."
01:05:54.160,01:05:59.120,Jupiter is a gas giant.
01:05:59.160,01:06:00.920,"-Yes, we know that."
01:06:04.920,01:06:07.760,-MAN: Titan is the largest moon...
01:06:14.560,01:06:16.440,Many are actually long dead...
01:06:16.480,01:06:19.160,"-Tom, is that you?"
01:06:21.280,01:06:24.720,Discovered by Urbain Le Verrier in 1846...
01:06:28.680,01:06:31.360,-...composed mainly of hydrogen.
01:06:31.400,01:06:33.240,Their light would take so long to reach us...
01:06:33.280,01:06:35.000,Golem!
01:06:35.040,01:06:38.520,"...many are actually long dead, exploded into..."
01:06:41.520,01:06:42.880,JOHN: I can't see him.
01:06:45.680,01:06:47.400,"SHERLOCK: Who are you working for this time, Dzundza?"
01:06:52.720,01:06:56.000,MAN: A star begins as a collapsing ball of material composed mainly of...
01:06:56.040,01:06:57.200,-Golem!
01:07:00.720,01:07:05.040,Let him go or I will kill you.
01:07:12.680,01:07:18.240,MAN: The fourth planet of the solar system named after the Roman god of war.
01:07:26.120,01:07:27.800,...it is a gas giant...

01:07:49.760,01:07:52.000,...exploded into supernovas...
01:07:54.360,01:07:56.320,SHERLOCK: It's a fake.
01:07:56.360,01:07:59.160,That painting has been subjected to every test known to science.
01:07:59.200,01:08:00.560,"It's a very good fake, then."
01:08:00.600,01:08:03.520,"You know about this, don't you?"
01:08:03.560,01:08:05.160,"Inspector, my time is being wasted."
01:08:05.200,01:08:08.840,Would you mind showing yourself -and your friends out?
01:08:09.880,01:08:10.960,The painting is a fake.
01:08:13.080,01:08:15.240,"It's a fake, that's why Woodbridge and Cairns were killed."
01:08:18.480,01:08:21.840,"Oh, come on, proving it's just a detail."
01:08:21.880,01:08:24.040,"I've solved it, I've figured it out."
01:08:24.080,01:08:26.200,"It's a fake, that's the answer, that's why they were killed."
01:08:32.000,01:08:34.640,"Okay, I'll prove it."
01:08:36.240,01:08:38.000,BOY: Ten...
01:08:38.040,01:08:40.280,It's a kid.
01:08:40.320,01:08:41.760,-What did he say?
01:08:41.800,01:08:44.040,-BOY: Nine...
01:08:44.080,01:08:45.480,-Jesus...
01:08:44.080,01:08:46.840,"-The painting is a fake, but how can I prove it?"
01:08:46.880,01:08:48.400,BOY: Eight...
01:08:48.440,01:08:50.640,This kid will die. Tell me why the painting is a fake.
01:08:50.680,01:08:52.640,-BOY: Seven...
01:08:52.680,01:08:53.920,It only works if I figure it out.
01:08:55.960,01:08:58.280,possible. It must be staring me in the face.
01:08:58.320,01:08:59.760,-BOY: Six...
01:09:01.080,01:09:03.040,"-Woodbridge knew, but how?"
01:09:03.080,01:09:04.200,-It's speeding up!
01:09:06.120,01:09:07.320,-Oh!
01:09:07.360,01:09:08.640,"In the Planetarium, you heard it too."
01:09:08.680,01:09:10.280,"Oh, that is brilliant, that is gorgeous!"
01:09:10.320,01:09:12.560,-BOY: Three...
01:09:12.600,01:09:14.800,This is beautiful. Love this!
01:09:14.840,01:09:16.720,-BOY: Two...
01:09:16.760,01:09:18.520,The Van Buren Supernova.
01:09:20.440,01:09:24.440,"BOY: Please, is somebody there?"
01:09:24.480,01:09:27.280,There you go. Go and find out where he is and pick him up.
01:09:29.480,01:09:33.160,"Van Buren Supernova, so-called."
01:09:33.200,01:09:36.400,Exploding star.
01:09:38.320,01:09:43.640,So how could it have been painted in the 1640s?
01:09:44.400,01:09:45.760,-Oh...
01:09:46.440,01:09:47.920,-Oh.
01:09:50.400,01:09:52.240,"Oh, Sherlock..."
01:09:55.160,01:09:58.360,"You know, it's interesting."
01:09:55.160,01:10:03.240,"Bohemian stationery, an assassin named after a Prague legend, and you, Miss Wenceslas."
01:10:03.280,01:10:05.720,This whole case has a distinctly Czech feeling about it.
01:10:05.760,01:10:07.760,Is that where this leads?
01:10:09.520,01:10:11.360,"What are we looking at, Inspector?"
01:10:12.560,01:10:17.840,"Well, criminal conspiracy, fraud, accessory after the fact, at the very least."
01:10:17.880,01:10:20.280,"The murder of the old woman, all the people in the flat..."
01:10:20.320,01:10:23.240,I didn't know anything about that.
01:10:23.280,01:10:25.280,"All those things, please, believe me."
01:10:27.560,01:10:28.680,I just wanted my share.
01:10:30.800,01:10:32.320,The 30 million.
01:10:40.520,01:10:42.720,I found a little old man in Argentina.
01:10:45.040,01:10:47.720,A genius...
01:10:49.240,01:10:51.200,-Could fool anyone.
01:10:53.240,01:10:55.000,"Well, nearly anyone."
01:10:57.680,01:11:01.480,But I didn't know how to go about convincing the world the picture was genuine.
01:11:03.760,01:11:05.520,It was just an idea.
01:11:07.040,01:11:09.200,A spark which he blew into a flame.
01:11:09.240,01:11:10.320,Who?
01:11:11.400,01:11:12.600,I don't know.
01:11:12.640,01:11:14.320,-It's true!
01:11:15.680,01:11:21.280,"It took a long time, but eventually I was put in touch with people."
01:11:23.560,01:11:24.920,His people.
01:11:26.760,01:11:29.000,"Well, there was never any real contact."
01:11:31.400,01:11:33.240,Just messages...
01:11:36.720,01:11:38.080,Whispers.
01:11:39.160,01:11:42.080,And did those whispers have a name?
01:11:51.920,01:11:53.200,Moriarty.
01:12:08.760,01:12:11.680,-WATSON: So this is where West was found?
01:12:11.720,01:12:13.760,-Are you going to be long?
01:12:13.800,01:12:15.320,"-Are you the police, then?"
01:12:15.360,01:12:16.640,I hate 'em.
01:12:16.680,01:12:19.440,-The police?
01:12:19.480,01:12:22.960,People who chuck themselves in front of trains.
01:12:23.000,01:12:25.720,"Well, that's one way of looking at it."
01:12:25.760,01:12:28.000,I mean it.
01:12:28.040,01:12:30.760,It's over in a split second.
01:12:30.800,01:12:32.560,"What about the drivers, eh?"
01:12:32.600,01:12:34.240,"They've got to live with it, haven't they?"
01:12:34.280,01:12:38.320,"Yeah, speaking of strawberry jam, there's no blood on the line."
01:12:38.360,01:12:40.600,-Has it been cleaned off?
01:12:41.920,01:12:43.520,You said his head was smashed in.
01:12:43.560,01:12:45.640,"It was, but there wasn't much blood."
01:12:47.200,01:12:48.320,Okay.
01:12:51.160,01:12:52.920,"Well, I'll leave you to it, then."
01:12:52.960,01:12:55.360,-Just give us a shout when you're off.
01:12:57.240,01:13:03.800,"Right, so, Andrew West got on the train somewhere. Or did he?"
01:13:04.840,01:13:06.480,There was no ticket on the body.
01:13:08.400,01:13:09.920,How did he end up here?
01:13:17.480,01:13:19.480,-The points.
01:13:19.520,01:13:21.480,I knew you'd get there eventually.
01:13:21.520,01:13:24.240,"West wasn't killed here, that's why there was so little blood."
01:13:24.280,01:13:26.560,-How long have you been following me?
01:13:26.600,01:13:32.320,"You don't think I'd give up on a case like this just to spite my brother, do you?"
01:13:32.360,01:13:34.400,"Come on, we've got a bit of burglary to do."
01:13:38.880,01:13:43.760,"Missile defence plans haven't left the country, otherwise Mycroft's people would have heard about it."
01:13:43.800,01:13:46.880,"Despite what people think, we do still have a secret service."
01:13:46.920,01:13:49.120,"Yeah, I know, I've met them."
01:13:49.160,01:13:53.400,Which means whoever stole the memory stick can't sell it or doesn't know what to do with it.
01:13:53.440,01:13:55.200,My money's on the latter.
01:13:55.920,01:13:57.120,We're here.
01:13:57.160,01:13:58.320,Where?
01:14:07.320,01:14:10.400,What if there's someone in?
01:14:16.800,01:14:18.640,JOHN: Jesus...
01:14:19.600,01:14:20.800,Where are we?
01:14:20.840,01:14:22.840,"Oh, sorry, didn't I say?"
01:14:23.360,01:14:24.520,JOHN: Joe...
01:14:27.360,01:14:30.800,Brother of West's fiancee.
01:14:27.360,01:14:32.680,"He stole the memory stick, killed his prospective brother-in-law."
01:14:46.720,01:14:48.000,Then why did he do it?
01:14:50.640,01:14:52.800,-Let's ask him.
01:15:01.600,01:15:03.080,Don't! Don't.
01:15:08.480,01:15:09.680,He wasn't meant to...
01:15:14.080,01:15:17.400,What's Lucy gonna say? Jesus.
01:15:17.440,01:15:19.200,Why did you kill him?
01:15:19.240,01:15:20.480,-It was an accident.
01:15:20.520,01:15:21.880,I swear it was.
01:15:21.920,01:15:26.520,"But stealing the plans for the missile defense program wasn't an accident, was it?"
01:15:27.400,01:15:30.480,I started dealing drugs.
01:15:30.520,01:15:32.760,"I mean, the bike thing's a great cover, right?"
01:15:33.720,01:15:36.160,I don't know how it started.
01:15:36.200,01:15:38.960,I just got out of my depth.
01:15:39.000,01:15:42.800,I owed people thousands.
01:15:42.840,01:15:46.880,"Then at Westie's engagement do, he starts talking about his job."
01:15:49.360,01:15:52.480,"I mean, usually, he's so careful."
01:15:52.520,01:15:55.360,"But that night, after a few pints, he really opened up."
01:15:56.760,01:15:58.960,'He told me about these missile plans.
01:15:59.960,01:16:02.520,Beyond top secret.
01:16:02.560,01:16:05.680,"He showed me the memory stick, he waved it in front of me."
01:16:05.720,01:16:10.360,"You hear about these things getting lost, ending up on rubbish tips and whatnot."
01:16:11.560,01:16:14.240,But there it was.
01:16:14.280,01:16:17.040,"Well, I thought it could be worth a fortune."
01:16:17.080,01:16:20.120,"It was pretty easy to get the thing off him, he was so plastered."
01:16:22.920,01:16:28.280,"Next time I saw him, I could tell by the look on his face that he knew."
01:16:28.320,01:16:30.160,-What are you doing here?
01:16:30.200,01:16:31.200,What are you talking about?
01:16:32.240,01:16:33.760,What happened?
01:16:39.800,01:16:43.800,"I was going to call an ambulance, but it was too late."
01:16:43.840,01:16:46.120,I just didn't have a clue what to do.
01:16:47.200,01:16:49.800,So I dragged him in here.
01:16:49.840,01:16:53.480,"I just sat in the dark, thinking."
01:16:53.520,01:16:56.240,When a neat little idea popped into your head.
01:17:37.080,01:17:40.240,SHERLOCK: Carrying Andrew West way away from here.
01:17:40.280,01:17:44.360,His body would've gone on for ages if the train hadn't hit a stretch of track that curved.
01:17:44.400,01:17:46.160,-JOHN: And points.
01:17:50.440,01:17:52.600,"Do you still have it, then, the memory stick?"
01:17:54.560,01:17:57.040,"Fetch it for me, if you wouldn't mind."
01:18:06.960,01:18:08.760,"Distraction over, the game continues."
01:18:08.800,01:18:11.520,"Maybe that's over, too."
01:18:11.560,01:18:12.960,"Five pips, remember, John."
01:18:13.000,01:18:15.720,It's a countdown.
01:18:20.240,01:18:22.040,"No, no, no!"
01:18:22.080,01:18:24.480,Course he's not the boy's father.
01:18:24.520,01:18:26.920,Look at the turn-ups on his jeans!
01:18:28.960,01:18:31.480,-I knew it was dangerous.
01:18:31.520,01:18:33.880,-Getting you into crap telly.
01:18:33.920,01:18:36.680,Not a patch on Connie Prince.
01:18:36.720,01:18:38.440,Have you given Mycroft the memory stick yet?
01:18:38.480,01:18:40.520,Yep. He was over the moon.
01:18:41.840,01:18:44.160,Threatened me with a knighthood...again.
01:18:45.440,01:18:48.640,"-You know, I'm still waiting."
01:18:48.680,01:18:54.080,For you to admit that a little knowledge of the solar system and you'd have cleared up the fake painting a lot quicker.
01:18:54.120,01:18:55.560,"It didn't do you any good, did it?"
01:18:55.600,01:18:58.480,"No, but I'm not the world's only consulting detective."
01:18:58.520,01:19:00.800,-True.
01:19:00.840,01:19:02.400,I'm going to Sarah's.
01:19:02.440,01:19:04.000,There's still some of that risotto left in the fridge.
01:19:04.040,01:19:05.280,Mmm!
01:19:05.320,01:19:06.760,"-Ah, milk, we need milk."
01:19:06.800,01:19:08.320,-Really?
01:19:10.440,01:19:12.680,"-And some beans, then?"
01:20:26.400,01:20:28.680,Bought you a little getting-to-know-you present.
01:20:30.800,01:20:32.680,"That's what it's all been for, isn't it?"
01:20:35.200,01:20:38.160,"All your little puzzles, making me dance."
01:20:38.200,01:20:40.720,All to distract me from this.
01:20:53.920,01:20:55.160,Evening.
01:20:59.240,01:21:01.400,"This is a turn-up, isn't it, Sherlock?"
01:21:03.080,01:21:05.120,John! What the hell?
01:21:05.160,01:21:06.560,Bet you never saw this coming.
01:21:13.120,01:21:17.920,What would you like me to make him say...
01:21:18.720,01:21:19.720,...next?
01:21:21.560,01:21:26.160,"Gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear, -gottle o' gear."
01:21:26.920,01:21:28.560,"Nice touch, this."
01:21:28.600,01:21:32.120,"The pool, where little Carl died."
01:21:32.840,01:21:33.960,I stopped him.
01:21:36.360,01:21:38.360,"I can stop John Watson, too."
01:21:39.480,01:21:41.960,-Stop his heart.
01:21:44.280,01:21:46.080,MORIARTY: I gave you my number.
01:21:48.240,01:21:50.240,I thought you might call.
01:22:03.800,01:22:11.240,"Is that a British Army Browning L9A1 in your pocket, or are you just pleased to see me?"
01:22:12.160,01:22:13.280,Both.
01:22:15.520,01:22:16.960,Jim Moriarty.
01:22:18.040,01:22:19.080,Hi.
01:22:21.320,01:22:22.400,Jim?
01:22:23.560,01:22:25.400,Jim from the hospital?
01:22:27.640,01:22:30.800,"Oh, did I really make such a fleeting impression?"
01:22:30.840,01:22:33.680,"But then, I suppose, that was rather the point."
01:22:36.200,01:22:38.760,Don't be silly.
01:22:40.560,01:22:42.440,I don't like getting my hands dirty.
01:22:46.960,01:22:54.120,"I've given you a glimpse, Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse of what I've got going on out there in the big bad world."
01:22:55.560,01:22:58.080,"I'm a specialist, you see."
01:22:59.280,01:23:00.560,Like you.
01:23:01.200,01:23:10.240,"Dear Jim, please will you fix it for me to get rid of my lover's nasty sister?"
01:23:10.280,01:23:14.160,"Dear Jim, please will you fix it for me to disappear to South America?"
01:23:16.480,01:23:18.240,Consulting criminal.
01:23:19.320,01:23:20.840,Brilliant. Isn't it?
01:23:20.880,01:23:21.880,Isn't it?
01:23:23.240,01:23:25.160,No one ever gets to me.
01:23:27.800,01:23:29.400,And no one ever will.
01:23:29.440,01:23:30.640,-I did.
01:23:30.680,01:23:33.000,You've come the closest.
01:23:33.040,01:23:34.800,-Thank you.
01:23:34.840,01:23:37.480,"-Yes, you did."
01:23:37.520,01:23:38.720,"But the flirting's over, Sherlock."
01:23:38.760,01:23:41.680,Daddy's had enough now.
01:23:41.720,01:23:44.320,I've shown you what I can do.
01:23:44.360,01:23:51.280,"I cut loose all those people, all those little problems, even 30 million quid, just to get you to come out and play."
01:23:51.320,01:23:53.360,So take this as a friendly warning...
01:23:54.680,01:23:55.760,...my dear.
01:23:57.400,01:23:58.680,Back off.
01:24:00.400,01:24:06.000,"Although I have loved this, this little game of ours."
01:24:06.040,01:24:10.200,"Playing Jim from IT, playing gay."
01:24:10.240,01:24:11.600,Did you like the little touch with the underwear?
01:24:11.640,01:24:12.840,People have died.
01:24:12.880,01:24:14.400,That's what people do!
01:24:17.640,01:24:19.040,I will stop you.
01:24:19.080,01:24:20.240,"No, you won't."
01:24:20.280,01:24:21.640,Are you all right?
01:24:24.120,01:24:26.640,"You can talk, Johnny boy."
01:24:28.680,01:24:30.760,-Take it.
01:24:33.080,01:24:35.840,That? The missile plans.
01:24:40.400,01:24:42.240,Boring!
01:24:42.280,01:24:43.720,I could have got them anywhere.
01:24:44.840,01:24:46.000,"Sherlock, run!"
01:24:48.600,01:24:49.840,Good!
01:24:50.560,01:24:53.560,Very good.
01:24:53.600,01:24:57.880,"If your sniper pulls that trigger, Mr Moriarty, then we both go up."
01:24:57.920,01:25:00.280,Isn't he sweet?
01:25:00.320,01:25:03.000,"But then, people do get so sentimental about their pets."
01:25:03.880,01:25:05.320,They're so touchingly loyal.
01:25:05.360,01:25:06.680,But oops!
01:25:08.920,01:25:11.720,"You've rather shown your hand there, Dr Watson."
01:25:16.280,01:25:17.680,Gotcha.
01:25:22.040,01:25:24.080,Westwood.
01:25:24.120,01:25:26.600,"Do you know what happens if you don't leave me alone, Sherlock?"
01:25:26.640,01:25:28.160,Do you?
01:25:28.200,01:25:30.800,"Oh, let me guess."
01:25:30.840,01:25:32.160,Kill you?
01:25:32.200,01:25:34.480,"Mmm, no."
01:25:34.520,01:25:36.840,"I mean, I'm gonna kill you anyway someday."
01:25:36.880,01:25:38.440,"I don't want to rush it, though."
01:25:38.480,01:25:40.040,I'm saving it up for something special.
01:25:40.080,01:25:42.160,"No, no, no, no, no."
01:25:42.200,01:25:46.600,"If you don't stop prying, I'll burn you."
01:25:49.080,01:25:53.240,I'll burn the heart out of you.
01:25:55.280,01:25:58.320,I have been reliably informed that I don't have one.
01:25:58.360,01:26:00.360,But we both know that's not quite true.
01:26:03.960,01:26:06.080,"Well, I'd better be off."
01:26:07.840,01:26:10.080,"Well, so nice to have had a proper chat."
01:26:11.320,01:26:12.960,What if I was to shoot you now?
01:26:13.000,01:26:14.440,Right now?
01:26:14.480,01:26:17.360,Then you could cherish the look of surprise on my face.
01:26:19.600,01:26:21.080,"'Cause I'd be surprised, Sherlock."
01:26:21.120,01:26:23.040,"Really, I would."
01:26:23.080,01:26:25.040,And just a teensy bit...
01:26:25.760,01:26:27.200,Disappointed.
01:26:30.040,01:26:32.600,"And of course, you wouldn't be able to cherish it for very long."
01:26:34.200,01:26:36.840,"Ciao, Sherlock Holmes."
01:26:39.440,01:26:43.480,-Catch you...later.
01:26:45.200,01:26:47.040,"-No, you won't!"
01:26:52.920,01:26:54.880,All right?
01:26:54.920,01:26:57.200,-Are you all right?
01:26:58.000,01:26:59.800,I'm fine. Sherlock...
01:27:00.880,01:27:02.240,-Sherlock!
01:27:08.000,01:27:09.360,"-Oh, Christ."
01:27:19.680,01:27:23.280,-Are you okay?
01:27:26.080,01:27:28.200,"That, uh..."
01:27:28.240,01:27:30.040,...thing that you...
01:27:30.080,01:27:33.760,you offered to do...
01:27:34.800,01:27:35.920,Good.
01:27:37.640,01:27:40.880,-I'm glad no one saw that.
01:27:40.920,01:27:44.280,You ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool.
01:27:44.320,01:27:45.440,People might talk.
01:27:46.280,01:27:47.520,You would do little else.
01:27:54.480,01:27:56.480,-Oh...
01:27:56.520,01:27:59.440,I'm so changeable!
01:27:59.480,01:28:04.480,"It is a weakness with me, but to be fair to myself, it is my only weakness."
01:28:04.520,01:28:05.840,You can't be allowed to continue.
01:28:07.960,01:28:09.520,You just can't.
01:28:09.560,01:28:15.720,"I would try to convince you, but everything I have to say has already crossed your mind."
01:28:20.640,01:28:23.200,Probably my answer has crossed yours.
