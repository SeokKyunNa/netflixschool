Thank you. Jared,
prep the surgical team.

104
00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:41.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sir, what do I do?

105
00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:47.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Scut work.
-What's scut work?

106
00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Today I'm gonna
need my surgeons
to have no distractions.

107
00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:52.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
So I'm gonna need you
to handle those distractions.

108
00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:55.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
All the work they do every day
that they hate doing…

109
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You're handling it for them.

110
00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:03.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

111
00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:09.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Make sure
they know we still need
a consent on that one.

112
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Am I being punished
for something?
-No.

113
00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:20.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Okay.

114
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
So that's it?

115
00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You just accept my answer
at face value?

116
00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:26.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

117
00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're very arrogant.

118
00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Arrogant people don't think
they need to lie.

119
00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you must be
doing this to teach me.

120
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I look forward to learning
from scut work.

121
00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:43.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Say, "Ah."

122
00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Ah.

123
00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-How long will this be?
-Seven minutes.

124
00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Without any complications,
it takes seven minutes

125
00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:53.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
to do a discharge
examination properly.

126
00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:56.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Dr. Dunsmuir has already
cleared him to go
and we need the bed.

127
00:06:56.707 --> 00:07:00.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Okay. Protocol requires
that the surgical department
also clears him.

128
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have an ear infection.

129
00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Nurse Fryday] Yes,
that's why he's here.

130
00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
My hearing's been
a little muffled
and I've had some ringing.

131
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They gave him amoxicillin,
and we're sending him home.

132
00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which is why you're here.
To send him home.

133
00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:19.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd like an MRI of the head
and internal auditory meatus.

134
00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not being discharged?
What do you think is wrong?

135
00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:26.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll tell you
when I know for sure.

136
00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:28.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't wanna scare you.

137

138
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shaun. What are you
doing down here?

139
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:45.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm waiting for her to fart.

140
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Flatulence. But I'm
using the word "fart"
in front of the patient

141
00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to be more casual.

142
00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:53.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you're the president
of the hospital,

143
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'll say
"flatulence" to you.

144
00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I appreciate that.

145
00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you doing that?

146
00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
She had her deviated
septum repaired.
Before we can release her,

147
00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:04.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
we have to be sure
she isn't suffering
from postoperative ileus.

148
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah.

149
00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:12.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
This is what Dr. Melendez
feels you'll be most useful
doing today?

150
00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:14.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Waiting for farts?

151
00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not just
waiting for farts.

152
00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:18.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank goodness.
-I'm doing all the scut work.

153
00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, welcome
to your surgical residency.

154
00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:28.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

155
00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:33.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There. I think that was it.

156
00:08:38.142 --> 00:08:39.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think so.

157
00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll wait a little longer.
This is important.

158
00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The procedure
is called a laparotomy.

159
00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

160
00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, your heart
sounds good.

161
00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:58.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
So, we make a long
incision down the middle
of your abdomen…

162
00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Am I going to die?

163

Dr. Melendez
is the best surgeon
I have ever seen…

164
00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can this all wait?

165
00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
You have a very
serious condition.
It's not advisable to…

166
00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:14.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Just a couple of weeks.
My son is getting
married next weekend.

167
00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look very happy.

168
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
After the initial incision…

169
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
They've been
planning this for months.
If they have to reschedule…

170
00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Well, this is
complicated surgery,
but if all goes well,

171
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
recovery's pretty easy.

172
00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:30.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No need
to reschedule anything.

173
00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if it doesn't?
If it doesn't go well?

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:51.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't die right before
his wedding. I can't.

178
00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

179
00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:59.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You will be at the wedding.
Looking beautiful.

180
00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

181
00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:11.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
You're not supposed
to make promises
like that, Dr. Browne.

182
00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:13.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told her what
she needed to hear.

183
00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:17.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Officially, our legal
department's policy is
to tell the ugly truth.

184
00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:19.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The uglier the better.
Is that what you did?

185
00:10:19.493 --> 00:10:20.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think
that's what you did.

186
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, well,
it's a dumb policy.

187
00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:24.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
She needs to have
the surgery. Scaring her
would change nothing.

188
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Right. Because a much
better policy would be
to lie to all of our patients

189
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:28.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
whenever it makes
you feel better.

190
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
No, it doesn't make me
feel better.
It makes her feel better.

191
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:35.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm pathetic.

192
00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-I am pathetic.

193
00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:43.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And here's my thinking,
so just bear with me

194
00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:45.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it kind of
insults both of us.

195
00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:48.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00%

an hour ago
and you lied to her.

196
00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:52.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
A pity lie
because you obviously
care about her.

197
00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:55.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

zero upside for you.

205

about this?

206

Yeah. Which, in turn,
raises an interesting
medical question.

209
00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:30.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Why the hell
did this patient
get an MRI?

210
00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:33.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know
anything about this.

211
00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:36.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Yeah. Someone
on your team ordered it.
It's your responsibility,

212
00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which makes it your fault.

213
00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:40.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How did you…

214
00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.992 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's my department, it's my job
to know everything.

215
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, then,
since I work for you,

216
00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
doesn't that make
all this actually your fault?

217
00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry. I stopped listening
after "I work for you."

218
00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Shaun] Does that hurt?
-Yes.

219
00:11:57.466 --> 00:11:59.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Does that hurt?
-Yes.

220
00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
-Does that hurt?
-[Jerry] How much are we
paying for this?

221
00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
She has a tummy ache.
That's what they do,
they ache.

222
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's just trying
to get out of school. Again.

223
00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:08.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where do you think
she learned that from?

224
00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't think she hears you
calling in sick to work

225
00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
right before you go golfing?

226
00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:13.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like school.

227
00:12:13.941 --> 00:12:16.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Me, too. What did you eat
for dinner last night?

228
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
-Cereal.
-[Jerry] I thought
you made meatloaf.

229
00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:21.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did. And it got cold
while we were waiting for you.

230
00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want D-dimer,
lactate, and amylase…

231
00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:25.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What tests are you ordering?

232
00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:27.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
D-dimer, lactate, and amylase.

233
00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:30.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-For a tummy ache, hmm?
-Yes.

234
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm concerned it may be…

235
00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shall we talk outside?

236
00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cecile] Told you
something was wrong.

237
00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:40.593 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're happy she might be sick?

238
00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:41.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm happy you're wrong.

239
00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, let's talk outside.

240
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have they been bickering
like that the whole time?

241
00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:50.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't notice.
They aren't sick.

242
00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, they're
what we call a vector.

243
00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:55.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A carrier. A cause of disease.

244
00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:57.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You mean the parents?
-Yeah.

245
00:12:58.068 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That little girl
has a tummy ache

246
00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:01.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because Mommy and Daddy
won't stop fighting.

247
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This isn't a medical issue.
Send them home.

248
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
It could be intestinal
malrotation, which could
quickly become fatal.

249
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
And every patient
in this hospital
could have malaria,

250
00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:09.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but that doesn't mean
we're gonna go around

251
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
testing for every condition
we think they could have.

252
00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
For example, that MRI
you ordered on the guy
with the ear infection?

253
00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:17.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nice call, genius.
-Thank you.`

254
00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:19.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was being sarcastic.

255
00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's normal. He's healthy.
Send him home, too.

256
00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:26.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why are you smiling?
-Because you're right.

257
00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:29.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
So, you thought he was
making a mistake
and didn't say anything?

258
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just stood by
watching, taking notes,

259
00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
while he wasted
everybody's time?

260
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that your job?

261
00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:37.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
In my experience,
doctors don't listen
to nurses.

262
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And they only talk
to us to lecture us

263
00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:41.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when they figure
we screwed something up.

264
00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:48.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
From now on,
you don't run any tests
you don't have to run.

265
00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:51.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
How do I know
if a test is needed
until after I run it?

266
00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:55.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She'll tell you.
Today, she's your boss.

267
00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:10.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[indistinct chatter]

268
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:12.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[clears throat]

269
00:14:12.768 --> 00:14:14.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could never
eat before surgery.

270
00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Puke? I could do that.

271
00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:19.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I get cranky if I don't eat.

272
00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[inhales sharply]

273
00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:23.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hear Shaun made the call.

274
00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's an excellent
diagnostician.

275
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should get him
a job in radiology.

276
00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:30.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
He doesn't wanna be
a radiologist,
he wants to be a surgeon.

277
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.705 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what we hired him to be.

278
00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:35.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
That's what I worked
damn hard
to hire him to be.

279
00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a glorified orderly.

280
00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:39.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Every resident
does scut work.

281
00:14:39.753 --> 00:14:41.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you're treating him
like anybody else?

282
00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:43.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you?
-Yes. Yes, I am.

283
00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:45.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He more than earned
the right to be here.

284
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He has had to get past
people like you

285
00:14:47.511 --> 00:14:49.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and their prejudices
every step of the way.

286
00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-"Prejudices"?
-Yeah, prejudices.

287
00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:54.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Do you have any idea
how many patients he scared
the crap out of today?

288
00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:56.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How many wasted tests
he ordered?

289
00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So teach him.
-I'm doing that.

290
00:14:59.648 --> 00:15:01.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm teaching you both
that he doesn't belong.

291
00:15:04.194 --> 00:15:05.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

292
00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:08.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're gonna make me
pull rank, I will pull rank.

293
00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:09.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is my hospital.

294
00:15:10.492 --> 00:15:11.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's my team.

295
00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:14.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't tell me
how to run my team.

296
00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:27.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey. How are you doing?

297
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's the point
of sarcasm?

298
00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:33.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um… Uh, I…

299
00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:36.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I guess
sometimes it's a way of

300
00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:40.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
critiquing people in a way
that's funny, so they
don't feel quite so bad.

301
00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't it just lying?

302
00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Well, it's not lying,
because people know
you're lying.

303
00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:48.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not good at that.

305
00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We sell chocolate bars
every year

306
00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:55.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to pay for our class trip
to Mount Rushmore.

307
00:15:55.996 --> 00:15:56.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

308
00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:58.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But this year we're not going
to Mount Rushmore.

309
00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because Kenny can't go.
He's got cancer.

310
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
So, Samantha had the idea
that if he can't go,
none of us would go,

311
00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we all thought
that was a great idea.

If you don't do Dr. Melendez's
test right now,

418
00:23:10.972 --> 00:23:12.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will throw a rock
through your window.

419
00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:20.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I wouldn't want that.

420
00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:24.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go have a seat.

421
00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:26.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your results will
be ready in 15 minutes.

423
00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:38.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You got a minute?

424
00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:42.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I have a patient
lying in the OR
waiting for lab results,

425
00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:44.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
and I'm sitting here,
trying to figure out what
the hell I'm gonna do next

426
00:23:44.506 --> 00:23:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I don't like
any of my options. So…

427
00:23:46.883 --> 00:23:48.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, unfortunately,
it seems I do.

428
00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:50.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. We can talk
another time.

429
00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:51.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Glassman talked to you.

430
00:23:54.224 --> 00:23:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't have a problem
with an autistic doctor.

431
00:23:56.643 --> 00:23:58.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, you just have a problem
with one working for you.

432
00:23:58.728 --> 00:24:00.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? That's how you see me?

433
00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:02.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's not make this personal.

434
00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:03.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're accusing me
of prejudice.

435
00:24:04.901 --> 00:24:08.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I have a problem with a doctor
who has a problem
with communication.

436
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. Let's
make this personal.

437
00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:15.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] Who do you respect
at this hospital?

438
00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:18.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You and Glassman.

439
00:24:18.748 --> 00:24:19.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And who do you not respect?

440
00:24:23.837 --> 00:24:27.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
It doesn't bother you
that it looks like you're
on the wrong team?

441
00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:31.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the tumor hasn't invaded
into the arterial walls,

442
00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:33.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we could create
a plane of dissection.

443
00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, if it's a non-invasive
liposarcoma,

444
00:24:36.474 --> 00:24:38.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we can work it off
from the outside.

445
00:24:38.185 --> 00:24:41.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Blunt section, tissue forceps.
Peel it off, piece by piece.

446
00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:52.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a leiomyosarcoma.

447
00:24:54.034 --> 00:24:55.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

448
00:24:55.785 --> 00:24:57.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that sucks.

449
00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:59.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Shaun] Yes, it's sad.
-The surgery's impossible.

450
00:24:59.873 --> 00:25:02.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, might as well
wake her up.

451
00:25:03.251 --> 00:25:05.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let her know she has
three months to live.

452
00:25:05.462 --> 00:25:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Offer palliative care.

453
00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The surgery isn't impossible.

454
00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:18.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just very, very,
very difficult.

455
00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:21.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. In the sense that
we'll be operating blind.

456
00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:24.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, because the left kidney
is in the way.

457
00:25:24.105 --> 00:25:25.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The healthy left kidney.

458
00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:28.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Both kidneys
are healthy, Jared.
She only needs one.

459
00:25:28.568 --> 00:25:30.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Without the left one,
it's theoretically possible

460
00:25:30.737 --> 00:25:32.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to access the tumor
and remove it.

461
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're suggesting we cut out
a perfectly healthy organ

462
00:25:34.616 --> 00:25:36.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-just to get a better view?
-Yes.

463
00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:38.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But she might die anyway?
-Yes, quite probably.

464
00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:42.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to go.
I have a boil to lance.

465
00:25:44.167 --> 00:25:45.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[door opens]

466
00:25:46.586 --> 00:25:48.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, that's a brilliant,

467
00:25:49.589 --> 00:25:51.466 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:84.67% 
very, very, very terrible idea.

468
00:25:54.594 --> 00:25:56.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Close her up
and wake her up.

469
00:25:56.596 --> 00:25:59.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Who wants to join me
when I tell her she has
six weeks left to live?

470
00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:03.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is one possibility.

471
00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:09.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we remove the left kidney,
we might be able to get

472
00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
a good enough view
to successfully remove
the mass.

473
00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:15.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Take out a healthy kidney
to get a better view?
That's insane.

474
00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:19.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A good view is half
the battle in any operation.

475
00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:22.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Most likely outcome
is we'd be depriving

476
00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:24.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
her of what little time
she has left.

477
00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:25.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But if we succeed…

478
00:26:27.168 --> 00:26:30.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
You wanna do this
'cause it's exciting.
You wanna be a hero.

479
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:32.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if you fail,
this woman dies.

480
00:26:32.924 --> 00:26:34.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She misses
her son's wedding.

481
00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:37.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that's
the issue, isn't it?

482
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You promised
this woman she'll be okay.

483
00:26:49.232 --> 00:26:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
She had to do the surgery.
I might as well
tell her good things.

484
00:26:52.652 --> 00:26:55.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
[Dr. Melendez] The reason
we don't make patients
promises isn't just for legal.

485
00:26:56.031 --> 00:26:58.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Jared's right,
your judgment
is compromised.

486
00:26:58.491 --> 00:27:00.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I still think…
-But you're not objective.

487
00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:01.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who the hell is?

488
00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:05.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We should at least
wake her up,

489
00:27:05.373 --> 00:27:07.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
explain what we found,
what we're hoping to do,

490
00:27:08.251 --> 00:27:09.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and get a new consent.

491
00:27:09.627 --> 00:27:12.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
What we're hoping to do
is exactly what you told her
we were going to do.

492
00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:14.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remove that tumor.

493
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:17.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
The only thing we'd be
explaining is why you
undersold the risks.

494
00:27:18.678 --> 00:27:19.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're doing the surgery.

495
00:27:20.722 --> 00:27:22.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Jared, you're
my new number two.

496
00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:38.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dr. Mendelez] Mayos.
-[nurse] Mayos.

497
00:27:42.786 --> 00:27:45.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Going to open the fascia
and expose the kidney.

498
00:27:45.455 --> 00:27:47.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You clamp the renal hilum.
-[Jared] Clamp.

499
00:27:47.582 --> 00:27:48.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[nurse] Clamp.

500
00:27:54.964 --> 00:27:58.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
[Claire] We just cut off
the blood supply
to a perfectly healthy kidney.

501
00:27:58.385 --> 00:27:59.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dr. Melendez] If we needed
color commentary,

502
00:27:59.803 --> 00:28:01.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would have hired
Jeff Van Gundy.

503
00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:11.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shaun, I believe
you've met Trevor.

504
00:28:11.981 --> 00:28:13.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, I sent him home.

505
00:28:14.067 --> 00:28:16.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, well, he didn't go home.

506
00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:20.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
He actually came
to the president
of the hospital instead.

507
00:28:20.698 --> 00:28:22.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
He said you sent him home
even though
you thought he was sick.

508
00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:24.452 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I specifically never said that.

509
00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:25.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I made sure not to say that.

510
00:28:25.578 --> 00:28:27.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. No. What the hell
does that mean?

511
00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What does that mean, Shaun?

512
00:28:28.581 --> 00:28:30.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Am I healthy?
-Probably.

513
00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:32.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're a doctor,
you're supposed to know.

514
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
No, we're not.
Nobody knows
anything for sure.

515
00:28:34.504 --> 00:28:36.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anybody could drop dead

516
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Who is this guy? Am I…
Am I gonna have
a heart attack?

00:28:40.844 --> 00:28:44.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Shaun has some
difficulty with certain
social interactions…

00:28:44.889 --> 00:28:47.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
-But if he says…
-I don't give a crap
what he says.

519
00:28:47.434 --> 00:28:49.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Am I healthy?

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I've reviewed your chart
and I can say

Shaun, people
need reassurance.

00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:15.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I told him

I was very clear.

00:29:15.795 --> 00:29:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
With your words.
Your actions said something
completely different.

527
00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:21.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
No, they didn't.

00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:26.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you reassure someone,
they have to receive it.

529
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:30.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to gauge whether
they actually are reassured.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
It's not really a lie.
If you say that

00:29:42.489 --> 00:29:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that he's safe to go home.

00:29:47.827 --> 00:29:49.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:13.853 --> 00:30:16.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's a lot of tests

00:30:38.127 --> 00:30:40.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:46.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:51.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

552
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dr. Melendez] Yes, it is.

553
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

554
00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

555
00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:03.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:08.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00%

00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:22.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:28.237 --> 00:32:30.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:32.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

571
00:32:42.585 --> 00:32:44.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I think he'd be upset

00:32:51.344 --> 00:32:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:12.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
