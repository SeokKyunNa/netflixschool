Okay, you need to take the rest
of the day off.

207
00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:51.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dr. Melendez
said that, too. Why?

208
00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:54.422 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why? Because you just
experienced a traumatic event--

209
00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:56.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not my fault.
-I know that.

210
00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:01.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Avery has multiple injuries.
Dr. Melendez wants me
to monitor her.

211
00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:10.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dr. Lim.

212
00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I was out of line.
I shouldn't have
argued with you…

213
00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Primary closure went well.

214
00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
We'll extubate him
in a few hours to prevent
any further internal damage.

215
00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:21.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that's good.

216
00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:23.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is. And you're gonna
make sure he stays that way.

217
00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll be baby-sitting him
tonight in the ICU.

218
00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm… I'm not on call.

219
00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great, then you're available.

220
00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:32.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It should be a quiet night.

221
00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:33.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just want to keep an eye
on those vitals.

222
00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:35.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You never know
with trachea tears.

223
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can't one of the ICU nurses
do that?

224
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yep, but they didn't
lip off in my operating room.

225
00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And he'd better be breathing
in the morning.

226
00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:52.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Excuse me,
but why is Shaun
on the victim's case?

227
00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:55.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I assessed him
and he seemed
perfectly capable.

228
00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:56.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You assessed him?
What does that mean?

229
00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:59.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
You asked him
how he was feeling?
Are you psychic?

230
00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:01.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Do you have
an advanced degree
in psychology?

231
00:13:02.072 --> 00:13:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't know
what's going on in his head.

232
00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:07.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When I'm in surgery,

233
00:13:07.828 --> 00:13:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
my focus is on the person
whose guts are open
in front of me

234
00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:12.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
rather than the soul
of the person
standing across from me.

235
00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
And it seems that Shaun
doesn't let anything
impact his work.

236
00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:17.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So along with his
photographic memory,

237
00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:19.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm putting cold-hearted
in the plus column.

238
00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
[Dr. Mohan] Dr. Murphy,
do you understand
why you're here?

239
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. Dr. Glassman
said I had to talk to you.

240
00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:36.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After any doctor goes through
a potentially traumatic--

241
00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:39.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
You have to determine
if I am a medico-legal
liability to the hospital.

242
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:42.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. And, more importantly,

243
00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:46.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
it's an opportunity
to provide you
with emotional support.

244
00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:52.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How are you feeling?

245
00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:55.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't have apples.

246
00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll try to have some fruit
next time we meet.

247
00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:02.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good.

248
00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:06.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you regret anything
about this morning?

249
00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

250
00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:11.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
After bad things happen,

251
00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:13.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's perfectly normal
to replay the events,

252
00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
wishing you'd
done things differently.

253
00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:18.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It already happened.
I can't do things differently.

254
00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is talking about this
upsetting you?

255
00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you thinking about
right now?

256
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Systemic inflammatory
response syndrome.

257
00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:40.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dr. Melendez]
Surgery went well.

258
00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:42.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
After a serious trauma
like this,
the body can develop

259
00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:45.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a self-destructive
inflammatory reaction.

260
00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:48.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kidneys, liver, lungs, heart.

261
00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Any, or all of them,
can start to shut down.

262
00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:52.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll be giving her
anti-inflammatories

263
00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:55.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
and monitoring her closely,
but the next 24 hours
are critical.

264
00:14:55.769 --> 00:14:57.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. Thanks.
Just get her through this.

265
00:14:58.022 --> 00:14:59.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whatever you gotta do.

266
00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:00.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, well,
I need consent forms

267
00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:02.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
from your girlfriend's
next of kin.

268
00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:05.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
If you could please
get her family in here
as quickly as possible.

269
00:15:09.783 --> 00:15:10.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't.

270
00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:17.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't even know
her last name.

271
00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:20.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was our first date,
we met on a dating app.

272
00:15:20.544 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
We were going hiking,
so she wasn't carrying
a purse or ID.

273
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, then you really
don't need to be here.

274
00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:31.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Someone out there
cares about her.

275
00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:35.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If she dies, I want them
to know someone was with her.

276
00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:40.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll have social work
try to locate her family.

277
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stay as long as you want.

278
00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:58.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks clean,
dry, and healthy.

279
00:15:58.582 --> 00:15:59.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My neck is killing me.

280
00:16:02.836 --> 00:16:04.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long have you been using?

281
00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:06.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[exhales] What's that
got to do with anything?

282
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you've likely built up
a tolerance to pain meds.

283
00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:11.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
And now that you really
need them, they aren't
there for you.

284
00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:12.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why I need fentanyl,

285
00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
100 micrograms.
Are you gonna help me or not?

286
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wouldn't be helping.

287
00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The worst thing I could do
for you is feed your habit.

288
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:20.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[scoffs]

289
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

290
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:23.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You saw my tattoo.

291
00:16:24.733 --> 00:16:25.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

292
00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:27.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now you're punishing me.

293
00:16:27.569 --> 00:16:29.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
-You want this to hurt.
-I am treating you
professionally--

294
00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:31.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
If you were treating me
professionally, I wouldn't
be in so much pain.

295
00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:33.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm sorry, but I won't--
-Just give me the damn drugs!

296
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on!

297
00:16:51.593 --> 00:16:56.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Melendez thinks that he's okay
being on Avery's case.
I don't.

298
00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dr. Melendez may be right.

299
00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
That case seems to be
Shaun's primary focus
right now.

300
00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:03.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Maybe his condition
is a blessing
in this situation.

301
00:17:03.772 --> 00:17:04.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Maybe"?

302
00:17:04.898 --> 00:17:06.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or obsessing over
Avery's health

303
00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:08.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
could be his only outlet
for a guilty conscience.

304
00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Watching her suffer
could just be worsening
those feelings.

305
00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:13.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So either it's a huge problem,
or it's not a problem at all.

306
00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is your
professional opinion?

307
00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:19.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Shaun has a very unique mind
and an incredibly
introverted nature.

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:24.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, thank you for that.

309
00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:28.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, but without
a lot more time with him,

310
00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:30.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that's the best I can offer.

311
00:17:38.807 --> 00:17:40.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did Lim expect me to do?

312
00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:41.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stand there and smile
while she called

313
00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:43.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
my medical judgment
into question?

314
00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:46.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your patient nearly died
waiting on that OR, right?

315
00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:47.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was bad.
What do you want me to do?

316
00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:49.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Tell her to back off.
-No.

317
00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:52.071 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He's a complete and utter--
-Not one of those nice racists?

318
00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:53.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I shouldn't have to be--
-Claire…

319
00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:55.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
here's what you have to do.

320
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shut up and do exactly
what Dr. Lim tells you to do.

321
00:17:58.035 --> 00:17:59.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But, it--

322
00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:02.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, sir.

323
00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe we could take turns.

324
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You keep an eye on my patient,
I keep an eye on yours.

325
00:18:18.138 --> 00:18:20.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-[sighs]

326
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:23.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Her creatinine is 1.6.

327
00:18:25.395 --> 00:18:27.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A mild bump in renal numbers
isn't surprising

328
00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
after all her trauma.

329
00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:36.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This morning must
have been crazy.

330
00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:38.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you okay?

331
00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:43.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
This morning,
my neighbor Lea came over
and ate my apple.

332
00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:46.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's too bad.

333
00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:48.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, it was my last one.

334
00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:50.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was upset with Armen,
our landlord.

335
00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:54.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She plays her music very loud.
I gave her some advice.

336
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
It seemed to anger her
because she left
without saying goodbye.

337
00:18:59.054 --> 00:19:01.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you think
you did something wrong?

338
00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:03.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it was good advice.

339
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shaun, sometimes
a woman wants advice,

340
00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and sometimes
she just wants support.

341
00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:14.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How can I tell which one
Lea wants?

342
00:19:16.738 --> 00:19:17.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Err on the side of support.

343
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:19.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's not helpful.
-Yes, it is.

344
00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:22.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dr. Browne,
you're being summoned.

345
00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:24.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[inhales deeply]

346
00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:26.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

347
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:31.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About time.

348
00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All your struggling,
you've pulled out your IV.

349
00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:41.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Aren't nurses usually supposed
to do this kind of crap?

350
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They let you go to med school,

351
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:48.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they don't trust you
with any real responsibility.

352
00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:52.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
There must be
a competent doctor
tucked around here somewhere

353
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:54.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who can tell someone
I need more than aspirin.

354
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-"Competent"?
-Yeah. You know what I mean.

355
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Imhotep was the father
of modern medicine.
An Egyptian.

356
00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:05.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah? Good for your people.

357
00:20:07.956 --> 00:20:09.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I'm willing to bet
there's even been
a couple of others

358
00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:11.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
over the last 3,000 years.

359
00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:13.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But guess what?
On average,

360
00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:16.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you look at most great
technological advancements,

361
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
you'll find a proud
Northern European
holding the patent.

362
00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
[scoffs] That's what
you were trying to do
this morning?

363
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:25.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Get the patent on stealing
30 bucks from the corner store
for a drug fix?

364
00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:28.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't like drug addicts,
do you?

365
00:20:31.521 --> 00:20:32.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a lot of people
I don't like.

366
00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:40.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Thieves, racists,
violent punks.
But I'll treat 'em.

367
00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was your momma a drug addict?

368
00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:47.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

369
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the beauty of cliches,
is they're true so often.

370
00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:53.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't know
anything about me.

371
00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:55.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't go to college.

372
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I didn't have
no affirmative action
to get me in, but you did.

373
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:02.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
All because some
bleeding-heart liberal
in the dean's office

374
00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:05.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
teared up reading your essay
about your crack-whore momma.

375
00:21:05.555 --> 00:21:06.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[tightens strap]
-[winces] What the hell?

376
00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:11.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[scoffs]

377
00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:13.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess
we're all violent punks.

378
00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:33.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All you had to do
was give him your wallet.

379
00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:51.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Her urine output is low.

380
00:21:52.352 --> 00:21:54.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Whoa! Whoa!
What are you doing?
Get away from her!

381
00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:56.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, hey! You can't be in here
shoving my doctors around.

382
00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me? He's the…

383
00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:01.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

384
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She needs dialysis.
Her kidneys are failing fast.

385
00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:08.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the first stage
of total organ failure.

386
00:22:13.957 --> 00:22:15.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[machine beeping rapidly]

387
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Shaun] We removed two liters
of excess fluid with dialysis,

388
00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:21.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but she's getting worse.

389
00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:22.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fluid's building up
in her chest.

390
00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:24.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's in pulmonary
failure, too.

391
00:22:24.718 --> 00:22:26.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Draining the fluid
in her pleural space

392
00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:28.096 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:84.67% 
would reduce airway resistance.

393
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Let's prep her
for a thoracentesis.

394
00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're gonna have to work fast.

395
00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:34.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll prep the evac drain.

396
00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:36.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I'm gonna need you
to put that needle
right between--

397
00:22:36.313 --> 00:22:37.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sixth and seventh rib.

398
00:22:46.239 --> 00:22:48.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
-Wait. You're gonna
let him do it?
-Shut up.

399
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Right, careful.
Don't put the needle in
too deep.

400
00:22:50.368 --> 00:22:52.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We don't wanna give her--
-Pneumothorax.

401
00:22:54.122 --> 00:22:55.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, you're in.

402
00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now let me see
what I can pull out…

403
00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:04.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And, hopefully,
she settles down.

404
00:23:19.981 --> 00:23:21.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
CO2's down
and O2's climbing.

405
00:23:24.319 --> 00:23:26.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can manage her kidneys
and her lungs,

406
00:23:26.113 --> 00:23:28.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
but the last stop
in multiple organ failure
would be her heart.

407
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Watch her
ventilation pressures
like a hawk.

408
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:34.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Push cardio-protective meds,
and page me
if anything changes.

409
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:38.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think you're being her hero?

410
00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:42.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Fact is, you hardly
know her. And you don't
know him at all.

411
00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:45.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go home.

412
00:23:52.055 --> 00:23:53.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[knock at door]

00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:24.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:25.422 --> 00:24:26.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is some apology.

423
00:24:27.465 --> 00:24:28.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:29.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You really don't see
the problem here?

00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:31.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

426
00:24:33.096 --> 00:24:37.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Right now,
you are confronting me

00:24:38.351 --> 00:24:39.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.272 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:84.67%

429
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I have dealt with men
undermining my authority

00:24:49.362 --> 00:24:50.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We shouldn't do it

00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:52.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:54.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
like you would

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:09.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00%

I'm sorry, can I have a minute?

440
00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:19.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shaun?

441
00:25:20.435 --> 00:25:21.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

442
00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:28.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shaun, there's no need
to get defensive, okay?

443
00:25:28.985 --> 00:25:30.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you wanna sit down?
-No, thank you.

444
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:36.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I want you to tell me again
exactly what happened
this morning.

445
00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:38.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told you exactly
what happened this morning.

446
00:25:38.578 --> 00:25:42.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Yes, but people have told you
that it's your fault,
haven't they?

447
00:25:42.582 --> 00:25:45.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My actions and the shooting
were associative incidents.

448
00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:47.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is not
a causal relationship.

449
00:25:48.004 --> 00:25:50.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I paced and she got shot,
but pacing doesn't
cause shootings.

450
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:53.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Otherwise, every time
someone paced a shooting
would soon follow.

451
00:25:53.927 --> 00:25:55.553 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, that's a very good point.

452
00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:03.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
When someone has a gun
and it's a dangerous
situation, right?

453
00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:07.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
You don't wanna
upset the situation,
you don't wanna make it worse.

454
00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:11.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think
this is my fault, too?

455
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. No.
It was the shoot… [scoffs]

456
00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:16.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] It was
the shooter's fault,

457
00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:19.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but your actions may have
contributed to it.

458
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, Shaun, wait a second.
Wait a second.

459
00:26:22.289 --> 00:26:25.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I know your behavior
is not completely
in your control,

460
00:26:25.875 --> 00:26:29.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
but I also know
it's not completely
out of your control. Is it?

461
00:26:30.547 --> 00:26:32.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, yes, maybe it is
a little bit your fault.

462
00:26:34.801 --> 00:26:37.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And definitely… mine.

465
00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:44.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's right,
I wasn't there.

466
00:26:47.814 --> 00:26:49.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can we sit down, please?
Just for a second.

467
00:26:57.365 --> 00:27:01.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shaun, I convinced myself
that everything was fine,

468
00:27:01.202 --> 00:27:03.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

469
00:27:03.413 --> 00:27:04.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's great.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:09.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:11.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You need guidance.

473
00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:14.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Much more than I can give you.

00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:22.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:27:22.265 --> 00:27:24.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm supposed to be
watching her like a hawk.

476
00:27:46.664 --> 00:27:47.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's my fault.

477
00:27:52.587 --> 00:27:53.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't like her.

478
00:27:54.214 --> 00:27:56.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
didn't look…

480
00:28:00.303 --> 00:28:01.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know, I…

481
00:28:08.603 --> 00:28:12.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I mean, I wanted
to blow her off,
so I said I forgot water.

482
00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:15.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to the store,

00:28:15.485 --> 00:28:17.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then I'd pretend
that I forgot my wallet.

484
00:28:17.237 --> 00:28:18.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I knew she didn't have
her purse, so…

486
00:28:22.992 --> 00:28:24.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, no harm, no foul.

487
00:28:29.249 --> 00:28:30.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was there because of me.

488
00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:36.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:40.969 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:50.895 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:79.33%

a two-point drop

00:29:52.832 --> 00:29:53.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:55.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00%

that means we'd have to
open her back up.

another operation.

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:07.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:07.722 --> 00:30:10.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00%

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
If I'm right, there could be
no more blood to pump.
She'll be dead.

00:30:18.441 --> 00:30:20.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We should prepare

00:30:20.193 --> 00:30:21.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:25.907 --> 00:30:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:52.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
It must be hidden underneath

00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:54.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00%

00:30:55.061 --> 00:30:57.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00%

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:06.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
