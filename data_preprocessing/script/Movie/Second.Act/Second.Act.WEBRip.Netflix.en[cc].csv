00:01:21.963,00:01:25.713,"You know, you're not supposed to buy your own birthday breakfast."
00:01:27.963,00:01:29.796,-I hate birthdays. But I love you though. -Yeah.
00:01:33.755,00:01:34.713,So you want some?
00:01:35.255,00:01:38.046,"-Yeah, when I get out of the shower, baby. -I wasn't talking about that."
00:01:38.921,00:01:39.921,"-Oh, no? -No."
00:01:40.005,00:01:43.255,"That's not what you're talking about? Oh, happy birthday to me."
00:01:43.338,00:01:44.171,Uh-huh.
00:01:50.713,00:01:51.796,That's a hot outfit.
00:01:52.296,00:01:53.588,I need to look professional.
00:01:53.671,00:01:55.671,"Relax, okay? Everyone there loves you."
00:01:56.213,00:01:58.421,I just... I don't know if I can do this.
00:01:59.255,00:02:01.921,Every manager at our company has a college degree.
00:02:02.421,00:02:04.005,"Yeah, well, I'd argue that..."
00:02:04.546,00:02:07.713,"fifteen years' experience is worth, what, ten degrees?"
00:02:08.796,00:02:10.463,-Not to these people. -Oh.
00:02:11.630,00:02:12.713,But thank you.
00:02:24.463,00:02:25.755,"I need you today, Abuela."
00:02:25.838,00:02:29.130,"Just remember that they need you more than you need them, okay?"
00:02:29.213,00:02:31.630,"-Look, I'm just trying to stay focused. -Yeah."
00:02:31.713,00:02:33.005,Keep my eye on the ball.
00:02:33.588,00:02:35.755,"-Did you just sports-metaphor me? -Oh, God."
00:02:35.838,00:02:38.296,"Hey, you know, just take it one game at a time."
00:02:38.380,00:02:39.838,What if Weiskopf doesn't like me?
00:02:39.921,00:02:42.171,"Well, it's a game of inches. You've got to give them 110%."
00:02:42.255,00:02:43.130,I'm ignoring you.
00:02:43.213,00:02:48.380,"Do you like, It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Weiskopf? Or is that-- -Too ass-kissy. -Yeah, okay."
00:02:49.755,00:02:51.171,"I have to get this, Trey."
00:02:51.255,00:02:52.130,"Hey, look..."
00:02:53.255,00:02:55.630,The only thing with a prayer of stopping you...
00:02:56.130,00:02:57.255,is you.
00:03:00.046,00:03:01.088,I'm going to be late.
00:03:01.171,00:03:02.130,Okay.
00:03:02.630,00:03:03.963,-Knock 'em dead. -Okay.
00:03:05.421,00:03:07.588,"Your ass looks great in those jeans, by the way."
00:03:07.671,00:03:10.171,"Again? You know, I'm not a piece of meat."
00:03:10.255,00:03:12.005,"Okay, but we're gonna have to make this quick."
00:03:12.088,00:03:12.921,Bye!
00:03:13.005,00:03:14.588,Okay. Bye!
00:03:29.088,00:03:31.546,to show you what we've been doing at Value Shop 151.
00:03:34.046,00:03:37.796,Ozone Park Value Shop outsells its nearest competition twice over.
00:03:38.380,00:03:39.380,Let me show you why.
00:03:39.880,00:03:41.671,Welcome to our online store.
00:03:42.213,00:03:50.380,"My best friend, Joan Volpintesta, fellow employee, sends her son Dilly into the store with his cell phone to hold up every single cut of sirloin for her beef braciola."
00:03:51.338,00:03:52.338,That's when it hit me.
00:03:52.421,00:03:54.088,It's a live feed. Interesting.
00:03:54.171,00:03:59.380,"Yes. From home, our subscribers can pick a certain cut of salmon, the third lemon from the back."
00:03:59.880,00:04:01.005,Anything they want.
00:04:01.088,00:04:04.130,"They shop before noon, we deliver by six, 20-mile radius."
00:04:04.213,00:04:06.213,"Expands our community, expands our volume."
00:04:06.296,00:04:08.005,And expands our profits nicely.
00:04:08.505,00:04:10.505,And this is where it all began.
00:04:11.088,00:04:12.546,-Monday Moms? -Yes.
00:04:12.630,00:04:14.130,This was all Maya's idea.
00:04:14.880,00:04:16.213,Meet the aforementioned Joan.
00:04:16.713,00:04:18.171,"-Hello. -Well, hello."
00:04:18.255,00:04:31.963,Hi. I'm a mom of two kids and I have a deadbeat ex and I was sharing my woes with some other moms when Maya smartly suggested that we start a weekly bitch fest-- -Social club. -A social club.
00:04:32.046,00:04:34.838,"You know, cater to Monday moms, or dads..."
00:04:35.421,00:04:36.921,and it just grew from there.
00:04:37.005,00:04:39.505,"Wait, are you talking customers or staff?"
00:04:41.546,00:04:44.671,Suzi DaVinci. I call it Value Shop therapy.
00:04:44.755,00:04:45.880,We're like shopping friends.
00:04:45.963,00:04:56.088,"We swap stories, coupons-- I don't even know what to say, except Arthur's going to be extremely fortunate to have you as a first lieutenant."
00:04:56.171,00:04:58.755,So I'm going to leave you alone to get to know each other better.
00:05:02.630,00:05:04.046,"Mr. Weiskopf, can I have a minute?"
00:05:04.130,00:05:05.046,You can have two.
00:05:05.546,00:05:06.463,Thank you.
00:05:07.380,00:05:09.005,I prepared for this meeting for weeks.
00:05:09.088,00:05:10.255,And you did great.
00:05:12.755,00:05:13.630,I put...
00:05:14.130,00:05:21.880,"fifteen years of my life into this store, and after becoming assistant manager six years ago, sales have increased at a record pace."
00:05:22.546,00:05:24.713,"Look, I mean no disrespect, but..."
00:05:25.421,00:05:28.005,what do you know about this store or the people who shop here?
00:05:28.088,00:05:29.880,I specialize in team-building.
00:05:29.963,00:05:31.546,Arthur got his MBA from Duke.
00:05:31.630,00:05:34.088,I think you'll find he's the best man for the job.
00:05:34.171,00:05:35.046,"No, sir."
00:05:36.546,00:05:37.421,I am.
00:05:38.213,00:05:39.921,"Where did you go to college, dear?"
00:05:42.255,00:05:43.505,I have my GED.
00:05:43.588,00:05:49.963,"I respect that, I do, but we have minimum job requirements in place for a reason."
00:05:50.046,00:05:51.213,And what is that reason?
00:05:51.296,00:05:55.296,I want you to know how much we value you and your loyalty.
00:05:58.463,00:06:01.463,You would think management would want someone from sales in that position.
00:06:01.546,00:06:03.088,"Okay, perspective."
00:06:03.588,00:06:07.421,"You have a great boyfriend, Trey, who is ring shopping as we speak."
00:06:07.505,00:06:08.463,He's what?
00:06:08.963,00:06:09.838,Shit!
00:06:12.005,00:06:13.296,Why would you tell me that?
00:06:13.380,00:06:15.046,"I said, Shit, so obviously I know..."
00:06:15.130,00:06:18.296,"Anyway, it shouldn't be a surprise. You guys have been together for five years."
00:06:18.380,00:06:19.421,It's not about...
00:06:21.130,00:06:21.963,He wants kids.
00:06:22.046,00:06:23.421,And that's a bad thing because...?
00:06:23.505,00:06:25.380,I'm not having this conversation right now.
00:06:27.921,00:06:29.671,"Okay, how do I say this nicely?"
00:06:30.171,00:06:31.171,"Okay, I can't."
00:06:31.255,00:06:32.921,"How about this? Tonight, you get messed up."
00:06:33.005,00:06:35.671,"After the party, you get knocked up. You can use my guest bedroom."
00:06:35.755,00:06:36.713,What party?
00:06:36.796,00:06:37.963,Shit!
00:06:40.255,00:06:41.796,"-What party? -Okay, do me a favor."
00:06:41.880,00:06:43.880,Act surprised. Can you do that for me?
00:06:43.963,00:06:45.171,Don't be selfish.
00:06:45.255,00:06:46.671,Nobody likes a selfish girl.
00:07:13.588,00:07:14.421,Hey!
00:07:17.671,00:07:18.505,Kill the music.
00:07:19.005,00:07:23.380,I want... I want to say a couple of things about the birthday girl.
00:07:23.463,00:07:24.296,Oh!
00:07:24.380,00:07:28.463,"So, back when I was coaching Babe Ruth League-- -Oh, no. No. -Yeah."
00:07:28.546,00:07:31.755,There was this Friday night game at Pensacola Field...
00:07:32.505,00:07:37.296,and this kid goes down on a cold third strike.
00:07:37.921,00:07:39.380,And out of nowhere...
00:07:39.880,00:07:44.255,there's this shrieking coming from the stands.
00:07:44.338,00:07:45.380,Ow!
00:07:46.588,00:07:50.838,Some crazy lady is just all over the ump.
00:07:51.421,00:07:55.546,So I turn around to get a look at this wacko.
00:07:57.671,00:07:58.505,And bam.
00:07:59.463,00:08:00.546,There she is.
00:08:01.921,00:08:06.671,"Beautiful, brazen, and completely on fire."
00:08:07.838,00:08:09.588,And anyone... Any...
00:08:11.005,00:08:12.463,corporate dickhead...
00:08:13.630,00:08:17.671,who doesn't appreciate just how amazing this woman is...
00:08:18.755,00:08:19.588,"Well, babe..."
00:08:20.546,00:08:21.588,as they say...
00:08:28.005,00:08:29.546,"-Come on, dance with me. -Oh, gosh, no."
00:08:29.630,00:08:30.671,-Come on. -Really?
00:08:30.755,00:08:31.671,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:31.755,00:08:33.630,"-Right now? -Right now, in front of everyone."
00:08:49.255,00:08:50.630,Beautiful. You are.
00:08:50.713,00:08:51.963,You're not so bad.
00:08:52.046,00:08:52.963,"Oh, okay."
00:09:03.505,00:09:06.046,"I mean, cleaning up on my own birthday. Nice."
00:09:06.130,00:09:08.088,"Well, that's what real friends do."
00:09:08.963,00:09:10.588,I'm gonna have my birthday here every year.
00:09:10.671,00:09:11.505,Shut up.
00:09:12.338,00:09:13.296,Are you okay?
00:09:14.755,00:09:16.505,"-Screw 'em. -Yeah, screw 'em."
00:09:17.005,00:09:17.838,Who?
00:09:18.880,00:09:19.755,Them.
00:09:20.630,00:09:23.296,The educated people in their...
00:09:24.171,00:09:27.796,"fancy houses, who name their kids after fruit and..."
00:09:29.088,00:09:30.546,climb Kilimanjaro.
00:09:30.630,00:09:33.213,"Yes, screw them."
00:09:33.296,00:09:35.046,"I mean, doesn't it make you crazy?"
00:09:35.130,00:09:40.630,"That just because you didn't get a degree when you were 18, you don't qualify for a job when you're freaking 40?"
00:09:40.713,00:09:43.505,"Oh, my God. First of all, who said..."
00:09:44.630,00:09:45.838,life is fair?
00:09:47.005,00:09:47.838,Right?
00:09:47.921,00:09:52.713,"Come on, your godson going to Stanford on a Google scholarship..."
00:09:52.796,00:09:55.046,"That kind of helps to even things out, don't you think?"
00:09:55.546,00:09:57.630,"Come on, Maya, it's a title. It doesn't define you."
00:09:57.713,00:10:02.130,Says the woman who can't say her son's name without mentioning that he's going to Stanford.
00:10:02.213,00:10:03.588,This is true. Okay. All right.
00:10:03.671,00:10:05.338,I mean... And you should!
00:10:05.421,00:10:06.338,You should.
00:10:06.838,00:10:07.671,It's amazing.
00:10:08.713,00:10:09.546,But I...
00:10:12.255,00:10:13.130,I don't know.
00:10:14.255,00:10:16.171,"I just thought, by now, I..."
00:10:20.046,00:10:20.880,I don't know.
00:10:21.630,00:10:23.171,Is this about Sarah?
00:10:25.296,00:10:28.255,"Okay, when are you going to forgive yourself for that?"
00:10:29.213,00:10:30.130,Really.
00:10:30.213,00:10:33.296,"Well, maybe I just need to stop banging my head up against the wall."
00:10:33.880,00:10:37.963,"The world tells you enough times this is who you are, maybe it's time to start believing it."
00:10:38.046,00:10:39.796,There are tons of other jobs out there.
00:10:39.880,00:10:42.213,"Oh, my God, would you stop eavesdropping?"
00:10:42.296,00:10:43.421,I'm not eavesdropping.
00:10:43.505,00:10:45.755,And now he brought cake so I can't be mad at him.
00:10:46.255,00:10:47.213,Okay.
00:10:47.921,00:10:48.755,One wish...
00:10:49.255,00:10:50.171,on your birthday.
00:10:52.213,00:10:53.130,Okay.
00:10:54.755,00:10:56.088,I wish...
00:10:59.338,00:11:00.213,I wish...
00:11:01.130,00:11:04.171,that we lived in a world where street smarts equal book smarts.
00:11:08.255,00:11:09.130,I wish...
00:11:09.755,00:11:10.838,"Hey, hey."
00:11:11.921,00:11:13.338,"You gave it your best, right?"
00:11:14.130,00:11:15.130,-That's right. -Yeah.
00:11:16.463,00:11:17.296,Come on.
00:11:17.921,00:11:19.005,Let's blow that out.
00:11:19.088,00:11:20.213,We know you know how to blow.
00:11:21.255,00:11:23.463,That's the word on the street. I don't... I'm not...
00:11:23.546,00:11:25.463,"-Please shut up. Just shut up. -Well, blow it out."
00:11:25.546,00:11:27.088,You can't stay here all night.
00:11:28.630,00:11:32.338,I've always liked the idea of round tables.
00:11:32.963,00:11:37.463,"You know, as a boy, my favorite stories were the ones where King..."
00:11:38.171,00:11:39.130,Miss Davilla...
00:11:40.046,00:11:40.921,a minute.
00:11:47.713,00:11:49.755,"Look, I'm aware that you wanted this position."
00:11:49.838,00:11:52.463,"And what's more, I sincerely believe that you deserved it."
00:11:52.546,00:11:55.963,"Your ideas, while rough, still have merit."
00:11:56.046,00:11:56.921,I mean...
00:11:57.005,00:11:58.005,What's rough about them?
00:11:58.088,00:12:04.796,"But when you roll your eyes, Miss Davilla, you trivialize a team-building exercise, and that divides us."
00:12:05.296,00:12:06.380,You're my right hand.
00:12:06.838,00:12:08.463,We're all at the same table.
00:12:08.963,00:12:10.046,Yeah?
00:12:10.338,00:12:18.046,"As I was saying, I'd like us to think of ourselves as knights, each with our own wisdom and fiefdoms."
00:12:18.130,00:12:19.005,So...
00:12:19.630,00:12:20.921,Sir Vondell Jones...
00:12:21.630,00:12:25.005,you will be our Knight of Legumes.
00:12:25.088,00:12:28.671,"And Sir Alex Gibbeon, you are the Marquis of Meat."
00:12:28.755,00:12:30.463,What the hell is a legume?
00:12:30.546,00:12:32.088,"And, Shaniqua Harris..."
00:12:32.588,00:12:35.380,you are the Knight of Feminine Hygiene.
00:12:35.463,00:12:36.880,I'm menopausal.
00:12:38.171,00:12:39.171,Apparently I deserve this.
00:12:39.255,00:12:41.088,"Hey, some lady called for you."
00:12:41.171,00:12:43.463,Something about a job interview from F&amp;C.
00:12:44.380,00:12:46.171,-Franklin &amp; Clarke? -I don't know.
00:12:47.171,00:12:49.296,"The ones who make half the stuff on Aisles 7, 8, and 11."
00:12:49.380,00:12:50.421,"Oh, okay."
00:12:52.255,00:12:53.588,I didn't apply for a job there.
00:12:53.671,00:12:56.713,"All right, you pulled it out of me. Remember your birthday wish?"
00:12:58.296,00:13:01.171,"-What, Dilly? -He used your legal name, don't worry."
00:13:01.255,00:13:03.130,He put you up for some jobs. He did.
00:13:03.213,00:13:04.130,I didn't ask him to.
00:13:04.213,00:13:05.463,Okay. All right.
00:13:05.546,00:13:11.088,"Well, you know what, you can either grow some balls or spend the rest of your life with Lord Bag of Dicks."
00:13:14.380,00:13:16.755,"here, let's fight, I'll teach you some swordplay."
00:13:16.838,00:13:17.755,The knight...
00:14:09.130,00:14:10.171,Maya Davilla.
00:14:10.671,00:14:12.713,I'm sorry. It's under Maria Vargas.
00:14:12.796,00:14:14.296,I got a call from...
00:14:14.380,00:14:16.213,Your interview's on the 59th floor.
00:14:32.046,00:14:33.755,"-Hi, I'm-- -Miss Vargas."
00:14:33.838,00:14:35.380,"Yes, he's been expecting you."
00:14:36.838,00:14:37.713,He?
00:14:39.505,00:14:40.588,Miss Vargas is here.
00:14:42.130,00:14:43.171,Hi.
00:14:44.796,00:14:45.838,I'm Anderson Clarke.
00:14:47.046,00:14:48.755,Clarke? As in Franklin &amp; Clarke?
00:14:48.838,00:14:52.171,"My grandfather wanted it to be Clarke &amp; Franklin, but he lost the coin toss."
00:14:52.255,00:14:54.880,"Still steams my clams. Come on in. Come on in, Maria."
00:14:54.963,00:14:56.963,"Please, call me Maya."
00:14:57.046,00:14:59.255,"Oh, well, then, call me Anderson."
00:15:00.130,00:15:02.171,"Are you, um...?"
00:15:02.630,00:15:04.005,"I mean, you're the head of..."
00:15:05.255,00:15:09.088,-I just assumed Human Resources was-- -Your resume interests me.
00:15:09.713,00:15:10.630,You come from sales?
00:15:11.130,00:15:12.005,Fifteen years.
00:15:13.546,00:15:15.421,"I'm sorry, what is this position for?"
00:15:15.505,00:15:19.546,I've often thought that sales should have a greater voice in product development.
00:15:19.630,00:15:20.713,I couldn't agree more.
00:15:20.796,00:15:22.588,The market's only getting more competitive.
00:15:22.671,00:15:24.338,And consumers are only getting smarter.
00:15:24.421,00:15:25.588,"Oh, yes, they are."
00:15:26.838,00:15:28.171,You live here in the city?
00:15:29.046,00:15:30.380,I'm in between apartments.
00:15:30.880,00:15:31.713,Family?
00:15:32.588,00:15:33.463,Just me.
00:15:34.880,00:15:37.755,"Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't know you had a meeting."
00:15:37.838,00:15:41.171,"Uh, Maya, this is Zoe, one of our vice-presidents."
00:15:41.255,00:15:42.130,-Hello. -Hi.
00:15:42.213,00:15:44.213,-Maya works for Sam Weiskopf. -Indirectly.
00:15:44.963,00:15:46.921,So what are you guys talking about?
00:15:47.005,00:15:49.838,I was thinking of bringing Maya on for a consultancy.
00:15:49.921,00:15:50.796,You were?
00:15:53.088,00:15:56.463,"Uh, you must have a lot of experience in product development."
00:15:56.546,00:15:59.380,"Oh, I'm sure she's well-versed in the efficacy of our products."
00:15:59.463,00:16:00.380,Maya?
00:16:02.880,00:16:04.713,"Uh, you-- you want me to?"
00:16:07.046,00:16:08.005,"Well, okay."
00:16:09.838,00:16:12.588,"Uh, well, off the top of my head, um..."
00:16:13.546,00:16:18.005,"Your Rainforest Mountain shampoo is excellent, although we only stock the regular version."
00:16:18.171,00:16:19.005,Um...
00:16:19.088,00:16:21.213,Your men's shaving gel really moves.
00:16:21.755,00:16:23.255,But your skincare line is...
00:16:30.005,00:16:37.880,"You launched your Avocado Jojoba line last spring and we only sold 1,353 units, which is about 70% under the normal range."
00:16:37.963,00:16:40.755,-And that's just off the top of your head? -Can I talk to you in private?
00:16:40.838,00:16:43.130,"Just a second. Why do you think they didn't sell, Maya?"
00:16:43.463,00:16:44.380,Well...
00:16:45.046,00:16:47.713,your organic line isn't really organic.
00:16:48.921,00:16:50.005,Are you kidding me?
00:16:53.255,00:16:55.630,"Look, I don't want to insult anyone, okay? And I..."
00:16:56.380,00:16:58.005,I realize that my...
00:16:58.588,00:17:01.963,"credentials aren't typically-- Oh, you are right about that."
00:17:03.713,00:17:06.255,"Harvard undergrad, magna cum laude."
00:17:06.338,00:17:08.921,"Then there's your philanthropy, all the work with the Peace Corps."
00:17:09.005,00:17:11.630,"And, of course, you have got to see the Facebook page."
00:17:11.713,00:17:12.796,Her Facebook page?
00:17:12.880,00:17:13.755,My Facebook page?
00:17:17.421,00:17:18.338,Is that right?
00:17:18.963,00:17:19.921,"Well, Zoe?"
00:17:20.546,00:17:21.421,What do you think?
00:17:21.505,00:17:22.755,I think I've seen enough.
00:17:24.130,00:17:25.463,"Thank you for coming in, Maya."
00:17:25.546,00:17:26.796,"Yeah, okay."
00:17:26.880,00:17:27.796,Thank you.
00:17:39.213,00:17:40.380,Shit!
00:17:45.546,00:17:46.505,Hey.
00:17:47.171,00:17:48.088,Uh-oh.
00:17:48.630,00:17:50.088,She doesn't look happy.
00:17:50.171,00:17:52.046,-She doesn't look happy. -I'm not happy.
00:17:52.130,00:17:55.338,"-They didn't like you? -No, they thought I was very accomplished."
00:17:55.421,00:17:59.671,"Given my MBA and my stint in the Peace Corps, who can blame them?"
00:17:59.755,00:18:00.588,Peace Corps?
00:18:00.671,00:18:01.963,"Yeah, it's all right there..."
00:18:02.755,00:18:04.130,on my Facebook page.
00:18:04.213,00:18:08.338,But you're not on Facebo-- Dilly!
00:18:09.796,00:18:11.505,Do not move.
00:18:12.046,00:18:14.255,Did you create a Facebook page for Maya?
00:18:14.338,00:18:16.046,And do not lie.
00:18:16.130,00:18:18.171,"-Yes. -Okay, that was easy."
00:18:18.796,00:18:20.130,But it wasn't just Facebook.
00:18:22.546,00:18:23.796,This is a work of art.
00:18:23.880,00:18:26.005,"I mean, I gave you a completely new identity."
00:18:26.088,00:18:29.588,You've got your own Wix site and it's got social and corporate.
00:18:29.671,00:18:31.130,"-What? -Why, Dill?"
00:18:31.630,00:18:32.588,For your birthday.
00:18:32.671,00:18:36.130,"I mean, you said you wanted to be fancy, so I just Cinderella'd your ass."
00:18:36.213,00:18:37.088,Ow.
00:18:37.588,00:18:41.213,"I was going to use your porn name, but you don't even use your legal name anymore."
00:18:41.296,00:18:43.046,-So-- -My porn name?
00:18:45.296,00:18:46.505,Mine's Fluffy Valley.
00:18:46.588,00:18:48.713,"Okay, so it's a whole new you."
00:18:48.796,00:18:50.671,"But it's still you, because it's your real name."
00:18:50.755,00:18:54.213,"I've got everything. I've got your school records, employment history."
00:18:54.296,00:18:55.713,The FBI couldn't debunk this.
00:18:55.796,00:18:57.296,So it's basically real.
00:18:57.380,00:18:59.255,Except it's bullshit.
00:18:59.338,00:19:00.880,"Yeah, it's bullshit!"
00:19:00.963,00:19:02.171,Out!
00:19:02.755,00:19:05.630,It doesn't matter because I'm not getting the job anyway.
00:19:07.588,00:19:10.171,"And, look, next time I start making birthday wishes, just..."
00:19:11.130,00:19:12.130,hit me over the head.
00:19:15.838,00:19:17.713,-It's my porn name. -Don't say bulbous.
00:19:20.546,00:19:22.505,Don't curse in front of your godmother.
00:19:23.130,00:19:24.046,Little asshole.
00:19:25.463,00:19:31.338,"Okay, all those in favor of renaming to Morning Masticators, raise your hand."
00:19:31.421,00:19:32.838,"Nice and high, so I can count."
00:19:32.921,00:19:35.671,-It just sounds like mast-- -It means eating. Okay?
00:19:35.755,00:19:38.171,Calling it Moms is sexist against men.
00:19:39.213,00:19:40.588,"You're a little stupid, aren't you?"
00:19:45.505,00:19:48.046,"Remember, you're supposed to be my right hand."
00:19:50.921,00:19:53.463,I bet you he uses that right hand a lot.
00:19:54.546,00:19:56.255,Tell me what mastication means.
00:19:59.630,00:20:01.046,"Uh, I..."
00:20:01.630,00:20:02.588,Thank you.
00:20:05.463,00:20:07.088,"No, absolutely, I will."
00:20:08.963,00:20:09.880,What?
00:20:10.421,00:20:11.588,That was F&amp;C.
00:20:13.046,00:20:14.171,They want to hire me.
00:20:14.505,00:20:17.630,Shut up! I thought that skinny bitch kicked you out of her office.
00:20:17.713,00:20:18.546,She did.
00:20:18.630,00:20:21.088,"I mean, I basically trashed their entire skincare line."
00:20:21.171,00:20:23.796,Maybe that was a test to see if you were a straight shooter.
00:20:23.880,00:20:26.088,The lie got you in the door.
00:20:26.755,00:20:28.963,"But you got the job, baby."
00:20:29.046,00:20:31.380,Come on. You can do this.
00:20:38.338,00:20:39.546,"Hey, who's the champ?"
00:20:40.296,00:20:41.338,-What? -You're the champ.
00:20:41.963,00:20:43.046,"Come on, who's the champ?"
00:20:43.713,00:20:46.463,Who's the champ? Wake up. Who's the champ? Let's go.
00:20:46.546,00:20:47.880,-Who's the champ? -I'm the champ?
00:20:47.963,00:20:48.838,You're the champ.
00:20:48.921,00:20:50.921,-Come on. -Stop doing that to me.
00:20:56.046,00:20:57.463,"Excuse me, Arthur..."
00:20:58.338,00:20:59.588,I've been thinking about...
00:21:00.338,00:21:02.463,all the things you've said this week.
00:21:02.838,00:21:03.671,Good.
00:21:04.421,00:21:06.046,And I don't think I can be your right hand.
00:21:06.921,00:21:07.921,Are you quitting?
00:21:09.921,00:21:10.921,Best of luck to you.
00:21:14.088,00:21:16.338,It's not easy getting a job for a woman your age.
00:21:16.421,00:21:18.130,-Oop! -Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
00:21:23.296,00:21:25.130,"Oh, she's about to fuck you up."
00:21:29.046,00:21:29.921,Watch me.
00:22:02.796,00:22:04.963,"Attaboy, Lucas! Nice turn."
00:22:05.463,00:22:06.380,Nice ass.
00:22:08.213,00:22:10.505,-Who are you talking about? -You know who I'm talking about.
00:22:11.755,00:22:14.380,The team's looking great. You guys are going all the way this year.
00:22:14.463,00:22:16.796,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll be happy if we make the tournament, but..."
00:22:17.380,00:22:18.463,a lot of good teams to beat.
00:22:18.546,00:22:20.713,They don't have the best assistant coach in the country.
00:22:20.796,00:22:22.213,I like your confidence.
00:22:22.296,00:22:24.255,I like your-- Ass. I know.
00:22:24.338,00:22:25.630,I was going to say smile.
00:22:28.338,00:22:31.130,"Hey, I have some great news I want to talk to you about."
00:22:32.171,00:22:33.130,Yeah?
00:22:33.213,00:22:37.421,"-Full Moon? -Yeah, let me finish up here and then I'll see you there at eight?"
00:22:37.505,00:22:38.796,-Perfect. -Okay.
00:22:49.921,00:22:53.213,"-I just, I can't believe you said yes. -I know!"
00:22:53.713,00:22:55.463,"I know, my head is still spinning."
00:22:55.546,00:22:57.630,"Yeah, but you're going to come clean, right?"
00:22:59.505,00:23:02.588,"Look, I admit that the way I got in was less than honest, but..."
00:23:04.046,00:23:05.380,what I did in that room...
00:23:06.630,00:23:07.713,I can do this.
00:23:09.130,00:23:11.296,"Okay. I'm happy for you, babe."
00:23:11.880,00:23:14.296,"Hey, maybe you take this offer..."
00:23:14.671,00:23:19.296,You tell him we need a couple weeks and we can go away and start a family.
00:23:19.963,00:23:22.005,"-This could be a really good thing. -Trey, I can't."
00:23:28.130,00:23:29.088,It's just...
00:23:30.046,00:23:31.088,not the right time.
00:23:32.796,00:23:35.255,Our timing never seems right.
00:23:36.505,00:23:37.546,Does it?
00:23:37.630,00:23:40.421,"I mean, we've been talking about this for three years."
00:23:41.546,00:23:42.380,I always...
00:23:43.588,00:23:45.921,thought we were heading to this.
00:23:46.880,00:23:48.546,"You know, I want..."
00:23:49.671,00:23:50.796,a family.
00:23:50.880,00:23:54.171,"Maya, I want kids and I want that with you."
00:23:54.671,00:23:56.005,We can even adopt.
00:23:56.588,00:23:57.546,"Oh, baby."
00:24:05.921,00:24:06.796,No.
00:24:09.755,00:24:12.255,It's obvious we want different things.
00:24:12.338,00:24:13.213,Trey...
00:24:14.838,00:24:16.505,We shouldn't do this anymore.
00:25:14.796,00:25:17.005,"Oh, oh, no. You look like Mrs. Doubtfire."
00:25:17.630,00:25:19.880,"I'm trying to look respectable, not too slutty."
00:25:19.963,00:25:21.505,"Oh, all right. Well, no problem there."
00:25:22.005,00:25:23.921,That outfit's like dick repellent.
00:25:24.588,00:25:26.213,"-What's dick repellent? -Okay, out."
00:25:26.713,00:25:29.130,What? You say bad shit all the time.
00:25:29.213,00:25:30.755,"Okay, you know what? Go brush your..."
00:25:31.380,00:25:32.880,fricking teeth. Goodbye.
00:25:32.963,00:25:34.338,That's not even a word!
00:25:34.421,00:25:37.880,"Hey, go with Plan Anything Other Than That."
00:25:38.421,00:25:39.255,And...
00:25:39.755,00:25:41.755,"wipe that face off your face, Missy Thing. Okay?"
00:25:43.546,00:25:45.671,All right. Don't say I didn't warn you.
00:25:57.171,00:25:58.588,-Maya! -No!
00:26:21.838,00:26:22.921,-That hurt my boob. -Did it?
00:26:23.505,00:26:25.546,-Yes. Now out of my way. -Where are you going?
00:26:25.630,00:26:27.713,No. Where are you going? No.
00:26:28.380,00:26:30.755,Come on! This is not eighth grade. Come on.
00:26:30.838,00:26:31.921,Come on.
00:26:33.130,00:26:34.796,What! What!
00:26:34.880,00:26:36.130,"Oh, you remember that part?"
00:26:36.213,00:26:37.088,That's right.
00:26:37.838,00:26:39.630,Uh-uh. Where's she going?
00:26:40.380,00:26:42.630,"Oh, my God, it doesn't work anymore!"
00:27:23.963,00:27:24.796,Hello.
00:27:24.880,00:27:28.005,"Hi. Ariana Ng, your probationary assistant."
00:27:28.505,00:27:29.963,"Oh. Okay, well..."
00:27:30.463,00:27:31.505,you can call me Maya.
00:27:31.588,00:27:32.880,"Yes, Maya'am."
00:27:32.963,00:27:34.005,Ma'am.
00:27:34.588,00:27:36.088,"Follow me, please."
00:27:36.671,00:27:40.546,"There you are. Hi. I'm Hildy Ostrander, your DE."
00:27:40.630,00:27:42.255,"Oh, hi. Nice to meet you, Hildy."
00:27:42.921,00:27:45.005,"-Sorry, DE? -Development Executive."
00:27:45.088,00:27:48.255,Miss Ostrander came to F&amp;C from Vassar via Pfizer.
00:27:48.338,00:27:52.296,"She also oversees the entire East Coast and is very single-- Oh, Ng, say less."
00:27:52.921,00:27:53.921,Right this way.
00:28:02.630,00:28:03.630,Wow.
00:28:04.338,00:28:07.921,"This is-- I know, we'll have the decorators right up so you can fix it."
00:28:08.005,00:28:09.588,This is really great.
00:28:10.171,00:28:11.463,Cancel the decorators.
00:28:11.546,00:28:15.213,Mr. Clarke's office sent down keys to one of our corporate apartments in the city.
00:28:15.296,00:28:17.046,-Ariana? -Yes.
00:28:17.546,00:28:18.505,I can't.
00:28:18.588,00:28:20.588,She's afraid of heights.
00:28:24.255,00:28:25.963,She was talking to me. Six years.
00:28:26.046,00:28:26.880,Great.
00:28:27.213,00:28:30.046,"Because I'm here to work my butt off, so any wisdom you can impart..."
00:28:30.130,00:28:32.505,Great. We'll start with the morning meeting.
00:28:34.046,00:28:38.421,"Development kicks off the new quarterly cycle today, so your timing's perfect."
00:28:38.505,00:28:39.546,"Uh, what cycle?"
00:28:39.630,00:28:43.505,"It was men's grooming, but they switched it to skincare at the last second."
00:28:44.338,00:28:45.296,You're kidding me.
00:28:45.380,00:28:48.380,I don't want this to sound like anything but constructive advice.
00:28:48.463,00:28:54.130,"We've never had a consultant in development before, so they're gonna be looking for any excuse to tear you apart."
00:28:55.546,00:28:56.630,That's comforting.
00:28:56.713,00:28:59.130,"That's Ron Ebsen, the other DE."
00:28:59.213,00:29:00.755,-He's cute. -He knows it.
00:29:00.838,00:29:03.505,He actually studied dance before he went to business school.
00:29:03.588,00:29:06.171,"He'll come over as soon as he... Yep, brace for impact."
00:29:06.255,00:29:07.463,-You must be Maya. -Hi.
00:29:07.546,00:29:10.546,Ron Ebsen. I've been lobbying for a consultant for a while now.
00:29:10.630,00:29:12.171,"You went to Wharton, right?"
00:29:12.255,00:29:13.463,"Yes, I did."
00:29:13.963,00:29:16.046,-Wharton. -And you had Professor Gumpart?
00:29:16.671,00:29:18.338,Of course. I love him.
00:29:18.838,00:29:19.671,Her.
00:29:20.421,00:29:21.838,"Yeah, not anymore."
00:29:21.921,00:29:23.296,"Oh, wow."
00:29:23.380,00:29:25.630,"Hang on, are you sure? Because she and I, we..."
00:29:26.213,00:29:27.546,"Oh, God."
00:29:27.630,00:29:28.880,"Good morning, everyone."
00:29:29.380,00:29:30.671,"Zoe, right?"
00:29:30.755,00:29:33.005,Yes. Vice-president of Global Skincare.
00:29:34.130,00:29:35.296,-Skincare? -Mm-hmm.
00:29:36.296,00:29:37.130,"Oh, boy."
00:29:37.213,00:29:44.005,Some of you have already heard our new mandate from on high to replace our existing moisture line with an organic alternative.
00:29:46.255,00:29:48.046,Apparently it needs to be more so.
00:29:48.130,00:29:49.338,By the end of the quarter?
00:29:49.755,00:29:50.880,That's not possible.
00:29:54.380,00:29:55.213,Just greener.
00:29:56.380,00:30:00.880,"From the shrieks of wild enthusiasm, I take it Zoe's just broken the news."
00:30:01.380,00:30:08.546,"Are you kidding me? He's old enough to be her-- No, no. I just wanted to drop by and formally introduce our new hire."
00:30:09.130,00:30:15.546,Maya Vargas is an extremely accomplished consultant and the new skincare direction was partially inspired by her feedback.
00:30:15.630,00:30:16.463,Maya?
00:30:22.463,00:30:25.380,"End of quarter is aggressive, but I think we're up to the challenge."
00:30:25.463,00:30:26.630,"Excellent. Thank you, Ron."
00:30:26.713,00:30:30.963,"We'll start brainstorming, though it might be helpful to hear Maya's game plan."
00:30:33.338,00:30:38.796,"-Sorry? -Yes. Maya, please, tell everyone where you think the existing skincare line falls short."
00:30:41.130,00:30:42.921,Okay. Um...
00:30:45.130,00:30:46.046,Respectfully...
00:30:48.421,00:30:55.171,"F&amp;C was skewered when they tried to convince people that Nutralis was a new hair-growth product when, basically, it was repackaged shampoo."
00:30:55.338,00:30:56.380,They felt scammed.
00:30:56.880,00:30:59.505,-So to repeat that pattern-- -It's not the same.
00:30:59.880,00:31:05.546,You can't say all natural on the front of a bottle and then have a whole list of chemicals on the back.
00:31:05.630,00:31:08.505,All comfortably within FDA guidelines.
00:31:08.588,00:31:12.296,People don't want to probably not get cancer from a skin cream.
00:31:12.380,00:31:17.171,That's ridiculous. Launching an entirely new product line is almost triple the cost of evolving an existing one.
00:31:17.255,00:31:20.046,"-I think people-- -Guys, we're all on the same team, okay?"
00:31:23.171,00:31:24.046,How about this?
00:31:24.130,00:31:29.755,Ron and I will thread the needle at profitably organicifying the current line.
00:31:30.380,00:31:35.296,"And Maya and Hildy can cook up something new, all green, within our profit margins."
00:31:35.380,00:31:36.255,"Oh, Christ."
00:31:36.796,00:31:38.005,You want to compete?
00:31:43.213,00:31:44.171,Okay.
00:31:45.005,00:31:45.963,You've got three months.
00:31:46.505,00:31:47.338,"And, uh..."
00:31:48.338,00:31:49.588,may the best woman win.
00:31:54.171,00:31:57.088,The first and most imperative step is landing Felix.
00:31:57.171,00:31:59.171,-Who's Felix? -Inventor of Vitalize.
00:31:59.255,00:32:00.505,"Oh, I love Vitalize."
00:32:00.588,00:32:02.171,"He's F&amp;C's chief chemist, the best."
00:32:02.255,00:32:04.296,"He's got a vision for the market, and the chemistry."
00:32:04.380,00:32:06.046,We cannot do this without Felix.
00:32:06.671,00:32:08.380,Great. Can we get him?
00:32:09.421,00:32:10.255,No.
00:32:12.796,00:32:16.505,Walt Benjamin is Felix's number two and an incredibly talented scientist.
00:32:17.046,00:32:18.463,I'm not going against Felix.
00:32:20.588,00:32:24.838,Alicia Zhou is our latest hire out of Cornell.
00:32:25.630,00:32:26.463,Yes.
00:32:26.546,00:32:27.546,Great!
00:32:29.838,00:32:31.588,This is going to be so exciting.
00:32:31.671,00:32:33.880,"No, it's not. That was sarcasm."
00:32:33.963,00:32:35.796,Did you not pick up on that? Or...
00:32:42.338,00:32:43.921,This guy was on Hildy's list?
00:32:44.005,00:32:46.255,We've gone through the list. This is my idea.
00:32:54.130,00:32:55.005,Stay!
00:32:57.630,00:33:00.921,So you went from MIT to developing cat food?
00:33:01.630,00:33:02.630,Maybe I like cats.
00:33:02.713,00:33:04.255,Or maybe Felix exiled him.
00:33:04.921,00:33:07.046,"Well, maybe Felix is an ass panda."
00:33:08.046,00:33:09.671,"Well, he teamed up with Zoe."
00:33:09.755,00:33:11.463,"Yeah, everyone's teamed up with Zoe."
00:33:12.046,00:33:13.046,Except you.
00:33:13.630,00:33:14.963,Is that because of Felix?
00:33:15.046,00:33:22.671,"Look, there are millions of words in the English language, but there is no combination that accurately describes the feeling I have of wanting to beat his ass with a chair."
00:33:22.755,00:33:25.005,"So, here's your chance to beat that panda ass."
00:33:26.921,00:33:27.838,I'm in.
00:33:29.338,00:33:30.171,Yay.
00:33:39.671,00:33:42.046,"Oh, my God! What the hell?"
00:33:43.255,00:33:47.380,"You know what? Screw the kid, I am moving in with you."
00:33:47.713,00:33:49.546,He could learn to hunt or something.
00:33:49.630,00:33:50.671,This is crazy.
00:33:50.755,00:33:52.671,All of this is insane.
00:33:52.755,00:33:53.713,Look at this!
00:33:54.213,00:33:56.921,"Oh, my God, you've got cards here."
00:33:57.505,00:34:00.046,"Bergdorf Goodman. Hello, lover."
00:34:00.130,00:34:02.296,Those are for product research and stuff.
00:34:02.380,00:34:05.088,The big companies give you that so you can keep up with everything.
00:34:05.171,00:34:06.838,"Oh, my God, look at this!"
00:34:06.921,00:34:08.213,Fifty levels of refrigerator.
00:34:11.130,00:34:12.796,"-Holy what? -Oh, yeah."
00:34:12.880,00:34:16.755,Otto got kicked out of school because he called his teacher a dunt.
00:34:17.338,00:34:19.755,"-A what? -A dumb-- -Oh, wow. -Yeah."
00:34:19.838,00:34:23.630,"So I am endeavoring to set a better example. Beer, dear."
00:34:23.921,00:34:25.171,-Good luck with that. -Yeah.
00:34:25.255,00:34:26.255,"Well, I'll need it."
00:34:26.338,00:34:28.130,Here you go. Cheers.
00:34:32.338,00:34:34.796,"Oh, my God. Look at all these drawers even."
00:34:36.963,00:34:37.796,Who?
00:34:38.630,00:34:39.796,"Oh, Trey?"
00:34:42.046,00:34:42.880,Um...
00:34:43.713,00:34:45.630,"Uh, I don't really want... I don't..."
00:34:45.713,00:34:47.296,You don't really what?
00:34:48.463,00:34:50.296,You know how it is. People...
00:34:51.046,00:34:55.005,hear that you guys broke up and he's a wounded fish and...
00:34:55.963,00:34:58.088,"you know, the sharks start circling."
00:34:59.088,00:35:00.421,It's only been a week.
00:35:00.505,00:35:01.671,What do you expect?
00:35:01.755,00:35:03.380,You never told him the truth.
00:35:03.463,00:35:06.296,And me telling him the truth was suddenly going to make everything okay?
00:35:06.380,00:35:10.255,"No, you're right, it's better to lug your past around like a cross."
00:35:12.671,00:35:13.630,Maya...
00:35:14.421,00:35:17.130,You were 17 years old when you gave the kid up.
00:35:17.213,00:35:18.880,You were a kid yourself.
00:35:20.046,00:35:21.671,You did the right thing.
00:35:22.421,00:35:23.880,"Oh, come on."
00:35:23.963,00:35:26.296,Now that I've bummed you out about Trey...
00:35:26.380,00:35:28.380,"No, come on, I don't want to do that."
00:35:30.838,00:35:32.171,I don't know what I'm doing here.
00:35:32.255,00:35:35.213,You don't know what you're doing here? I'll tell you what you're gonna do.
00:35:35.296,00:35:36.213,You're gonna...
00:35:36.963,00:35:40.046,"take these cards here, you're gonna dress the part."
00:35:40.130,00:35:43.005,You're gonna buy yourself those fancy shoes with the red bottoms.
00:35:43.088,00:35:44.088,"All right, you know what?"
00:35:44.171,00:35:47.796,"As your friend, I'm gonna take these off your hands. Thank you."
00:35:47.880,00:35:51.338,"-Don't you dare. -No, I'm gonna take 'em, 'cause you don't seem to be appreciative of it."
00:35:51.421,00:35:53.421,-No! -Okay. And then I'm gonna take this.
00:35:53.505,00:35:54.588,"Oh, it's a two-parter."
00:35:54.671,00:35:56.713,-I'm gonna take these and I'm gonna go. -No!
00:36:01.296,00:36:03.255,"-Oh, my God. -This is crazy."
00:36:03.338,00:36:05.546,Come on. Let's show them what Queens can do.
00:36:06.046,00:36:07.296,Holding!
00:36:07.838,00:36:09.838,"One for you, two for me."
00:36:09.921,00:36:11.796,We can't spend all of it.
00:36:11.880,00:36:15.380,"Okay, do you know what? Gift cards are like horses."
00:36:15.463,00:36:18.005,They are meant to be ridden hard.
00:36:18.088,00:36:20.088,Now get your head in the game. There you go.
00:36:20.588,00:36:22.130,And I'm gonna go ahead and try this on.
00:36:22.213,00:36:23.171,You can't buy that.
00:36:23.255,00:36:25.213,"I'm not buying it. You are, bitch. Thank you."
00:36:34.463,00:36:38.713,"Okay. First thing we need to do, outline a goal for our product."
00:36:40.088,00:36:41.671,Has to be 100% organic.
00:36:42.171,00:36:43.921,It has to be profitable.
00:36:44.005,00:36:47.338,It has to fill a hole in the marketplace.
00:36:47.421,00:36:49.296,"Uh, it needs a wow factor."
00:36:49.380,00:36:51.421,Why are you smushed against the door?
00:36:51.505,00:36:53.338,"Uh, none of your business."
00:36:55.880,00:36:56.880,To be young.
00:36:56.963,00:36:58.088,To be thin.
00:36:58.171,00:37:00.296,"Uh, to work underground."
00:37:00.380,00:37:01.588,To be loved.
00:37:01.671,00:37:09.338,"Well, great. All we need to do is invent a product that makes people feel young, thin, lovable, and..."
00:37:09.921,00:37:11.130,subterranean.
00:37:22.921,00:37:26.671,"These are all the day creams, night creams. La Mer, Valmont, Hauschka."
00:37:26.755,00:37:29.963,"Dove, TRESemmé, Supergoop-- Ariana, say less."
00:37:30.046,00:37:31.505,Everything that is relevant.
00:37:35.130,00:37:37.130,...turized. Moisturized.
00:37:37.213,00:37:43.463,"Anyway, the first step is to have Research put together a data package that shows us the top sellers in each sector."
00:37:43.755,00:37:44.588,Why?
00:37:44.671,00:37:47.296,It's standard procedure in launching any new line.
00:37:48.171,00:37:50.088,"Well, I think we should be in the stores."
00:37:50.171,00:37:54.046,"You know, talking to the managers, looking at the sell-throughs, the rates of return."
00:37:54.130,00:37:58.796,"I mean, if we're gonna find a hole in the market, then we have to find a hole in the market."
00:37:58.880,00:38:02.005,That's gonna eat up a lot of time and we only have ten weeks.
00:38:03.296,00:38:05.671,"-Mr. Clarke, what a surprise. -Hello, Hildy."
00:38:05.755,00:38:07.505,-Brushing up on the competition? -Yes.
00:38:07.588,00:38:08.630,What can we do for you?
00:38:08.713,00:38:14.921,"Well, these guys already know it, but I like to torture my employees once in a while and I thought maybe you'd like to join us out at the yacht club."
00:38:15.630,00:38:16.546,Yacht club?
00:38:16.630,00:38:20.421,"Since you coxed on the club team at Harvard, I thought you could show us a thing or two."
00:38:23.838,00:38:24.671,Sure.
00:38:40.421,00:38:43.338,"I mean, I got into science so I wouldn't have to go outdoors."
00:38:43.421,00:38:44.421,"Suck it up, ladies."
00:38:44.505,00:38:46.088,"Now, this is what I call team-building."
00:38:46.671,00:38:48.296,Zoe rowed lightweight for Princeton.
00:38:48.380,00:38:50.505,Never could beat you Crimson when she was there.
00:38:50.588,00:38:52.171,Said you guys always had their number.
00:38:52.255,00:38:55.546,We'll see if we still have some of that old Crimson magic.
00:38:57.005,00:38:58.255,On the square!
00:38:59.838,00:39:00.921,On the square!
00:39:01.005,00:39:02.338,Sit ready!
00:39:02.421,00:39:03.630,Shit's ready!
00:39:04.046,00:39:05.296,"Damn right, it is."
00:39:05.463,00:39:07.463,"Hey, shall we power 20 right from the start?"
00:39:08.213,00:39:09.630,"Yes, of course."
00:39:09.713,00:39:10.755,Attention.
00:39:12.880,00:39:14.380,-Power 20!
00:39:22.546,00:39:23.630,Five.
00:39:23.713,00:39:24.755,Row!
00:39:24.838,00:39:25.671,Six.
00:39:25.755,00:39:26.838,Row!
00:39:26.921,00:39:27.963,Seven.
00:39:28.046,00:39:30.130,Row your boat!
00:39:30.213,00:39:31.463,Eight.
00:39:33.588,00:39:34.671,Yeah!
00:39:34.755,00:39:35.838,"Go, go, go!"
00:39:35.921,00:39:37.296,"-Oh, my God. -My God."
00:39:37.380,00:39:38.255,I lost my olive.
00:39:38.338,00:39:40.046,"-I'm so sorry. -No, don't get it."
00:39:41.671,00:39:42.588,"Damn it, Zoe."
00:39:42.671,00:39:43.671,I've got this.
00:39:44.380,00:39:45.380,I've got this!
00:39:48.755,00:39:50.296,I so did not have that.
00:39:50.380,00:39:52.255,It's okay. We've had worse.
00:39:52.338,00:39:53.713,That was epic.
00:39:54.296,00:39:55.171,Where to begin?
00:39:55.838,00:39:57.380,I can think of a couple of places.
00:39:57.963,00:40:02.088,It's funny. I thought I heard pull port as something different.
00:40:02.588,00:40:03.421,Really?
00:40:03.505,00:40:04.796,Pull port!
00:40:06.046,00:40:07.255,Pulled pork?
00:40:07.338,00:40:09.505,-Pulled pork? -Right.
00:40:09.588,00:40:11.296,-Right? -Yes!
00:40:12.046,00:40:12.963,No!
00:40:13.046,00:40:16.088,-The other right. The other right! -Look out!
00:40:18.880,00:40:22.921,"I just want to apologize-- I just want to say one thing, all right?"
00:40:24.171,00:40:26.588,That was...
00:40:35.130,00:40:36.588,I'll see you guys tomorrow.
00:40:37.088,00:40:41.171,I hope somebody videotaped that 'cause that was some crazy shit.
00:40:43.630,00:40:44.796,"Well, that worked out."
00:40:45.380,00:40:46.213,"See you, Maya."
00:40:46.963,00:40:47.838,Okay.
00:40:48.630,00:40:51.088,"First, we have to work for his daughter. Now we get this one."
00:40:51.671,00:40:53.130,There's something bullshit about her.
00:40:56.380,00:40:57.630,-What? -Hmm?
00:40:58.130,00:40:59.338,Your dad is...
00:41:00.046,00:41:00.921,unique.
00:41:01.630,00:41:04.255,He's competitive to the point of occasional insanity.
00:41:04.838,00:41:06.213,But it's made him who he is.
00:41:08.921,00:41:10.130,You worry about him.
00:41:11.546,00:41:13.421,I worry about some of his decisions...
00:41:15.463,00:41:17.005,since my mother passed away.
00:41:19.546,00:41:20.505,I'm sorry.
00:41:21.796,00:41:25.046,Six years and he hasn't been on a date or a single vacation.
00:41:25.838,00:41:28.755,Although I finally talked him into putting the apartment on Zillow.
00:41:30.796,00:41:37.296,"He is always on me about having more of a life outside of work, and yet he can't see the same about himself."
00:41:38.421,00:41:41.213,"He's a dad. That's what they do, right?"
00:41:43.338,00:41:45.838,"I lost both my parents when I was young, so..."
00:41:46.421,00:41:48.005,my grandmother raised me until...
00:41:48.630,00:41:51.588,"she died and then I bounced around foster care, so I wouldn't know."
00:41:52.088,00:41:54.088,Is that why you never married or had kids?
00:41:57.088,00:41:58.338,Something like that.
00:42:00.838,00:42:04.380,"Well, now that we've analyzed each other, I've got a big day tomorrow."
00:42:04.463,00:42:06.130,First shot at initial prototypes.
00:42:06.630,00:42:07.630,How are you guys coming?
00:42:07.713,00:42:08.838,We're close.
00:42:09.380,00:42:10.213,Hm.
00:42:10.921,00:42:11.838,Very close.
00:42:13.546,00:42:16.171,"What the hell? Oh, my God, it smells awful!"
00:42:16.255,00:42:19.713,"Yeah, that's because it's 100% organic, as ordered."
00:42:26.630,00:42:29.796,"Excuse me, can I ask you some questions about your daily skincare routine?"
00:42:30.505,00:42:31.588,"All right, okay."
00:42:32.630,00:42:35.880,Hi. Hi. What do you look for in a sunblock?
00:42:36.380,00:42:40.171,"Excuse me, do you have time-- Do you have the time?"
00:42:40.255,00:42:41.338,As a woman who wears...
00:42:41.838,00:42:43.088,all the make-up...
00:42:43.630,00:42:45.630,do you have any particular favorites?
00:42:47.421,00:42:49.088,Hello. Hi.
00:42:49.171,00:42:50.088,Hi.
00:42:52.838,00:42:57.005,It's cold out here. Glad you have all that makeup on to keep you warm.
00:42:57.963,00:43:00.088,The paraben chemicals are what make it smell better.
00:43:00.671,00:43:01.755,No!
00:43:01.838,00:43:03.880,"We can't do that, right?"
00:43:03.963,00:43:06.713,And what do we do to make it a nicer color than vomit-green?
00:43:07.213,00:43:08.796,Methoxycinnamate?
00:43:08.880,00:43:10.630,"Dumb it down for me, all right?"
00:43:10.713,00:43:14.005,How do we get rid of the chemicals and still make it look and smell nice?
00:43:14.088,00:43:15.671,We have to find the ingredients in nature.
00:43:15.755,00:43:17.755,"Good. All right then, start searching."
00:43:18.213,00:43:19.296,"Do you have a minute, sir?"
00:43:19.380,00:43:20.463,"Oh, come on!"
00:43:22.713,00:43:23.671,"Oh, my God!"
00:43:24.255,00:43:25.380,Are you okay?
00:43:25.463,00:43:26.963,That dickhead just kept walking.
00:43:27.880,00:43:30.505,Do you have mirrors at home?
00:43:30.588,00:43:32.921,And do you look at them before you leave?
00:43:33.421,00:43:38.046,"Wow, you have really soft skin. What kind of moisturizer do you use?"
00:43:38.130,00:43:39.130,-Really? -Yeah.
00:43:41.130,00:43:42.296,"Yes, er..."
00:43:42.921,00:43:47.796,How do I verify if someone who says they went to Harvard actually graduated from there?
00:43:48.630,00:43:51.171,Do you have the name of the person and the year of graduation?
00:43:51.671,00:43:54.213,"Yes. Maria Vargas, class of '96."
00:43:54.963,00:43:56.255,Vargas...
00:43:56.838,00:43:59.005,"Oh, yes, she graduated with honors."
00:43:59.088,00:44:01.255,"Wow, magna cum laude."
00:44:02.588,00:44:03.588,Excuse me?
00:44:04.171,00:44:08.505,"No, sorry, Admissions gets really excited when we ding a scholarship candidate."
00:44:10.130,00:44:10.963,Er...
00:44:11.463,00:44:13.463,Okay. Thank you very much.
00:44:13.546,00:44:14.380,No problem.
00:44:22.005,00:44:25.838,"-Dude! Oh, God, did you see that? -Damn it!"
00:44:30.796,00:44:31.963,"Yes, is Mr. Taylor in?"
00:44:32.046,00:44:34.713,I have a quick question about a reference on a former employee.
00:44:34.796,00:44:37.880,Mr. Taylor's away until the 21st. I can have him return.
00:44:38.921,00:44:40.546,I would appreciate that. Thank you.
00:44:40.630,00:44:43.213,"I'm really proud to be here with them, be a part of it, you know?"
00:44:48.671,00:44:50.505,Woo! That was really cold!
00:44:59.338,00:45:00.171,Hello.
00:45:00.838,00:45:02.505,-What's this? -Research.
00:45:03.338,00:45:04.713,You did all this in the field?
00:45:04.796,00:45:05.671,"God, no."
00:45:05.755,00:45:08.796,We have wasted six weeks talking to wackadoos from store to store.
00:45:08.880,00:45:10.338,I ordered this from downstairs.
00:45:10.921,00:45:12.213,That's not how we're doing this.
00:45:12.296,00:45:14.005,And yet it's how it's done.
00:45:14.088,00:45:18.338,"Wow, 120,000 responses, but no real consensus."
00:45:18.421,00:45:19.546,Which is exactly my point.
00:45:19.630,00:45:21.755,People are idiots. They don't know what they want.
00:45:21.838,00:45:26.088,They want us to tell them what they want so they can pick the prettiest bottle and get on with their lives.
00:45:26.171,00:45:28.380,"Maya, can I talk to you for a second?"
00:45:29.130,00:45:30.088,"Uh, yeah."
00:45:35.046,00:45:38.421,"So, we are looking at taking on a new Chinese distributor."
00:45:38.880,00:45:42.130,Their CEO is in town and wants to meet me and Ron for dinner this Thursday.
00:45:42.505,00:45:44.921,His English is sketchy at best.
00:45:45.005,00:45:45.963,Dad thought...
00:45:47.046,00:45:48.421,you could help us out.
00:45:49.005,00:45:50.005,Okay.
00:45:50.421,00:45:56.255,"Our go-to translator is on his honeymoon, and the only employee we have who speaks Mandarin is..."
00:45:58.046,00:45:59.296,-Me? -Yeah.
00:46:01.713,00:46:03.088,-Okay. -Great.
00:46:03.171,00:46:04.421,-Great. -Thursday.
00:46:04.505,00:46:05.796,-Yep. -Okay.
00:46:06.921,00:46:09.713,"Oh, my God, you are so buttfricked!"
00:46:09.796,00:46:11.796,"-It's not funny, Joan. -It is."
00:46:11.880,00:46:14.130,I almost killed people in a boat race.
00:46:14.213,00:46:16.963,Now I'm gonna murder Mandarin. I don't speak Chinese.
00:46:17.046,00:46:20.421,"All right, so you do a lot of nodding. I mean, men don't listen to us anyway."
00:46:20.505,00:46:21.546,I'm serious.
00:46:23.255,00:46:24.546,I just got an idea.
00:46:24.630,00:46:26.630,Our cat's veterinarian.
00:46:26.713,00:46:29.380,He's the nicest guy in the world and he speaks Mandarin.
00:46:29.463,00:46:30.755,And how does that help me?
00:46:30.838,00:46:33.588,"Well, if this works, you owe me big time."
00:46:47.005,00:46:51.171,"familiarize you with our process, sir."
00:46:53.880,00:46:56.005,Have you ever traveled extensively in China?
00:47:00.630,00:47:01.671,You say...
00:47:07.838,00:47:08.713,You say...
00:47:13.963,00:47:16.213,check its scrotum.
00:47:24.546,00:47:26.463,leaving everybody else out of the conversation.
00:47:26.546,00:47:29.505,I'm sure that your English is much better than my Mandarin.
00:47:29.588,00:47:31.921,I suspect it might be.
00:47:32.005,00:47:36.505,We would love to schedule a tour for you and your colleagues to visit our facilities firsthand.
00:47:36.588,00:47:40.796,"But we would have to wait for the deal to be closed, due to the proprietary nature of R&amp;D."
00:47:40.880,00:47:46.421,"As long as there is a signed non-disclosure agreement, I feel perfectly comfortable allowing Mr. Jiang to tour."
00:47:46.505,00:47:49.838,"You may not be aware, Zoe, but that directly contradicts company policy."
00:47:50.255,00:47:52.463,But I'm sure Mr. Jiang can understand that.
00:47:57.630,00:47:59.546,What's his problem?
00:48:00.213,00:48:01.088,Oh.
00:48:14.296,00:48:19.046,"And thank you, Zoe. I will gladly sign the NDA to tour your facilities."
00:48:22.255,00:48:23.671,Ron didn't seem too happy.
00:48:23.755,00:48:26.838,"Well, Ron is one of the reasons I hate this job sometimes."
00:48:27.838,00:48:29.838,"So, how is your project coming?"
00:48:30.671,00:48:31.588,Honestly?
00:48:32.296,00:48:33.171,Slow.
00:48:33.255,00:48:34.796,I should have kept my big mouth shut.
00:48:34.880,00:48:37.671,"Yeah, 100% organic is tough."
00:48:37.880,00:48:39.463,I took a run at it a few years ago.
00:48:43.213,00:48:47.713,"You know, I still have some research over at my dad's place."
00:48:47.796,00:48:52.046,"If you don't mind helping me search for it, it might save you a few headaches."
00:48:53.671,00:48:55.963,Thanks. That would be really helpful.
00:48:56.046,00:48:59.588,"Yeah, well, it's the least I can do for you making Ron look like a dick."
00:49:01.588,00:49:02.421,I'll see ya.
00:49:08.338,00:49:09.213,"What's up, Pops?"
00:49:09.296,00:49:11.130,I'm heading out to meet Maya at the apartment.
00:49:11.213,00:49:13.088,"Actually, that's why I wanted to see you."
00:49:13.171,00:49:15.213,Uh-oh. Sounds serious.
00:49:15.296,00:49:16.838,"Would you close the door, sweetheart?"
00:49:19.255,00:49:20.130,Okay.
00:49:37.505,00:49:39.130,-Hey. -Hey.
00:49:43.338,00:49:45.671,"-Wow, when's he moving? -Next month."
00:49:46.046,00:49:49.130,"My apartment's so tiny, he lets me keep a lot of my junk here."
00:49:50.546,00:49:52.713,This place is... huge.
00:49:53.255,00:49:54.213,You grew up here?
00:49:54.838,00:49:55.880,Most of my life.
00:50:06.755,00:50:07.630,Is that your mom?
00:50:08.463,00:50:09.671,-Mm-hmm. -She's pretty.
00:50:12.921,00:50:14.755,-She was blonde? -Yeah.
00:50:15.546,00:50:16.546,I was adopted.
00:50:18.630,00:50:20.255,Let's get you that research.
00:50:29.046,00:50:29.921,And I mean...
00:50:30.380,00:50:31.463,everything.
00:50:31.546,00:50:32.505,"Oh, my goodness."
00:50:33.130,00:50:34.213,Could you be any cuter?
00:50:36.921,00:50:38.713,This is all the early stuff.
00:50:41.338,00:50:42.380,First haircut.
00:50:45.338,00:50:46.171,First tooth.
00:50:52.296,00:50:53.296,Ah.
00:50:53.546,00:50:54.671,It's my first blanket.
00:50:56.005,00:50:57.380,It was from my birth mother.
00:51:00.546,00:51:01.755,It came with this.
00:51:03.838,00:51:05.671,"It says, Wherever you go..."
00:51:20.921,00:51:22.088,"Oh, my..."
00:51:23.463,00:51:25.296,-How? -My dad.
00:51:25.921,00:51:27.588,I'm completely pissed at him.
00:51:27.671,00:51:31.088,"You know, for years after my mom died, I tried to find you."
00:51:31.671,00:51:36.338,"But it was just a series of dead ends, so I sort of gave up."
00:51:38.046,00:51:39.755,But apparently he didn't.
00:51:41.630,00:51:43.046,That was a good decision.
00:51:44.421,00:51:47.671,"God, I used to always wonder what your voice sounded like."
00:51:48.338,00:51:49.255,"Oh, my God."
00:51:56.046,00:51:57.755,Did you ever search for me?
00:52:00.963,00:52:03.713,"You know, the adoption agency advised me not to."
00:52:03.796,00:52:04.838,They said...
00:52:05.921,00:52:08.630,that you were with a good family and that I shouldn't.
00:52:11.755,00:52:14.255,"But every time I saw a little girl, I would think..."
00:52:16.505,00:52:18.755,Is that what Sarah looks like now?
00:52:19.630,00:52:21.046,You called me Sarah?
00:52:22.255,00:52:26.755,So I would have been Sarah Rosalina de la Santa Cruz Davilla Vargas?
00:52:28.505,00:52:29.630,You see why I shortened it?
00:52:29.713,00:52:30.630,Yeah.
00:52:32.171,00:52:33.046,Oh...
00:52:41.046,00:52:42.255,What about my father?
00:52:44.255,00:52:45.380,I met him at a party.
00:52:48.421,00:52:49.588,Does he know about me?
00:52:52.588,00:52:54.880,I never even knew his last name.
00:52:56.046,00:52:59.505,But he was the most beautiful boy I'd ever seen.
00:53:00.546,00:53:01.380,He was?
00:53:02.338,00:53:03.880,And very sweet.
00:53:09.921,00:53:12.213,But I was... 16.
00:53:13.046,00:53:14.880,And basically on my own and...
00:53:17.338,00:53:18.713,But I knew you had to be born.
00:53:19.630,00:53:21.046,It wasn't even a question.
00:53:28.005,00:53:31.338,"They were going to take you away, you know, put you back in the system."
00:53:31.921,00:53:33.755,And I just couldn't let that happen.
00:53:39.046,00:53:41.671,you can't help but grow up with a sense of rejection.
00:53:44.838,00:53:46.505,Is something wrong with me?
00:53:47.296,00:53:48.130,Exactly.
00:53:54.755,00:53:56.630,I would have done anything to keep you.
00:53:59.296,00:54:05.005,"You know, I know we haven't exactly gotten along, but I really admire you."
00:54:05.796,00:54:07.963,Just everything you've accomplished.
00:54:09.546,00:54:11.630,You're kind of who I want to be when I grow up.
00:54:32.130,00:54:33.005,You okay?
00:54:35.213,00:54:39.296,"Well, I took out the really good stuff, 'cause I am still going to kick your ass."
00:54:40.713,00:54:44.421,"By the way, I don't think we need to tell people at work about this."
00:54:45.005,00:54:46.255,-Agreed. -Cool.
00:54:46.880,00:54:49.380,Then let's go because I am starving.
00:54:55.838,00:54:57.296,Jiminy Cricket!
00:54:57.380,00:54:59.255,"For God's sake, would you please start cursing?"
00:54:59.338,00:55:00.213,"No. Whatever, come on."
00:55:00.296,00:55:02.546,"So, what is she like?"
00:55:03.755,00:55:05.046,"You know, it's so bizarre."
00:55:05.130,00:55:07.380,"Just last week, she was North Korea."
00:55:07.463,00:55:10.630,"And now, when I think about her, I can't stop smiling."
00:55:10.713,00:55:11.671,Aww.
00:55:11.838,00:55:12.963,That's so nice.
00:55:13.046,00:55:14.421,She wants to get to know me.
00:55:14.505,00:55:15.380,Oh.
00:55:15.880,00:55:17.130,Sh... oot.
00:55:17.213,00:55:19.213,"Yeah, says she wants to make up for lost time."
00:55:19.296,00:55:20.880,"-Well, that's great. -Mm!"
00:55:21.505,00:55:24.130,-Not great. She wants to meet my friends. -So?
00:55:24.213,00:55:25.588,-I'd be happy to. -No.
00:55:25.671,00:55:29.546,My friends from Harvard and the Peace Corps.
00:55:29.630,00:55:30.755,-Who don't actually-- -Yes.
00:55:30.838,00:55:31.838,"Oh, f-word."
00:55:33.213,00:55:34.338,"God, that's so annoying."
00:55:34.421,00:55:35.505,What's annoying? Your face?
00:55:35.588,00:55:36.463,"Oh, God."
00:55:41.546,00:55:43.630,I want to explain myself to both of you.
00:55:44.630,00:55:47.171,"-You don't have to, it's-- -Oh, no. He does."
00:55:47.921,00:55:52.421,"We used to say Zoe got her spirited streak from her mother, but now we know that's only half true."
00:55:53.130,00:55:57.630,"You know, when Zoe started looking for you, I didn't know if it was healthy or not."
00:55:57.838,00:56:00.713,"And after a while, you gave up."
00:56:01.713,00:56:04.005,And... something went out in you.
00:56:04.088,00:56:07.213,"I know what your mother would have said. She would have said, Fix it, Andy."
00:56:07.713,00:56:14.046,"So I kept the feelers out, and then suddenly, miraculously, there you were online."
00:56:14.130,00:56:15.671,And impressively so.
00:56:15.755,00:56:24.796,"I didn't know if you would want to connect with Zoe, and I didn't want to take the chance on her being rejected, so I brought you in under the guise of a job interview to suss you out."
00:56:24.880,00:56:26.755,"And you were terrific, you were fantastic."
00:56:26.838,00:56:29.671,I would have hired you without this connection.
00:56:30.130,00:56:35.338,"And then Zoe walked in, and seeing the two of you butting heads together, I just-- You manipulated us."
00:56:35.421,00:56:37.213,Well... perhaps.
00:56:37.921,00:56:40.713,Although I wasn't the one who suggested the competition.
00:56:43.380,00:56:47.213,Is that Maria Maya Vargas? What are the odds?
00:56:49.046,00:56:53.380,"Yes, we were just on our way to the alumni social for Norton."
00:56:53.463,00:56:55.713,"-Wharton. -Wharton, Wharton, yeah."
00:56:55.796,00:56:59.796,"Um, Zoe, Anderson, -these are my friends from-- -Harvard."
00:57:00.588,00:57:03.421,"We, uh-- We, uh, did some time in the Peace Corps together."
00:57:04.046,00:57:05.296,We saved whales.
00:57:06.588,00:57:10.463,"Yes, so you're Maya's little girl, huh? She has your eyes."
00:57:10.546,00:57:12.255,Aren't you guys gonna be late for your mixer?
00:57:12.338,00:57:13.796,-Okay. -Philanthropy never waits.
00:57:13.880,00:57:15.213,Always saving something.
00:57:15.713,00:57:17.505,I thought you said it was an alumni social.
00:57:17.588,00:57:21.296,"Well, we wanted to give our men a reason to put their tuxes on."
00:57:21.380,00:57:23.713,Before we gave our men a reason to take 'em off.
00:57:27.380,00:57:29.463,"Okay, all right. Nice to meet you, ladies."
00:57:30.463,00:57:33.088,It really is so nice to finally meet some of Maya's friends.
00:57:36.880,00:57:39.463,-Uh-huh. -Unlike the bug up your arse.
00:57:39.546,00:57:41.296,"I mean, come on, Joan, seriously?"
00:57:41.796,00:57:42.838,Save the Whales?
00:57:42.921,00:57:44.713,"Well, she nailed it in rehearsal."
00:57:45.421,00:57:46.921,"Anyway, we were helping."
00:57:47.713,00:57:49.088,"Still coming to my birthday, right?"
00:57:49.838,00:57:50.713,Of course.
00:57:51.588,00:57:53.005,I just wish you would have told me.
00:57:53.088,00:57:55.005,"Well, she said she wanted to meet your friends."
00:57:55.088,00:57:56.255,"-Ugh. -Oh, I'm sorry."
00:57:56.338,00:57:57.880,Suddenly we don't exist?
00:57:58.755,00:57:59.588,Hey...
00:58:00.088,00:58:02.296,don't confuse this new Facebook thing...
00:58:02.921,00:58:04.546,"with who you really are, okay?"
00:58:06.046,00:58:07.838,My daughter thinks I'm this amazing person.
00:58:07.963,00:58:09.713,-What am I supposed to do? -I don't know!
00:58:09.796,00:58:11.463,Try telling her the damn truth?
00:58:12.630,00:58:13.796,You don't understand.
00:58:14.421,00:58:16.296,All right? That would kill her. I...
00:58:17.338,00:58:21.880,Maybe... one day when we get to know each other better-- One day when you get to know her.
00:58:21.963,00:58:23.963,I remember you saying the same thing about Trey.
00:58:24.046,00:58:25.421,That's a shitty thing to say.
00:58:25.505,00:58:27.921,"I'm sorry. Well, if the shite fits..."
00:58:29.130,00:58:31.171,You know what? You have no idea what it's been like.
00:58:31.255,00:58:32.755,You have no idea...
00:58:33.963,00:58:36.505,how many times I still thought about her every day.
00:58:37.421,00:58:38.588,Is she okay?
00:58:39.546,00:58:41.671,Is she happy? Is she alive?
00:58:42.671,00:58:46.088,"And, you're right, now I've found her and it's a mess."
00:58:46.171,00:58:48.630,"I'm a mess. And, you know what, I hate the lie."
00:58:49.838,00:58:52.505,But I have to be the person that she thinks I am or...
00:58:53.921,00:58:55.213,I could lose her again.
00:58:58.338,00:58:59.963,And I couldn't survive that.
00:59:00.630,00:59:02.588,You act like you don't have a choice.
00:59:03.546,00:59:04.463,I don't.
00:59:06.630,00:59:07.505,Well...
00:59:08.755,00:59:12.505,"You know, it's sad that she's not gonna meet the old Maya..."
00:59:14.755,00:59:16.338,because she was pretty amazing.
00:59:26.671,00:59:27.671,Thanks.
00:59:28.630,00:59:30.171,"Hey, don't be a stranger, huh?"
00:59:32.421,00:59:33.880,I was kind of a regular.
00:59:34.546,00:59:35.421,When?
00:59:43.213,00:59:47.505,You used to sleep or nurse while I tried to figure out our next move.
00:59:50.505,00:59:51.421,"Wait, we were..."
00:59:52.505,00:59:53.421,homeless?
00:59:54.838,00:59:58.505,"I mean, there was a while where we didn't have a place, but..."
01:00:00.130,01:00:01.588,"I mean, I tried... I mean..."
01:00:03.838,01:00:04.755,But...
01:00:11.046,01:00:12.005,It's okay.
01:00:22.130,01:00:23.630,I said goodbye to you here.
01:00:30.380,01:00:31.963,Kissed you for the last time.
01:00:36.921,01:00:38.088,December 23rd.
01:00:45.338,01:00:47.588,Christmas is not exactly my favorite time of the year.
01:00:49.546,01:00:50.838,Maybe we should fix that.
01:00:59.755,01:01:00.796,"All right, hold on!"
01:01:03.713,01:01:06.380,"Okay, got it. We're good."
01:01:17.755,01:01:19.171,-I'll put it on. -Come on.
01:01:20.130,01:01:21.130,Ta-da!
01:01:21.796,01:01:23.338,"Oh, it's perfect!"
01:01:25.046,01:01:26.130,"Hi, guys."
01:01:26.755,01:01:27.713,What's going on?
01:01:27.796,01:01:30.296,We have some good news.
01:01:30.380,01:01:32.213,And some of the other stuff.
01:01:32.296,01:01:33.421,"First, the good news."
01:01:33.505,01:01:36.380,I have found the hole in the market.
01:01:37.046,01:01:39.088,-Fruit? -Not just any fruit.
01:01:40.380,01:01:41.255,Tangerine.
01:01:41.338,01:01:42.505,No one has done it.
01:01:42.588,01:01:47.963,Our data shows a 37% increase in sales on any cream with a featured citrus component.
01:01:48.046,01:01:49.713,But it comes with a price.
01:01:50.421,01:01:51.421,How much of a price?
01:01:55.755,01:01:57.088,"Oh, just give me that."
01:01:57.171,01:01:58.130,Thank you.
01:01:58.213,01:02:04.630,"To make all three products entirely green from the tangerine extract, it'll cost 13% more than Zoe and Ron's line."
01:02:05.546,01:02:07.130,"My God, can we bring that down?"
01:02:07.213,01:02:09.921,Change often comes at a cost.
01:02:10.005,01:02:12.671,"The game was to create a line that was more profitable, not less."
01:02:12.755,01:02:16.171,"Well, maybe you could ask them for more time."
01:02:16.255,01:02:18.713,That'd be admitting that we couldn't do what we said we could.
01:02:18.796,01:02:20.213,What you said we could.
01:02:24.838,01:02:27.921,"Oh, everything I touch gets ruined."
01:02:31.630,01:02:34.171,"Oh, look who's back from the city."
01:02:35.255,01:02:36.213,What's wrong?
01:02:36.921,01:02:37.838,They fire you?
01:02:39.255,01:02:40.255,Not yet.
01:02:41.630,01:02:42.921,Nine weeks of work and I...
01:02:43.630,01:02:45.046,So you didn't come clean?
01:02:47.130,01:02:49.713,"-You're with your daughter again. -Who's drop-dead, by the way."
01:02:51.338,01:02:53.088,Thank you guys for what you did the other day.
01:02:53.171,01:02:55.130,"I mean, it was a little pathetic, but it was..."
01:02:55.213,01:02:56.130,sweet.
01:02:57.463,01:03:01.921,I just wish I didn't get so caught up with all this data and spreadsheets.
01:03:02.838,01:03:04.713,I just should have stuck with what got me there.
01:03:05.255,01:03:06.088,There's just...
01:03:06.588,01:03:07.588,so many products.
01:03:07.671,01:03:08.588,"Oh, tell me about it."
01:03:08.671,01:03:13.713,"You got your under-eye, your face cream, your hand cream, which, in my house, is called my son's don't ask cream."
01:03:13.796,01:03:15.505,"-Mine, too. -All right. Really?"
01:03:15.588,01:03:19.046,"If only there was one thing to cut through all the noise, you know?"
01:03:20.630,01:03:21.588,One thing.
01:03:24.463,01:03:25.296,"Oh, my God."
01:03:25.880,01:03:26.796,What?
01:03:29.338,01:03:30.463,You guys are amazing.
01:03:31.255,01:03:32.213,I love you.
01:03:32.796,01:03:33.671,And I gotta go.
01:03:39.421,01:03:40.255,One product?
01:03:40.338,01:03:42.796,"Yeah, that does the job of all three."
01:03:45.088,01:03:46.963,We should run it by Hildy to check with research.
01:03:47.046,01:03:49.213,"No, that's what got us in this mess in the first place."
01:03:49.588,01:03:53.255,"Look, I have a good feeling about this. We make one product that does everything."
01:03:53.338,01:03:56.963,"Rejuvenates, blocks the sun, moisturizes the whole body."
01:03:57.046,01:04:01.796,"Maya, SPF formulas that block the sun and stay on your skin can be toxic if you leave them on overnight."
01:04:01.880,01:04:05.213,Isn't there a natural compound with sun protection that isn't toxic?
01:04:05.296,01:04:06.130,No.
01:04:06.630,01:04:07.463,Shit.
01:04:07.546,01:04:09.255,-What? -The Christmas party.
01:04:09.338,01:04:11.046,Let's go. We can brainstorm later.
01:04:11.630,01:04:13.255,"Um, I can't."
01:04:13.338,01:04:14.213,Why not?
01:04:15.213,01:04:16.046,Not invited.
01:04:16.130,01:04:17.171,Execs only.
01:04:17.255,01:04:19.546,"Give me a break. You're my date. Ariana, too."
01:04:19.630,01:04:21.421,You guys meet me there. It's on the top floor.
01:04:21.505,01:04:22.463,She'll be thrilled.
01:04:36.921,01:04:37.838,You okay?
01:04:38.463,01:04:40.755,Another reason why I don't mind banishment to cat food.
01:04:40.838,01:04:42.088,I'm not great at these things.
01:04:43.630,01:04:45.296,Why did Felix banish you?
01:04:46.088,01:04:48.588,The whole Nutralis scandal was Felix's idea.
01:04:48.671,01:04:52.838,He wanted me to hide the fact that we were repackaging shampoo as hair growth product.
01:04:52.921,01:04:54.005,I wouldn't do it.
01:04:55.713,01:04:59.421,"So he let you keep your job if you kept your mouth shut, but he banned you to Siberia."
01:05:01.296,01:05:02.546,Why didn't you just quit?
01:05:03.546,01:05:04.463,That's what he wants.
01:05:05.463,01:05:07.338,"Oh, Team Green's in the house."
01:05:07.421,01:05:08.338,Hey.
01:05:09.171,01:05:11.005,You look... amazing.
01:05:11.088,01:05:11.921,Thank you.
01:05:12.130,01:05:14.171,You look pretty damn fine yourself.
01:05:14.671,01:05:15.880,"My God, I love that ring."
01:05:15.963,01:05:18.380,It's my grandmother's. The one thing she left me.
01:05:18.463,01:05:20.755,The only thing my grandmother left me was a plant.
01:05:24.546,01:05:26.588,I seem to have found the cool crowd.
01:05:26.671,01:05:28.171,Two of the most beautiful people here.
01:05:31.463,01:05:32.338,Right.
01:05:33.463,01:05:34.796,I'm going to go get a drink.
01:05:36.338,01:05:37.463,Would you like to dance?
01:05:37.546,01:05:38.463,Sure.
01:05:41.046,01:05:41.921,Another Scotch.
01:05:42.838,01:05:45.505,Did you accidentally push the up button on the elevator?
01:05:45.588,01:05:48.005,Because I don't think you're supposed to be on this floor.
01:05:48.088,01:05:49.338,I'm here with Maya.
01:05:49.421,01:05:50.713,"Oh, are you?"
01:05:50.796,01:05:51.880,"Well, enjoy tonight."
01:05:51.963,01:05:54.255,You'll be back with your cat food before you know it.
01:06:00.130,01:06:01.796,You look awesome.
01:06:01.880,01:06:04.005,I'm surprised you made it off the elevator.
01:06:04.088,01:06:05.713,"Yeah, I, um..."
01:06:06.338,01:06:07.463,I barfed in my purse.
01:06:08.630,01:06:09.546,"Ah, I see."
01:06:10.296,01:06:11.171,Um...
01:06:11.755,01:06:12.963,Do you trust me?
01:06:14.130,01:06:15.046,Yeah.
01:06:21.505,01:06:23.880,She left college to join me here at the company.
01:06:25.130,01:06:27.421,"I probably shouldn't have let her, but..."
01:06:28.338,01:06:29.796,we were both hurting and...
01:06:30.046,01:06:31.713,"Anyway, it's time for her now to..."
01:06:32.338,01:06:33.421,go and live her life...
01:06:33.921,01:06:37.088,"go back to art school, forget about the old man for a while."
01:06:37.880,01:06:38.713,Wait...
01:06:39.213,01:06:40.421,She went to art school?
01:06:40.505,01:06:41.963,You saw the apartment.
01:06:44.296,01:06:47.005,"-Wait, those portraits were hers? -Mm-hmm."
01:06:48.421,01:06:52.046,Cynthia and I used to joke about which one of us she got her talent from.
01:06:56.755,01:06:58.755,You both did an incredible job with her.
01:07:00.921,01:07:02.671,"Oh, my God, are we outside?"
01:07:02.755,01:07:05.880,"It's fine, okay? Everything's fine. I got you."
01:07:05.963,01:07:08.088,-I'm going to take off the blindfold. -No.
01:07:08.171,01:07:10.255,"And when I do, I want you to look right at me."
01:07:10.755,01:07:11.838,Can I say something?
01:07:12.380,01:07:13.296,"Yeah, of course."
01:07:13.380,01:07:16.546,You don't have to pull some Titanic bullshit just to get close to me.
01:07:18.296,01:07:19.130,Okay.
01:07:19.630,01:07:21.963,"Good, 'cause I kinda hate that movie."
01:07:22.380,01:07:26.296,"You know, the door that she's floating on at the end, it's-- Big enough for both of them, yeah."
01:07:26.380,01:07:28.171,"Yes, exactly!"
01:07:28.255,01:07:30.880,Can we please move this conversation inside?
01:07:30.963,01:07:32.838,"One hundred percent. Absolutely, okay."
01:07:32.921,01:07:34.505,-Okay. -Going back inside. We're turning.
01:07:34.588,01:07:35.880,-I got you. -Okay.
01:07:39.546,01:07:40.921,Congratulations on China.
01:07:41.005,01:07:45.880,Apparently that dinner went very well. Jiang was so impressed with our facilities he wants to make a deal.
01:07:45.963,01:07:50.130,"Once I set him up with the tour, -I was certain he'd be in. -Wait, that was-- Mind if we cut in?"
01:07:52.838,01:07:54.088,I underestimated you.
01:07:54.171,01:07:55.463,-Did you? -Yeah.
01:07:56.755,01:07:59.005,You're a much bigger scumbag than I thought you were.
01:07:59.546,01:08:01.838,"Really? Because I have an inkling you are, too."
01:08:03.130,01:08:05.296,"Anyway, we completed our project this afternoon."
01:08:06.171,01:08:07.213,That's impossible.
01:08:07.546,01:08:08.380,Is it?
01:08:15.130,01:08:17.838,If it isn't the second worst poker player in the world.
01:08:22.963,01:08:25.963,"I may have had a hand in it, sir. Thank you for coming, Sam."
01:08:26.046,01:08:29.338,"And, of course, you remember Miss Vargas from her years at Value Shop."
01:08:29.838,01:08:31.838,I don't know that I do.
01:08:33.838,01:08:35.588,I consulted locally.
01:08:36.171,01:08:38.921,"You've built a great business, Mr. Weiskopf. You should be very proud."
01:08:39.005,01:08:41.880,Hmm. Does anyone else find it just a little strange that...
01:08:51.130,01:08:53.171,I know what you're doing. It's not gonna work.
01:08:56.296,01:08:57.630,"What's your story, Ron?"
01:09:00.255,01:09:01.505,I can dance like that.
01:09:02.796,01:09:09.046,"I tend to lean to the nurture side of the whole evolution thing, -Meaning? -Assholes aren't born, they're made."
01:09:09.130,01:09:10.546,"What made you an asshole, Ron?"
01:09:10.630,01:09:13.421,-I come from an extremely long line. -Really?
01:09:13.505,01:09:17.130,'Cause I get the feeling that there's something smaller than your brain.
01:09:18.046,01:09:19.213,And it isn't your ego.
01:09:20.296,01:09:27.755,"I really don't care how you got here, Maria Vargas, because once everyone realizes what a disaster you and your non-existent product are, I guarantee you..."
01:09:28.546,01:09:29.671,you'll be a fast memory.
01:09:30.796,01:09:31.713,What did you say?
01:09:32.838,01:09:34.046,You're a disaster.
01:09:35.255,01:09:36.088,That's it!
01:09:48.630,01:09:51.338,"Hey, um, just to be clear..."
01:09:52.463,01:09:53.796,I'm kinda kinky.
01:10:04.255,01:10:06.505,We should probably come up with a safe word.
01:10:06.588,01:10:07.588,"Chase, we gotta go."
01:10:07.671,01:10:08.755,-What? -Now!
01:10:16.838,01:10:18.380,I realized something at the party.
01:10:19.046,01:10:21.671,"Even out of the biggest disaster, there can still be hope."
01:10:21.755,01:10:23.838,Which disaster are we talking about?
01:10:23.921,01:10:25.963,"-Hiroshima. -Wait, what?"
01:10:26.046,01:10:31.421,"After we dropped the bomb, the military sent a team into Japan to see if the radiation had depleted."
01:10:31.505,01:10:34.963,The only thing left that hadn't been destroyed was one single living tree.
01:10:35.046,01:10:36.838,The leaves had already started growing back.
01:10:36.921,01:10:39.505,"The citizens, they built a shrine around this tree."
01:10:39.588,01:10:41.130,And the soldiers took clippings from it.
01:10:42.255,01:10:43.921,One of those soldiers was my grandpa.
01:10:44.421,01:10:46.255,What kind of a tree was it?
01:10:47.088,01:10:48.171,Silver Ginkgo.
01:10:49.921,01:10:55.213,"After my grandpa returned home, he took his clippings and planted a tree for my grandma."
01:10:55.296,01:10:57.296,And it's resistant to radiation.
01:10:57.380,01:10:58.671,"AKA, the sun."
01:11:01.755,01:11:03.130,-Here. -What?
01:11:03.755,01:11:05.213,"What, w-we're breaking in?"
01:11:05.296,01:11:07.380,"You know they have Ginkgo trees in Central Park, right?"
01:11:07.463,01:11:09.796,"Not the same kind. Besides, that's my plant in there."
01:11:19.921,01:11:21.713,"Oh, hey, buddy. Hi."
01:11:28.296,01:11:29.255,Ah.
01:11:29.421,01:11:30.713,"Thank you, Abuela."
01:11:49.546,01:11:50.588,Five days out.
01:11:51.338,01:11:54.380,"If you look carefully, you can almost see smoke coming off."
01:11:54.463,01:11:55.463,Stop it.
01:11:57.921,01:12:01.505,"Tell us, what's the first thing you're gonna do when you get the big promotion?"
01:12:01.588,01:12:02.921,Fire my annoying boyfriend?
01:12:03.005,01:12:06.213,"No way, I've got tenure, baby. My union would never allow it."
01:12:09.630,01:12:11.630,"Oh, my... Stop!"
01:12:27.630,01:12:32.755,"It's not because everyone thinks you're delusional for trying to create a new product with just three weeks to go, just..."
01:12:32.838,01:12:37.630,Ron and I are actually going to be working together next cycle-- Uh-uh! Say less.
01:12:39.588,01:12:41.088,"God, that felt good."
01:12:41.796,01:12:43.171,I can still hear you.
01:12:44.171,01:12:45.671,"Look, how long could this take?"
01:12:45.755,01:12:47.713,"To be honest, it could take a lifetime."
01:12:47.796,01:12:49.880,Don't worry. We got this.
01:13:33.755,01:13:36.963,"I mean, I like the smell, but no one else will."
01:13:37.755,01:13:38.630,Trying again.
01:14:02.046,01:14:02.921,Not me.
01:14:13.796,01:14:14.630,Nope.
01:14:18.046,01:14:18.921,Nada.
01:14:22.546,01:14:24.130,"-Oh, you suck! -What?"
01:14:31.421,01:14:32.296,It's glowing.
01:14:35.130,01:14:36.088,What's it mean?
01:14:46.546,01:14:47.921,Everything all right in here?
01:14:49.255,01:14:50.171,You need something?
01:14:50.255,01:14:52.588,No hard feelings with Hildy jumping ship.
01:14:53.213,01:14:54.755,Why? You didn't get my thank-you note?
01:14:55.630,01:14:56.588,See you in the morning.
01:15:00.838,01:15:01.671,What?
01:15:01.921,01:15:02.796,Tell her.
01:15:03.171,01:15:04.046,-What? -Now.
01:15:05.838,01:15:07.088,"Okay, what?!"
01:15:07.588,01:15:08.421,It works.
01:15:08.505,01:15:12.880,"Oh, my God! Yes, yes, yes!"
01:15:12.963,01:15:14.921,"Okay, we have our presentation tomorrow."
01:15:15.005,01:15:17.296,-We need a wow factor. -Yes.
01:15:17.380,01:15:18.588,And I have an idea.
01:15:19.546,01:15:22.880,We've tasked two teams with two different challenges.
01:15:23.630,01:15:32.713,"Zoe's team set out to create a slightly more organic alternative to an existing product line, while Maya's task was to create a completely new one."
01:15:33.046,01:15:34.713,A totally green line.
01:15:35.005,01:15:35.880,Zoe?
01:15:41.046,01:15:43.921,You asked us to re-purpose one organic line.
01:15:44.421,01:15:46.546,"Well, we made two."
01:15:47.338,01:15:48.171,Skincare...
01:15:48.713,01:15:49.588,And make-up.
01:15:52.921,01:15:56.463,"With a minimal cost, we made our product 6% more organic than our previous line."
01:15:56.546,01:16:04.713,We estimate we can raise our price per unit by 4% and increase our annual skincare revenue by 23 million.
01:16:08.838,01:16:11.171,"That's very impressive. Maya, your ball."
01:16:17.755,01:16:24.588,"Well, my team, Chase Horowitz, Ariana Ng, and I, have challenged ourselves to think outside the box."
01:16:25.255,01:16:29.088,"And in keeping with that theme, we'd like to move our presentation..."
01:16:29.755,01:16:30.838,outside.
01:16:33.588,01:16:37.338,"-Okay, but I still don't think we need-- -Please. Wow factor."
01:16:38.671,01:16:39.546,Okay.
01:16:40.755,01:16:44.005,We're standing beneath this tree for a very special reason.
01:16:44.088,01:16:51.505,"Consumers are always looking for something natural and real, but they're often overwhelmed by the amount of choices that are out there."
01:16:51.588,01:16:56.588,"Words, like paralyzed, confused, and lost kept popping up in our research."
01:16:57.338,01:16:59.338,We use one bar of soap for our entire body.
01:16:59.421,01:17:00.963,Why do we subdivide our face?
01:17:04.171,01:17:09.338,I think F&amp;C has an opportunity to double our market share by giving people what they want and what they need.
01:17:10.755,01:17:12.671,One organic product that does it all.
01:17:12.755,01:17:13.796,And that product...
01:17:14.463,01:17:16.005,comes from a Ginkgo tree...
01:17:16.630,01:17:17.713,similar to this one.
01:17:19.671,01:17:27.463,All-in-one Ginkgo cream. We estimate we can raise our price per unit by 9% and increase our annual skincare revenue by 63 million.
01:17:31.130,01:17:35.588,It's a revolutionary idea that we think is really gonna take off...
01:17:37.463,01:17:40.005,and signify a new era in skincare.
01:17:40.505,01:17:44.671,A product that will naturally and delicately make our beauty soar.
01:17:49.505,01:17:50.588,Wow!
01:17:53.338,01:17:55.005,Maybe they're just stunned.
01:17:56.546,01:17:57.421,Any questions?
01:18:02.921,01:18:05.963,"No, I'm getting her in trouble. It's not the..."
01:18:07.171,01:18:09.546,"Oh, look who showed up."
01:18:10.338,01:18:11.380,You owe me five bucks.
01:18:12.796,01:18:15.088,Well? Did the presentation go good?
01:18:17.505,01:18:18.588,Did they like it?
01:18:18.671,01:18:19.713,Until Peter showed up.
01:18:21.505,01:18:24.005,Dill! You're home!
01:18:24.921,01:18:27.171,Hi! How's Stanford?
01:18:27.255,01:18:28.921,"Yes, how's Stanford? Tell her. I can't."
01:18:29.421,01:18:33.546,Why waste four years on a piece of paper that says I know how to do what I already know how to do?
01:18:33.630,01:18:34.505,Right.
01:18:36.463,01:18:37.380,Excuse me.
01:18:40.463,01:18:41.921,She's really pissed at me.
01:18:42.005,01:18:43.921,Yeah. She doesn't want you to wind up like me.
01:18:44.005,01:18:45.088,What are you talking about?
01:18:45.588,01:18:46.796,You're killing it right now.
01:18:48.755,01:18:51.255,"You're only allowed so many bad decisions, Dill."
01:18:51.338,01:18:54.588,Dropping out now handicaps your ability to make good ones.
01:18:54.671,01:18:55.588,Look who's back.
01:18:57.046,01:18:58.421,-Hey. -Hey.
01:19:00.380,01:19:02.588,-I was hoping to see you. -Yeah.
01:19:03.171,01:19:05.171,"Yeah, you... You look different."
01:19:07.296,01:19:08.213,What? Is that bad?
01:19:08.838,01:19:16.505,"Hey, everyone, I want to thank you all for coming to celebrate the only Christmas birthday that actually matters."
01:19:16.588,01:19:18.588,"Earmuffs, Jesus. You know you're my boo."
01:19:21.088,01:19:22.338,Can I talk to you?
01:19:23.255,01:19:24.088,Yeah.
01:19:29.505,01:19:30.505,"Look, um..."
01:19:32.338,01:19:34.963,There's something I never told you-- About your daughter.
01:19:36.005,01:19:37.796,"Yeah, Joan... She told me."
01:19:38.838,01:19:40.213,"I mean, all that talk about..."
01:19:40.838,01:19:41.713,family and...
01:19:42.546,01:19:45.630,I thought it was me you were hesitant about.
01:19:45.713,01:19:47.963,"No, I was ashamed. I just..."
01:19:50.463,01:19:52.130,I thought I didn't deserve to...
01:19:53.630,01:19:54.505,have...
01:19:57.046,01:19:59.005,-I should have told you. -You should have told me.
01:19:59.088,01:20:02.088,You let me fall in love with a version of you.
01:20:03.046,01:20:05.588,And no relationship built on a lie can ever survive.
01:20:09.046,01:20:10.546,You were always good enough.
01:20:11.255,01:20:12.130,But you...
01:20:12.255,01:20:14.046,You're the only one that ever doubted it.
01:20:25.630,01:20:26.505,Hello?
01:20:29.255,01:20:30.088,What?
01:20:31.630,01:20:32.463,Now?
01:20:36.921,01:20:38.588,I can't believe you're still here.
01:20:39.713,01:20:40.713,Is everything okay?
01:20:40.796,01:20:43.255,"Well, it could have waited till Monday, but..."
01:20:44.838,01:20:47.880,then I wouldn't be able to say this to you personally and...
01:20:48.838,01:20:51.755,you wouldn't have the weekend to prepare your speech.
01:20:53.088,01:20:53.921,Speech?
01:20:54.005,01:20:57.171,The board has voted unanimously to endorse your product.
01:20:57.255,01:20:58.421,"Oh, my God!"
01:20:58.921,01:21:01.338,"Oh, my God! Even after the whole bird thing?"
01:21:01.421,01:21:03.421,"You know, I've never seen a dove explode before."
01:21:04.796,01:21:06.171,Congratulations.
01:21:07.963,01:21:11.255,"Now, apart from the donation we'll have to make to the National Bird Society..."
01:21:11.838,01:21:15.796,"you are going to help make this company a lot of money, and that is good for us all."
01:21:15.880,01:21:16.713,Mm-hmm.
01:21:16.796,01:21:19.296,We want you to present at our distributors conference this Monday.
01:21:19.380,01:21:21.671,It is a big deal. It's streamed online.
01:21:21.755,01:21:24.505,"Business Weekly, Forbes, Fortune, they all cover it."
01:21:25.255,01:21:26.088,Wow.
01:21:26.171,01:21:27.046,"Yeah, and..."
01:21:27.630,01:21:29.171,there is one more thing.
01:21:29.838,01:21:30.713,Go ahead.
01:21:30.796,01:21:32.421,We don't want you to consult anymore.
01:21:33.255,01:21:35.755,We want you to join us at the company permanently.
01:21:57.255,01:21:59.630,What is the matter? You should be ecstatic.
01:22:00.838,01:22:01.880,I am.
01:22:02.546,01:22:05.130,"It's just been a crazy couple of weeks, that's all."
01:22:05.546,01:22:06.630,"Yeah, for us both."
01:22:11.755,01:22:13.713,-You're quite the photographer. -Oh...
01:22:14.255,01:22:17.546,Why didn't you tell me that the photographs in the apartment were yours?
01:22:17.630,01:22:21.130,"I haven't even touched a camera in, like, five years."
01:22:21.213,01:22:22.296,Do you miss it?
01:22:23.046,01:22:23.921,Sometimes.
01:22:24.546,01:22:26.005,But my dad needs me.
01:22:26.921,01:22:28.713,Your dad needs you to be happy.
01:22:31.255,01:22:33.130,Have you thought about going back to school?
01:22:33.921,01:22:35.421,We just found each other.
01:22:35.671,01:22:37.505,"-Yeah, but we can still-- -It's in London."
01:22:40.296,01:22:41.338,-Oh. -Yeah.
01:22:43.463,01:22:44.296,Well...
01:22:47.963,01:22:49.421,I still think you should go.
01:22:50.255,01:22:51.088,Why?
01:22:52.338,01:22:53.755,"Because it's time, Zoe."
01:23:01.963,01:23:03.421,What you thinking about?
01:23:03.880,01:23:05.005,Nothing. Just...
01:23:06.005,01:23:09.588,Something my ex-boyfriend said earlier. I saw him tonight.
01:23:09.671,01:23:10.630,"Oh, wow."
01:23:11.921,01:23:13.296,I didn't know you had a...
01:23:14.046,01:23:16.130,You just never talked about him.
01:23:18.171,01:23:19.380,Why'd you guys split?
01:23:21.796,01:23:23.630,I wasn't completely honest with him.
01:23:24.130,01:23:25.130,Why not?
01:23:28.921,01:23:30.380,I guess I was afraid to be.
01:23:33.046,01:23:35.380,"Everything happens for a reason, right?"
01:23:36.630,01:23:39.213,Here's to us working together.
01:23:39.296,01:23:41.130,We're building a company with Dad.
01:23:41.796,01:23:43.171,Our company.
01:23:44.713,01:23:50.421,"Zoe, this is an amazing opportunity, but just don't-- Look, I can tell there's something holding you back from taking the job."
01:23:50.921,01:23:51.921,But just know...
01:23:53.005,01:23:55.921,I am so grateful to have you back in my life.
01:23:58.255,01:24:00.463,I think this could be really good for us.
01:24:01.755,01:24:03.005,"Maya, please."
01:24:04.130,01:24:05.421,Don't leave me again.
01:24:06.880,01:24:07.838,I need you.
01:24:43.088,01:24:43.921,Yep?
01:24:44.755,01:24:45.796,"Okay, put him through."
01:24:47.130,01:24:48.046,Mr. Taylor.
01:24:48.130,01:24:51.255,"Yes, Mr. Ebsen. Sorry for the delayed response."
01:24:54.421,01:24:57.963,"I got your message. I must say, I'm a bit confused."
01:24:58.046,01:25:00.505,We never had a Maria Vargas work here.
01:25:00.588,01:25:01.630,Really?
01:25:01.713,01:25:04.880,"I checked with personnel, went through all our records, and..."
01:25:05.380,01:25:08.755,"as far as Estée Lauder is concerned, that person never existed."
01:25:09.671,01:25:11.005,Okay. Thank you.
01:25:18.213,01:25:19.046,Hey.
01:25:19.546,01:25:20.588,What did you mean?
01:25:21.546,01:25:22.796,What did I mean?
01:25:24.005,01:25:24.880,"Uh, when..."
01:25:25.421,01:25:27.671,When you said the other night... When you...
01:25:28.421,01:25:29.421,Yeah?
01:25:29.505,01:25:31.088,"When you said that you were, um..."
01:25:31.630,01:25:32.463,You're kinky?
01:25:33.046,01:25:34.130,"Oh, that."
01:25:34.505,01:25:36.338,Oh. That's just something I say.
01:25:38.380,01:25:40.255,"Huh, okay. Yeah."
01:25:40.838,01:25:41.755,Or is it?
01:25:48.588,01:25:49.588,"Oh, man!"
01:25:58.838,01:25:59.796,Thank you.
01:25:59.880,01:26:08.463,"Now, my father would normally be making this introduction, but because of special circumstances, he is, for once, allowing someone else to get a word in."
01:26:11.421,01:26:17.421,"In a world of increasing competition and decreasing profits, sometimes you need a fresh perspective."
01:26:17.921,01:26:19.463,"Isn't that what you always say, Dad?"
01:26:19.546,01:26:20.838,When I can get a word in.
01:26:23.130,01:26:30.005,"So, we hired a woman who has achieved her success not by going by the book, but by trusting her gut."
01:26:31.505,01:26:36.213,"Someone who is not afraid to tell the truth, even if the truth hurts."
01:26:36.296,01:26:38.796,"Ladies and gentlemen, Maya Vargas."
01:26:54.546,01:26:55.505,"Thank you, Zoe."
01:26:56.213,01:26:57.171,Anderson...
01:26:58.755,01:27:00.255,thank you for giving me a chance.
01:27:01.755,01:27:08.796,"Some people never get a chance because they can't afford the right education, or they don't have the degree to get in the right doors."
01:27:10.546,01:27:11.630,"And you're correct, Zoe."
01:27:12.255,01:27:16.588,Maybe I am where I am today because I wasn't afraid to tell the truth.
01:27:19.588,01:27:20.630,Even if it hurts.
01:27:23.630,01:27:24.755,And the truth is...
01:27:28.130,01:27:29.213,The truth is...
01:27:32.255,01:27:33.421,The truth is a lie.

01:27:45.046,01:27:46.671,I invented my resume.
01:27:48.463,01:27:49.713,I never went to Wharton.
01:27:52.005,01:27:54.005,I never even graduated from high school.
01:27:54.796,01:27:56.671,-What? -Holy cow.
01:27:56.755,01:27:57.588,Cool.
01:27:58.338,01:28:00.671,I thought it was what I had to do to get in those doors.
01:28:00.755,01:28:02.338,And there you are.
01:28:05.546,01:28:07.296,Because I thought I wasn't good enough.
01:28:09.338,01:28:11.005,So I gave you a version of me.
01:28:12.046,01:28:13.505,But for better or for worse...
01:28:14.546,01:28:16.296,I have to be who I really am.

01:28:27.880,01:28:28.713,I'm sorry.
01:28:29.713,01:28:31.171,I shouldn't have lied.
01:28:33.046,01:28:33.921,To any of you.
01:28:39.838,01:28:41.088,But this product...
01:28:43.380,01:28:44.421,Not a lie.
01:28:47.338,01:28:48.255,It's amazing.
01:28:49.255,01:28:50.505,"Chase, Ariana..."
01:28:51.505,01:28:52.463,it's all yours.
01:28:53.088,01:28:53.921,What?
01:29:37.838,01:29:39.005,Was it all a lie?
01:29:41.005,01:29:41.838,Zoe.
01:29:41.921,01:29:45.380,The stuff about the adoption agency. Them telling you not to look for me.
01:29:46.338,01:29:47.421,"Was that a lie, too?"
01:29:48.005,01:29:49.130,"No, of course not."
01:29:49.213,01:29:51.296,"Well, how can I trust anything you say?"
01:29:54.088,01:29:57.380,"Listen, this is why I tried calling you last night."
01:29:58.255,01:29:59.213,I got my wish.
01:30:00.296,01:30:01.421,I got my girl back.
01:30:02.130,01:30:03.838,But I realized something.
01:30:03.921,01:30:07.338,"Okay, no relationship built on a lie can-- Bullshit."

01:33:13.588,01:33:20.213,Yeah. And our clients can even use their phone to pick out a specific cut of meat or a prepared salad or the third lemon from the back.
01:33:21.255,01:33:24.213,"My godson, Dilly, over there, created the app in between finals."
01:33:24.713,01:33:26.421,He works here when he's not at Stanford.
01:33:28.255,01:33:31.713,"You basically said to Value Shop, We're going to build a better mousetrap."
01:33:31.796,01:33:33.880,"And we said, We'd like to partner."
01:33:34.421,01:33:36.338,He's our little angel investor.
01:33:36.796,01:33:39.296,He negotiated points on some convertible debt.
01:33:39.380,01:33:40.505,It's a cute deal.
01:33:45.046,01:33:51.171,"If we'd only done it differently, chosen smarter, not made so many mistakes."
01:33:51.713,01:33:53.171,"If he didn't eat it, then I wouldn't."
01:33:53.255,01:33:54.088,Hi.
01:33:54.171,01:33:56.588,Hi. Could we talk for a second?
01:33:59.671,01:34:00.505,Yeah.
01:34:12.338,01:34:14.588,So I got what you left on my doorstep.
01:34:16.255,01:34:17.296,You really mean all this?
01:34:19.630,01:34:20.588,Ask me anything.
01:34:22.630,01:34:23.463,Okay.
01:34:24.088,01:34:24.963,-Are you-- -Yes.
01:34:26.921,01:34:28.713,You don't know what I was gonna ask.
01:34:28.921,01:34:30.921,"Whatever the question is, the answer's yes."
01:34:33.421,01:34:35.630,Did you really lose your daughter again?
01:34:38.255,01:34:39.088,Yes.
01:34:40.671,01:34:42.796,Are you ever gonna lie to me again?
01:34:48.296,01:34:49.171,Yes.
01:34:51.338,01:34:52.755,But that was the last time.
01:34:52.838,01:34:53.755,Funny.
01:34:57.213,01:34:58.171,Are you ready to...
01:34:58.671,01:34:59.713,have a family?
01:35:12.255,01:35:13.630,You are my family.
01:35:16.213,01:35:17.171,"So, yes."
01:35:22.796,01:35:23.630,Sorry.
01:35:23.713,01:35:26.380,This is broken. I'm just gonna... Okay.
01:35:41.088,01:35:42.463,our mistakes don't limit us.
01:35:43.421,01:35:44.838,Only our fears do.
01:35:45.921,01:35:52.088,"And as unpredictable as this journey has been, I am so glad it finally led me back to you."
01:35:53.296,01:35:54.671,Congratulations.
01:35:54.755,01:35:56.338,Your dad told me you were back.
01:35:56.838,01:35:57.671,Welcome home.
01:35:57.755,01:35:58.588,Thanks.
01:35:59.588,01:36:00.838,You got your degree.
01:36:03.338,01:36:04.171,Now what?
01:36:07.255,01:36:08.130,I don't know.
01:36:16.255,01:36:17.921,You think we could start over?
01:36:20.921,01:36:22.630,I was thinking of going for a run.
01:36:25.671,01:36:26.546,Okay.
01:36:28.630,01:36:30.046,Do you want to come with me?
01:36:35.963,01:36:36.838,Yeah.
01:36:39.338,01:36:40.255,I'd like that.
01:36:43.088,01:36:43.921,A lot.
01:36:55.880,01:36:57.088,I'm about to cry.
01:36:58.338,01:37:00.338,You guys are fricking pussies.
01:37:00.421,01:37:01.296,"Oh, come on."
01:37:02.255,01:37:03.505,What? He said fricking.
01:37:03.963,01:37:04.838,It's progress.
01:37:05.921,01:37:07.588,"This time, I'm not gonna be as easy on you."
01:37:07.671,01:37:08.505,"-Oh, yeah? -Uh-huh."
01:37:08.588,01:37:09.796,All right. Bring it.
01:37:20.796,01:37:22.296,to be whoever you want.
01:37:22.880,01:37:24.463,The only thing stopping you...
01:37:25.421,01:37:26.296,is you.
