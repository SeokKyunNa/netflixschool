00:01:16.451,00:01:19.287,"Hey, look, where's your cup-holders?"
00:01:19.287,00:01:22.374,I don't have one.
00:01:22.374,00:01:24.960,"$80,000 for this car and you ain't got no damn cup-holder?"
00:01:24.960,00:01:29.464,"It's $105,000, this happens to be one of the fastest production cars on the planet."
00:01:29.464,00:01:31.258,"0 to 60 in four seconds, sweetie."
00:01:31.258,00:01:34.261,This is a limited edition.
00:01:34.261,00:01:36.471,"No cup-holder, no back seat."
00:01:36.471,00:01:38.974,It's a shiny dick with two chairs in it.
00:01:38.974,00:01:42.269,"I guess we the balls, just dragging the fuck along."

00:02:37.240,00:02:40.160,"I bet you're a big Popeye Chicken-eating motherfucker, ain't you?"
00:02:40.160,00:02:41.787,"Hey, hey."
00:02:41.787,00:02:44.081,"Why I always got to get the big, thick motherfuckers?"
00:02:44.081,00:02:45.415,MAN 2: Out of the car now!

00:02:58.887,00:03:00.889,"Now, I ain't no Wesley Snipes."
00:03:00.889,00:03:06.687,I just hang out with stupid-ass friends that drive stupid-ass cars that attract a lot of motherfucking attention!
00:03:06.687,00:03:10.858,I need to jump over this car and smack your head.
00:03:10.858,00:03:13.568,You know what?
00:03:13.568,00:03:16.446,It's not about a fry.
00:03:16.446,00:03:18.448,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"

00:03:34.715,00:03:36.925,"Now let's hear one of those jokes, bitch."
00:05:11.937,00:05:14.564,"What do you think, guys?"
00:05:14.564,00:05:16.357,You remember your assignment?
00:05:16.357,00:05:18.277,"Yeah, I'm the decoy."
00:05:18.277,00:05:20.445,"Yes, you are."
00:05:26.994,00:05:28.745,CASPER: What the fuck are you doing?
00:05:30.538,00:05:34.251,"Hello, police?"
00:05:30.538,00:05:37.587,"I just saw something terrible, a policeman shot on South Miami and First Street. Help, please!"

00:09:39.829,00:09:42.207,Damn!
00:09:42.207,00:09:43.791,Did you have sweet dreams?
00:09:45.752,00:09:48.713,You're so nasty.
00:09:48.713,00:09:51.674,You always saying you want quality time.
00:09:51.674,00:09:55.970,"Well, right now I got the time and you damn sure got the quality."
00:09:56.971,00:09:58.557,Come on now.
00:09:59.640,00:10:00.808,You know what it is?
00:10:02.643,00:10:06.314,I can't remember the last time that we fell asleep together.
00:10:08.691,00:10:09.859,Baby...
00:10:11.403,00:10:14.448,"Baby, it's my job."
00:10:14.448,00:10:18.159,You know I'm a better cop when I get some in the morning.
00:10:18.159,00:10:19.702,I feel lighter on my feet.
00:10:19.702,00:10:22.997,"You're going to have to keep it in your pants, because I hear three little Burnetts coming."
00:10:22.997,00:10:24.583,That's cold.
00:10:24.583,00:10:26.918,You gonna leave me here like a humping dog.
00:10:28.295,00:10:30.004,"THERESA: Hi, baby boy!"
00:10:31.339,00:10:33.174,Daddy! Daddy!
00:10:37.637,00:10:43.560,"Dad, at school, people say I look weird."
00:10:43.560,00:10:47.688,"Boy, your daddy has that same problem. I got the ears."
00:10:47.688,00:10:50.442,They just out there for you to listen to people's problems.
00:10:50.442,00:10:54.237,You're an angel.
00:10:54.237,00:10:58.992,"THERESA: James, stop!"
00:10:58.992,00:11:01.869,And don't let me have to come down to that school.
00:11:01.869,00:11:03.997,"Mom, mom."
00:11:03.997,00:11:05.706,Talking about my boy's ears.
00:11:07.375,00:11:10.670,Uncle Mike's in the house!
00:11:10.670,00:11:12.755,"MIKE: Partner, partner!"
00:11:12.755,00:11:14.257,"Quincy, check that out."
00:11:14.257,00:11:17.344,QUINCY: What'd you take my food for?
00:11:17.344,00:11:20.805,"Don't kiss me, Mike!"
00:11:22.641,00:11:25.059,"Uncle Mike, did you have a date last night?"
00:11:25.059,00:11:26.978,"Ooh, did I!"
00:11:26.978,00:11:29.063,"Let me tell you, boy, now this girl was..."
00:11:29.063,00:11:32.775,"Hey, don't you go telling my son none of your sleazy sex stories."
00:11:32.775,00:11:34.361,I only tell your husband my sleazy sex stories.
00:11:34.361,00:11:36.321,Hey.
00:11:36.321,00:11:38.281,I don't want him knowing about them either. It gives him ideas.
00:11:38.281,00:11:39.824,Why you put me in this?
00:11:39.824,00:11:41.700,I'm with my babies.
00:11:41.700,00:11:43.328,Okay? Thank you.
00:11:43.328,00:11:44.412,Hello.
00:11:44.412,00:11:45.872,"Eat. Go on, girl."
00:11:45.872,00:11:48.916,No problem.
00:11:48.916,00:11:50.251,Oh.
00:11:52.253,00:11:53.547,You're on the mike with Mike.
00:11:53.547,00:11:55.549,Want Daddy to wipe your mouth?
00:11:55.549,00:11:59.678,"I think you mean to say, Get our asses down there, please, Captain."
00:12:01.346,00:12:02.889,Maybe not.
00:12:12.899,00:12:14.401,"Hey, baby!"
00:12:14.401,00:12:16.319,"Hey, Francine, where's Howard?"
00:12:16.319,00:12:19.280,Down there. He's looking for you. He's been in better moods.
00:12:22.158,00:12:24.035,"Aw, damn!"
00:12:24.035,00:12:26.287,"HOWARD: Get it done, goddamn it!"
00:12:27.622,00:12:29.748,"Welcome to our nightmare, boys."
00:12:31.000,00:12:32.377,See this?
00:12:32.377,00:12:34.504,"What's wrong with this picture, huh?"
00:12:35.714,00:12:37.591,Remember this room?
00:12:37.591,00:12:40.134,"These slats, they look familiar, don't they?"
00:12:40.134,00:12:43.471,There was these silver packets they looked like bricks.
00:12:43.471,00:12:46.099,"Little red tags on them, about so high?"
00:12:46.099,00:12:48.142,"All that heroin, gone."
00:12:48.142,00:12:50.395,This was our career bust.
00:12:50.395,00:12:52.813,Gone!
00:12:52.813,00:12:55.400,"No, let me call it what it is, this is fucked up!"
00:12:55.400,00:12:57.444,"You got that right, detective."
00:12:57.444,00:12:59.446,"Hello, Alison."
00:12:59.446,00:13:03.032,"You guys know Captain Sinclair, Internal Affairs' top watchdog."
00:13:03.032,00:13:05.952,"You know, I'd actually take that as a compliment if I didn't know you so well."
00:13:05.952,00:13:10.248,"Excuse me, but if you two want to get personal, I could step out."
00:13:10.248,00:13:13.376,There's nothing personal going on here.
00:13:13.376,00:13:18.381,"I mean, I love knowing that one leak, one headline can turn this nightmare into a media frenzy."
00:13:18.381,00:13:21.884,That's not gonna happen.
00:13:21.884,00:13:26.306,"Good. Why don't you start by looking here, because this had to have been an inside job."
00:13:26.306,00:13:28.849,And I'm gonna find out about it.
00:13:28.849,00:13:31.269,"Sanchez, Ruiz, you guys are late."
00:13:33.647,00:13:37.484,So they put this in for toxic drug fumes?
00:13:37.484,00:13:41.780,"Yeah, this was a brilliant design. This was really intelligent. I like this."
00:13:41.780,00:13:44.741,I didn't ask how he feels.
00:13:44.741,00:13:46.117,What does he know?
00:13:48.119,00:13:49.704,"Where were y'all last night, man?"
00:13:49.704,00:13:53.541,Why don't y'all just have your cousins bring the shit back and we can all get some sleep.
00:13:53.541,00:13:55.918,"We were gonna do that, but you know what happened?"
00:13:55.918,00:13:58.546,Your mama snorted up all the dope.
00:13:58.546,00:14:00.089,"All right, you two, get over there."
00:14:02.717,00:14:05.470,"O'Fee's gonna be all right, but he's got nothing to tell us."
00:14:05.470,00:14:09.182,"So they kill a decoy, it empties the station."
00:14:09.182,00:14:12.686,"But they don't kill a real cop, 'cause they know they'd have the whole force on their ass."
00:14:12.686,00:14:15.605,This was your case.
00:14:15.605,00:14:18.399,"Sanchez, Ruiz, you back them up with whatever they need."
00:14:18.399,00:14:20.193,With whatever they need.
00:14:20.193,00:14:21.944,"All right, but now wait a second."
00:14:21.944,00:14:24.030,"It was Carrera's drugs in the first place, right?"
00:14:24.030,00:14:26.157,"But it couldn't have been him, because he was killed in prison."
00:14:26.157,00:14:28.117,What about the rest of his crew?
00:14:28.117,00:14:29.952,The rest of those idiots don't have the precision to do this.
00:14:29.952,00:14:32.580,"But just in case I'm wrong, you guys check them out."
00:14:32.580,00:14:36.835,"Yeah, they'd have been up in here with Uzis, splashing O'Fee all over the place."
00:14:36.835,00:14:38.795,It takes brains to pull something like this.
00:14:38.795,00:14:40.839,Big cojones too.
00:14:40.839,00:14:42.674,"What the hell are you talking about, cojones?"
00:14:42.674,00:14:45.677,It would take me a month to explain to you what cojones are.
00:14:45.677,00:14:48.095,"You're in Miami, don't know cojones?"
00:14:48.095,00:14:50.223,Ho! Ho! Hey!
00:14:50.223,00:14:54.060,We got nothing.
00:14:54.060,00:14:57.104,The guy who pulled this off knew what he was doing.
00:14:57.104,00:14:59.607,And he left us nothing but a big fuck you.
00:14:59.607,00:15:04.529,"Ruiz, Sanchez, find out who installed the ventilating system, okay?"
00:15:07.240,00:15:09.325,"Oh, that's cold."
00:15:09.325,00:15:13.371,This could definitely be an inside job. Don't rule it out.
00:15:13.371,00:15:19.001,"The way I see it, we got 72 hours before the FBI and the DEA walk in here and shut us down."
00:15:19.001,00:15:21.295,And we're gonna be the bad guys.
00:15:21.295,00:15:25.925,"The politics demand that somebody take the rap for this, and it's gonna be us."
00:15:25.925,00:15:29.095,Just do what you do.
00:15:29.095,00:15:32.348,Jojo. What's up?
00:15:32.348,00:15:34.058,"Cutting drugs and shit like that, huh?"
00:15:34.058,00:15:36.728,"I don't know nothing about that, man."
00:15:36.728,00:15:38.145,I'm out of the drug business.
00:15:38.145,00:15:40.147,You know something.
00:15:40.147,00:15:42.609,I just said no to drugs.
00:15:42.609,00:15:45.111,You said no to drugs.
00:15:45.111,00:15:48.155,"Rubber, rubber, rubber."
00:15:48.155,00:15:49.949,Yeah.
00:15:49.949,00:15:52.577,So you don't know nothing?
00:15:52.577,00:15:54.328,I know tires.
00:15:54.328,00:15:57.248,"You telling me the truth, right?"
00:15:57.248,00:15:59.542,Would you lie to me?
00:16:06.883,00:16:08.927,"MARCUS: Yo, man, this is a waste of time."
00:16:08.927,00:16:11.137,"Oh, come on, man."
00:16:11.137,00:16:13.765,"I keep telling you, in Maxie's line of work, she definitely gets the 411."
00:16:13.765,00:16:17.560,Maxie! How'd I know I was gonna find you up in here?
00:16:21.188,00:16:24.066,"Listen, Max, we got to talk."
00:16:24.066,00:16:25.735,"Yeah, the equipment room."
00:16:25.735,00:16:28.070,Behave yourself.
00:16:35.912,00:16:37.121,Ooh...
00:16:38.998,00:16:42.251,"Listen, I need some help."
00:16:42.251,00:16:43.628,"So, what else is new?"
00:16:50.927,00:16:52.637,"Oh, sh..."
00:16:54.013,00:16:55.598,"Oh, sh..."
00:16:55.598,00:16:59.143,"Some major, major ill shit happened down at the P.D."
00:16:59.143,00:17:02.146,"There's a lot of heroin involved, there's gonna be a lot of cash involved."
00:17:02.146,00:17:05.566,There's definitely gonna be some jolly young men running around who want to party.
00:17:05.566,00:17:07.234,What do you need?
00:17:07.234,00:17:10.112,There's a lot of people who will talk to you that won't talk to me.
00:17:10.112,00:17:12.615,You mean customers?
00:17:12.615,00:17:18.245,"Listen, I'm not asking you to get into any wild shit. Just call me if you hear something."
00:17:18.245,00:17:21.081,I think I will call you.
00:17:29.883,00:17:31.425,What the hell are you doing?
00:17:31.425,00:17:33.803,Trying to keep my shit quick.
00:17:33.803,00:17:36.556,"Oh, that's right, ain't getting none at home."
00:17:36.556,00:17:38.140,"Go ahead, burn it off."
00:17:39.893,00:17:41.811,"Hey, we got anything, Francine?"
00:17:41.811,00:17:47.984,Sanchez says that the air conditioning contract went to Manuel Arrona of Key Biscayne.
00:17:47.984,00:17:50.695,He's working out of his house this week. That's the number.
00:17:58.244,00:18:00.287,He's not answering.
00:18:00.287,00:18:02.582,I guess we should just leave.
00:18:02.582,00:18:06.377,"What, make a trip all the way down here to high society for nothing?"
00:18:06.377,00:18:09.129,"No, man. That's what they got windows for."
00:18:09.129,00:18:10.506,"Oh, yeah, that should be okay."
00:18:15.595,00:18:18.180,I tripped.
00:18:18.180,00:18:20.099,"Right after I tripped, it just opened."
00:18:20.099,00:18:22.060,I guess they want us to come in.
00:18:22.060,00:18:23.519,Take a peek.
00:18:24.771,00:18:26.940,Hello!
00:18:26.940,00:18:29.776,We're your new neighbors.
00:18:29.776,00:18:31.903,Don't be alarmed.
00:18:31.903,00:18:34.739,"No, man! No. That's too much bass in your voice."
00:18:34.739,00:18:37.867,That scare white folks.
00:18:37.867,00:18:41.203,We were wondering if we can borrow some brown sugar.
00:18:47.376,00:18:50.546,You fart?
00:18:52.381,00:18:53.967,BOTH: Dead guy.
00:19:02.600,00:19:04.518,MARCUS: Ugh.
00:19:04.518,00:19:06.896,"Well, looks like somebody's home."
00:19:16.405,00:19:19.492,"Okay, let me take a stab at this one."
00:19:19.492,00:19:21.911,He sells the ventilation plans to the bad guys.
00:19:21.911,00:19:25.873,"He gets rich, but he gets dead."
00:19:25.873,00:19:28.584,I'm going to go call Homicide.
00:19:28.584,00:19:30.920,Why do you act like this every time we around a dead body?
00:19:30.920,00:19:32.797,It's cool. I just...
00:19:34.090,00:19:35.549,Please? Look around.
00:19:37.343,00:19:41.514,The smell and the...
00:19:51.107,00:19:54.110,It looks like our buddy Arrona was a bit of a gambler.
00:19:54.110,00:19:55.945,"Got dog track, jai alai..."
00:19:55.945,00:19:58.572,Probably needed the money to pay off his debts.
00:19:58.572,00:19:59.782,Bookie.
00:20:01.993,00:20:03.243,Oops.
00:20:03.243,00:20:04.787,"Damn, man!"
00:20:04.787,00:20:06.706,Watch where you swinging the dead leg.
00:20:06.706,00:20:08.166,"My bad, my bad."
00:20:08.166,00:20:11.002,Damn this.
00:20:11.002,00:20:12.920,I'm a narcotics cop.
00:20:16.132,00:20:18.009,Dead bodies...
00:20:20.136,00:20:21.512,Dead ends.
00:20:27.685,00:20:28.853,Maggots.
00:20:32.857,00:20:34.525,"What's wrong with you, man?"
00:20:48.622,00:20:50.666,"Hey, what do you say we grab a couple of burritos?"
00:20:53.002,00:20:56.881,"You know, you drive almost slow enough to drive Miss Daisy."
00:20:58.925,00:21:01.969,"Hey, man, the transaction is done."
00:21:01.969,00:21:04.263,"We ain't got shit, so it's over."
00:21:04.263,00:21:07.141,"Relax, man. We got it before, we'll get it again."
00:21:07.141,00:21:09.727,"Yeah, yeah. You got it all figured out, don't you?"
00:21:09.727,00:21:11.562,"Oh, you got to have faith, player."
00:21:11.562,00:21:13.313,"Let me tell you something, all right?"
00:21:13.313,00:21:15.524,"By the time we figured out how, we'd be out of a job."
00:21:15.524,00:21:19.820,"No, scratch that."
00:21:19.820,00:21:21.530,"Oh, but don't worry!"
00:21:21.530,00:21:24.825,They tend to think Mike Lowrey going to be all right.
00:21:24.825,00:21:29.622,Especially since they think you some rich kid playing cop.
00:21:29.622,00:21:32.541,"Look, man, I ain't got no trust fund."
00:21:32.541,00:21:36.045,"Okay, see, for me, no job, no check."
00:21:36.045,00:21:38.839,That's like all the other guys in the unit.
00:21:38.839,00:21:40.424,"At least, most of us."
00:21:40.424,00:21:43.677,So I'm playing cop now?
00:21:43.677,00:21:45.930,This is a game?
00:21:45.930,00:21:48.891,You always wanted to be Starsky or Hutch.
00:21:51.060,00:21:52.561,"You know what, man?"
00:21:52.561,00:21:55.189,I'm so sick of this bullshit.
00:21:55.189,00:21:58.901,"What, I'm supposed to apologize for my family leaving me money?"
00:21:58.901,00:22:01.528,All I ever wanted to be was a cop.
00:22:01.528,00:22:04.198,I get up early and I take it to the max every day.
00:22:04.198,00:22:07.785,I'm the first guy through the door and I'm always the last guy to leave the crime scene.
00:22:07.785,00:22:10.163,So you know what?
00:22:10.163,00:22:13.373,And fuck anybody who got a problem with Mike Lowrey!
00:22:15.417,00:22:18.087,"I love you, man."
00:22:20.840,00:22:22.382,I do.
00:22:22.382,00:22:24.010,"You're cool, man."
00:22:24.010,00:22:26.386,You're my partner.
00:22:26.386,00:22:28.055,Slow-ass driver.
00:22:28.055,00:22:30.975,You driving like a bitch.
00:22:30.975,00:22:33.227,Slow-ass.
00:22:33.227,00:22:35.855,"I'll take me and you off this fucking cliff, if you keep fucking with me."
00:22:35.855,00:22:37.523,All right?
00:22:35.855,00:22:39.192,"Then it would be, what, two bitches in the sea?"
00:22:39.192,00:22:41.902,Is that what you want?
00:22:41.902,00:22:44.322,My wife know I ain't no bitch.
00:22:45.781,00:22:47.491,I'm a bad boy.
00:22:47.491,00:22:51.453,"Bad boys, bad boys."
00:22:51.453,00:22:54.248,What you gonna do when they come for you?
00:22:54.248,00:22:56.542,"Shelly, only models and that's all."
00:22:56.542,00:22:59.170,Max just dropped by.
00:23:01.255,00:23:05.051,What's this that you want me to call around looking for the newly rich?
00:23:05.051,00:23:09.180,"Are there any new guys partying a lot, spending a lot of money?"
00:23:09.180,00:23:15.393,"Actually, this guy called me this morning, desperate, every two hours, looking for new girls in town. Are you available this afternoon?"
00:23:15.393,00:23:17.271,It'll be a quick $2000.
00:23:17.271,00:23:18.564,I've got plans with Julie.
00:23:18.564,00:23:20.816,"She's your roommate, right?"
00:23:20.816,00:23:23.194,"So bring her. She's cute, she's sexy, go on."
00:23:23.194,00:23:25.071,"She's not a working girl, Lois."
00:23:25.071,00:23:26.947,Doesn't matter.
00:23:26.947,00:23:29.367,He's probably so messed up he can't even get it up.
00:23:29.367,00:23:31.535,"Well, all right, maybe we'll go check it out."
00:23:31.535,00:23:34.496,Could be the party I'm looking for.
00:23:34.496,00:23:37.208,JULIE: A party at the Biltmore?
00:23:37.208,00:23:39.710,"MAX: Okay, Julie, I owe you one."
00:23:39.710,00:23:43.881,Forget about it. I'll just deduct it from the hundreds of favors I already owe you.
00:23:43.881,00:23:46.133,Am I turning into the guest that won't leave?
00:23:46.133,00:23:48.468,"No, I like having you live with me."
00:23:48.468,00:23:51.764,JULIE: I'm an out-of-work photographer who doesn't know how to cook.
00:23:51.764,00:23:54.392,"I mean, not a big upside for you there."
00:23:54.392,00:23:58.396,"So, what incredibly hip individual inspired this little visit to the Biltmore?"
00:23:58.396,00:24:00.814,It's a favor for Mike Lowrey.
00:24:00.814,00:24:04.110,"Oh, right. The cop who I think you're just maybe a little bit in love with."
00:24:04.110,00:24:07.863,"Well, maybe I am."
00:24:07.863,00:24:11.284,"And if I were ever in trouble, he's the only person I'd call."
00:24:11.284,00:24:14.452,"I know, I know. I think I've heard this before."
00:24:15.662,00:24:18.582,Hello.
00:24:18.582,00:24:21.043,You must be Max.
00:24:21.043,00:24:23.003,I'm Eddie.
00:24:23.003,00:24:25.339,To the Al Capone suite.
00:24:25.339,00:24:28.634,So I guess we're a little early.
00:24:28.634,00:24:30.468,This is my friend Julie.
00:24:30.468,00:24:32.012,Julie.
00:24:32.012,00:24:33.222,Hi.
00:24:33.222,00:24:36.100,"You like Al Capone, don't you?"
00:24:36.100,00:24:38.060,I hadn't really thought about it much.
00:24:39.728,00:24:42.648,I'm not kidding about this being Capone's.
00:24:42.648,00:24:46.902,He had the place rigged with secret passageways.
00:24:46.902,00:24:49.238,"Ten minutes, we're out of here."
00:24:49.238,00:24:50.572,Julie. One drink.
00:24:50.572,00:24:51.907,EDDIE: What's the whispering about?
00:24:51.907,00:24:53.242,One sip.
00:24:54.492,00:24:56.120,Just girl chat.
00:24:56.120,00:24:58.538,Where's the bathroom?
00:24:58.538,00:25:00.416,Upstairs on your right.
00:25:01.375,00:25:03.085,Watch your step.
00:25:04.670,00:25:06.504,Come.
00:25:06.504,00:25:08.382,Sit.
00:25:08.382,00:25:10.676,EDDIE: Enjoy yourself. Relax.
00:25:10.676,00:25:14.096,Eddie's got some favors to play with.
00:25:14.096,00:25:15.889,"MAX: Yes, that he does."
00:25:15.889,00:25:18.767,I should've told you sooner about Eddie's private party.
00:25:18.767,00:25:21.687,"Well, now it's a surprise party."
00:25:28.694,00:25:32.948,"Okay, Max, I think we've been here about five minutes too long."
00:25:38.287,00:25:42.208,"I see you treat yourself well, Eddie."
00:25:42.208,00:25:44.335,Yeah.
00:25:46.212,00:25:49.547,"I needed to blow off a little steam after the, uh..."
00:25:49.547,00:25:51.717,"The move, you know."
00:25:51.717,00:25:55.388,"A little party with a couple friends, you know how it is, that's all."
00:25:55.388,00:25:58.265,I was going to invite you guys.
00:25:58.265,00:25:59.557,Invite?
00:25:59.557,00:26:01.768,Looks like I'm catering this.
00:26:03.687,00:26:07.400,"I was looking for my 2 keys of dope, and now I know where they are."
00:26:07.400,00:26:09.818,"Yours? Man, it's our score."
00:26:12.446,00:26:14.865,And the girl?
00:26:14.865,00:26:16.325,Just entertainment.
00:26:16.325,00:26:19.995,Hi. I'm Max.
00:26:21.914,00:26:26.043,I like a woman who takes pride in her appearance.
00:26:28.045,00:26:30.506,Don't you?
00:26:30.506,00:26:34.218,"Yeah, I hate when a bitch lets herself slide."
00:26:34.218,00:26:38.847,You look like a model in that dress.
00:26:46.272,00:26:49.066,"Oh, great."
00:27:16.051,00:27:19.305,"FOUCHET: You were a cop for so long, you should know hookers talk."
00:27:19.305,00:27:22.433,You couldn't wait four more days until I made the deal?
00:27:22.433,00:27:24.642,I can't work with that kind of stupidity!
00:27:24.642,00:27:26.312,EDDIE: Stupidity?
00:27:26.312,00:27:28.730,I got you connected inside.
00:27:29.815,00:27:32.401,I brought you my family.
00:27:32.401,00:27:34.069,Eddie.
00:27:35.446,00:27:36.780,It's my family now.
00:27:38.073,00:27:40.909,"EDDIE: Fouchet, we're still friends."
00:27:40.909,00:27:43.870,What are you guys doing?
00:27:47.207,00:27:49.418,CASPER: Use a smaller gun.
00:27:49.418,00:27:51.545,Hey. Somebody's up there! Upstairs!
00:27:54.340,00:27:56.175,"CASPER: Get her! Move, Fergie."
00:28:01.013,00:28:02.848,Get her!
00:28:12.816,00:28:14.234,What the fuck?
00:28:32.628,00:28:34.505,CASPER: Shoot her!
00:28:52.022,00:28:53.815,I got her.
00:28:53.815,00:28:57.236,"Bullshit, I got her."
00:28:57.236,00:28:59.446,I can't believe she made it!
00:28:59.446,00:29:01.407,Jesus!
00:29:01.407,00:29:05.077,She jumped.
00:29:05.077,00:29:08.706,"Find out who she worked for, and find out where she lives."
00:29:18.924,00:29:22.302,It's about fucking time!
00:29:22.302,00:29:26.306,Come here. Come here.
00:29:26.306,00:29:27.766,"He's dead, right?"
00:29:27.766,00:29:30.143,Look familiar?
00:29:30.143,00:29:32.312,The ex-cop.
00:29:32.312,00:29:34.814,And there's some of our high-grade heroin over there.
00:29:34.814,00:29:37.776,There's a headline Sinclair's gonna love.
00:29:37.776,00:29:39.945,"HOWARD: Look, there's no signs of forced entry."
00:29:39.945,00:29:42.406,What the fuck is all this?
00:29:42.406,00:29:44.700,It's the Al Capone suite.
00:29:44.700,00:29:47.119,What can I say?
00:29:47.119,00:29:48.995,It's a shitty day.
00:29:48.995,00:29:50.497,Real shitty day.
00:29:50.497,00:29:53.875,"Looks like we got over here, gentlemen."
00:29:53.875,00:29:55.961,"Seems to me, somebody's missing from the party."
00:29:55.961,00:29:58.130,"All right, listen to me."
00:29:58.130,00:30:01.508,Your only function in life right now is to find that person. You find her.
00:30:01.508,00:30:03.636,It's the only good lead we got all day. You find her.
00:30:03.636,00:30:06.722,"Look, man."
00:30:17.441,00:30:19.610,"MIKE: Hey, what you got over there, partner?"
00:30:30.663,00:30:32.247,Cover her.
00:30:35.584,00:30:37.544,"HOWARD: He knew the girl, huh?"
00:30:50.182,00:30:52.225,"Look, man."
00:30:52.225,00:30:55.771,"All right, we'll get the witness and the fools who did this."
00:30:55.771,00:30:57.189,Yeah.
00:30:55.771,00:30:58.440,"Listen, why don't you see if you can catch a ride with Howard?"
00:30:58.440,00:31:00.693,Whoa.
00:31:00.693,00:31:03.487,"Eight calls were made to Lois Fields, that's who Max used to work for."
00:31:03.487,00:31:04.822,So I'm gonna check it out.
00:31:04.822,00:31:06.198,"All right, well, I'll come with you."
00:31:06.198,00:31:08.659,"No, why don't we just catch up later."
00:31:08.659,00:31:09.827,You okay?
00:31:10.952,00:31:12.287,I'm cool.
00:31:20.045,00:31:24.633,Hello? Hello? Hello?
00:31:28.136,00:31:29.346,Shit!
00:31:33.851,00:31:38.021,"Yeah, baby. Look, baby, I know quality time was my idea."
00:31:38.021,00:31:40.232,Don't talk to me about quality time.
00:31:40.232,00:31:41.775,"Hold on, babe."
00:31:41.775,00:31:44.528,"Look here, I need a full file on Eddie Dominguez."
00:31:44.528,00:31:46.071,MAN: That will take a minute.
00:31:46.071,00:31:48.490,THERESA: I got on the red one.
00:31:48.490,00:31:52.452,You have on the red one?
00:31:52.452,00:31:54.329,"You're never home, baby."
00:31:54.329,00:31:56.790,MAN: All his files are blocked.
00:31:56.790,00:32:00.627,"Hey, I don't give a damn about his personal files."
00:32:00.627,00:32:02.337,"MAN: Screw you, that's illegal."
00:32:02.337,00:32:04.005,"No, screw you!"
00:32:05.632,00:32:07.593,"THERESA: Marcus, are you talking to me?"
00:32:07.593,00:32:09.553,"No, I'm not talking to no..."
00:32:09.553,00:32:12.681,"It's a term you use, baby."
00:32:12.681,00:32:14.725,You ain't screwing nothing!
00:32:14.725,00:32:16.518,Goddamn it!
00:32:20.021,00:32:22.023,HOWARD: Where's Lowrey?
00:32:22.023,00:32:23.817,I just paged him.
00:32:23.817,00:32:26.403,He's following up this Lois Fields lead.
00:32:26.403,00:32:27.780,The madam?
00:32:42.920,00:32:46.047,"21-2, request backup."
00:32:46.047,00:32:48.717,"21-2, backup. Reach Road."
00:33:21.708,00:33:22.918,That might be him.
00:33:25.170,00:33:27.088,"Yeah, Lowrey's desk."
00:33:27.088,00:33:29.925,I need to talk to Detective Mike Lowrey.
00:33:29.925,00:33:32.093,This is Captain Howard.
00:33:32.093,00:33:34.847,You can get me Detective Lowrey.
00:33:34.847,00:33:36.890,"Look, this is not another paternity case is it?"
00:33:36.890,00:33:39.977,"No, it's another murder case, you twerp!"
00:33:39.977,00:33:42.729,You're talking about the murder case at the Biltmore Hotel tonight?
00:33:42.729,00:33:47.901,"Listen, I've just seen my best friend get murdered."
00:33:47.901,00:33:50.320,And I'll only talk to Mike Lowrey.
00:33:50.320,00:33:52.781,Why only Mike Lowrey?
00:33:52.781,00:33:57.202,"None of your fucking business, all right? Either Lowrey or I'm gonna blow town."
00:33:57.202,00:33:59.913,"Mike, phone! Telephone!"
00:33:59.913,00:34:03.208,He's coming right now.
00:34:03.208,00:34:05.502,Talk to her.
00:34:05.502,00:34:08.421,Talk to her.
00:34:08.421,00:34:11.508,"Yeah, he just got out of the john. Hold on."
00:34:11.508,00:34:13.051,Talk to her now or she's gonna walk.
00:34:13.051,00:34:14.761,"Captain, I can't be no Mike, man."
00:34:14.761,00:34:16.388,Just talk to her.
00:34:16.388,00:34:18.473,This is our witness.
00:34:24.062,00:34:26.023,Hello.
00:34:26.023,00:34:28.191,This is Mike Lowrey.
00:34:28.191,00:34:30.569,He doesn't talk that way.
00:34:30.569,00:34:33.363,Try to talk sexy.
00:34:33.363,00:34:35.114,Captain!
00:34:35.114,00:34:36.366,Damn!
00:34:38.451,00:34:42.121,You don't know me.
00:34:42.121,00:34:44.624,And I was Max Logan's best friend.
00:34:44.624,00:34:46.710,"Okay, whoa, calm down, calm down."
00:34:46.710,00:34:48.420,Talk to me now.
00:34:49.963,00:34:51.631,Yeah.
00:34:51.631,00:34:55.134,And she said if she ever needed anything...
00:34:57.178,00:34:59.264,I need your help.
00:34:59.264,00:35:00.891,Give me the address.
00:35:00.891,00:35:02.768,All right. Okay.
00:35:02.768,00:35:05.353,It's gonna be all right.
00:35:05.353,00:35:07.146,I'm on the way.
00:35:07.146,00:35:09.315,Let me see if I can find Lowrey.
00:35:09.315,00:35:10.525,But you gotta go! Go.
00:35:10.525,00:35:12.903,"Get Mike down here, man."
00:35:12.903,00:35:15.822,Go now. Get out of the chair!
00:35:15.822,00:35:18.283,You won't see your wife for a month! Get out of the chair!
00:35:31.463,00:35:33.381,Get this fucking door fixed!
00:35:40.806,00:35:42.682,Mike Lowrey.
00:35:42.682,00:35:45.978,"No, easy."
00:35:47.604,00:35:49.230,Shit!
00:35:49.230,00:35:51.483,Who's there?
00:35:51.483,00:35:54.653,Mike Lowrey.
00:35:54.653,00:35:56.780,How do I know it's Mike Lowrey?
00:35:56.780,00:35:59.365,"Because, I'm Mike Lowrey!"
00:35:59.365,00:36:01.242,"Okay, now we ain't got much time."
00:36:01.242,00:36:04.037,Hold your badge up to the peephole.
00:36:04.037,00:36:06.581,I'm not letting you in until you do.
00:36:14.547,00:36:16.257,No way!
00:36:18.093,00:36:20.679,What the fuck was that for?
00:36:20.679,00:36:23.473,What you mean I ain't Mike Lowrey? You've never even met him... Me!
00:36:23.473,00:36:26.101,Max described you differently!
00:36:27.435,00:36:28.770,Prove it!
00:36:28.770,00:36:30.689,Okay.
00:36:30.689,00:36:32.649,I helped her brother get out of jail.
00:36:32.649,00:36:35.068,"Yeah, so?"
00:36:32.649,00:36:38.488,"I mean, you know, I was cool like that, little bump and grind..."
00:36:38.488,00:36:39.823,Wrong!
00:36:41.033,00:36:43.076,Give me the bat!
00:36:43.076,00:36:46.245,You wanna go at this? Fine!
00:36:46.245,00:36:47.914,You go at this shit alone!
00:36:49.708,00:36:52.293,"Oh, I forgot."
00:36:52.293,00:36:57.132,"The bad guys probably know where you live, which means they're coming for your ass. Good luck!"
00:37:00.052,00:37:01.761,I saw the whole thing.
00:37:03.055,00:37:05.724,I watched them shoot her like she was nothing.
00:37:08.894,00:37:10.812,"Please, shut the door."
00:37:15.775,00:37:17.903,"Look, lady."
00:37:17.903,00:37:23.366,"You ain't got no more bats, golf clubs, or anything like that you can swing at me, do you?"
00:37:25.202,00:37:27.370,"I knew Max, okay?"
00:37:27.370,00:37:30.248,I cared about Max also.
00:37:31.457,00:37:33.543,I'm just here to help you.
00:37:36.504,00:37:39.424,You're not what I expected.
00:37:39.424,00:37:42.886,"Yeah, well, I ain't expect to walk into Yankee Stadium either."
00:37:45.263,00:37:49.267,"Okay, now, we got to get out of here, okay? Let's go."
00:37:49.267,00:37:51.394,I've got to get my dogs.
00:37:52.812,00:37:54.522,"Lukie, Dukie, whatever!"
00:37:54.522,00:37:56.691,"Look, you got a back door?"
00:37:56.691,00:37:59.986,Where we going?
00:37:59.986,00:38:02.864,"Well, fuck that!"
00:38:02.864,00:38:05.700,That was a cop back at the Biltmore.
00:38:05.700,00:38:08.870,"Former cop, okay?"
00:38:08.870,00:38:11.206,"Luke, come on, Luke!"
00:38:11.206,00:38:14.042,"Listen, lady, if you want to live, you ain't got no choice, you got to trust me."
00:38:32.811,00:38:35.480,MARCUS: Run! Run! Move!
00:38:46.992,00:38:49.869,JULIE: Get my dog! Get my dog!
00:38:49.869,00:38:51.496,Jesus Christ!
00:38:51.496,00:38:52.914,Who the hell was that?
00:38:54.082,00:38:56.751,There is too much killing going on!
00:38:56.751,00:38:58.461,Go after them!
00:38:58.461,00:38:59.754,I'll go around front!
00:39:02.299,00:39:05.593,"MARCUS: Come on. Come on, move your ass! Let's go!"
00:39:09.139,00:39:10.431,Fuck!
00:39:21.567,00:39:23.820,Get in the car!
00:39:23.820,00:39:25.655,Damn it!
00:39:29.201,00:39:32.453,"JULIE: Go, goddamn it!"
00:39:32.453,00:39:34.789,"Go, goddamn it, go!"
00:39:41.796,00:39:44.966,How did you miss them?
00:39:44.966,00:39:46.551,"Watch your fucking mouth, will you!"
00:39:46.551,00:39:48.803,Lose some weight and you would have caught them.
00:39:48.803,00:39:51.472,"I'd like to come over and squeeze your little fucking head, you bastard."
00:39:51.472,00:39:53.558,You're in trouble.
00:39:53.558,00:39:56.061,You get the license plate?
00:39:56.061,00:39:57.562,You cockeyed fuck!
00:39:58.646,00:40:01.816,This is your goddamn getaway car?
00:40:01.816,00:40:04.069,What is this? A goddamn family station wagon?
00:40:04.069,00:40:07.405,"Oh, my God, you got..."
00:40:07.405,00:40:10.491,"It's an undercover car, okay?"
00:40:10.491,00:40:15.121,Shit. I know they got a look at my license plate. Were those the guys who shot Max?
00:40:15.121,00:40:16.664,What guys?
00:40:16.664,00:40:18.750,You tell me what they looked like.
00:40:18.750,00:40:21.836,I don't know. I was too busy trying to keep a bullet out of your ass.
00:40:21.836,00:40:24.964,"Look, Julie."
00:40:21.836,00:40:27.008,I'm gonna need you to look through some mug shots until you can identify Max's shooter.
00:40:27.008,00:40:29.177,Where are we gonna do that?
00:40:29.177,00:40:32.347,"No way! I told you, I am not going into protective custody!"
00:40:32.347,00:40:33.765,"Look, lady, I'm not playing."
00:40:33.765,00:40:35.516,"Okay, you really pissing me off."
00:40:35.516,00:40:37.435,"Now, I'll book your narrow ass!"
00:40:37.435,00:40:39.437,"Oh, yeah?"
00:40:39.437,00:40:42.232,I feel a little case of it coming on right now.
00:40:42.232,00:40:45.026,"Fine, lady, where would you feel safe?"
00:40:45.026,00:40:47.486,You want to do protective custody?
00:40:47.486,00:40:50.282,We'll do in-home protective custody at your place.
00:40:50.282,00:40:52.533,All right? I can handle going to your place.
00:40:52.533,00:40:55.120,"Yeah, my place."
00:40:55.120,00:40:56.537,No way.
00:40:57.997,00:40:59.916,Right.
00:40:59.916,00:41:02.877,My place... Yeah.
00:41:02.877,00:41:05.713,Mike Lowrey's place.
00:41:05.713,00:41:09.175,That's the best idea you came up with tonight.
00:41:12.511,00:41:13.930,Wait here.
00:41:13.930,00:41:15.723,Wait here.
00:41:21.229,00:41:22.521,Detective Burnett!
00:41:22.521,00:41:24.523,How are you?
00:41:24.523,00:41:26.025,"Mr. Lowrey, he's not here."
00:41:26.025,00:41:27.819,I know. He said I could use his place tonight.
00:41:27.819,00:41:30.280,"Oh, really?"
00:41:33.408,00:41:35.952,Who's the chick?
00:41:37.578,00:41:39.872,"Fine, she's fine."
00:41:39.872,00:41:42.334,"And your kids, they're good? Because family's the most important thing."
00:41:42.334,00:41:44.043,Is it?
00:41:44.043,00:41:47.839,Mr. Lowrey told me that you got a real baby factory going on over there at your house.
00:41:47.839,00:41:50.591,Here you go.
00:41:50.591,00:41:53.678,"If that ain't enough, I'm gonna run you in for extortion."
00:41:53.678,00:41:56.055,"You know, I'm so stupid sometimes."
00:41:56.055,00:41:58.057,Are you?
00:41:58.057,00:42:00.518,Mr. Lowrey did mention something about you coming by tonight.
00:42:00.518,00:42:03.396,What did he say?
00:42:03.396,00:42:04.647,Hang out.
00:42:05.815,00:42:07.108,Here you go.
00:42:07.108,00:42:08.485,Yeah. You're hurting me.
00:42:08.485,00:42:12.530,Thank you.
00:42:12.530,00:42:15.408,Have fun.
00:42:15.408,00:42:18.244,"Sure, sure."
00:42:23.082,00:42:24.417,"MARCUS: Yeah, come on."
00:42:24.417,00:42:27.003,Watch your step up through here.
00:42:27.003,00:42:29.755,"Damn, I must've left some incense burning."
00:42:29.755,00:42:32.633,Welcome to Casa de Lowrey.
00:42:34.052,00:42:36.304,This is kind of...
00:42:36.304,00:42:38.681,I'm always moving my switches.
00:42:38.681,00:42:41.434,"See, I'm always decorating, so sometimes I just don't know where shit is."
00:42:41.434,00:42:44.103,Damn!
00:42:44.103,00:42:45.355,Shit!
00:42:46.731,00:42:48.900,Why am I tripping on shit I know is there?
00:42:51.486,00:42:53.321,"See, you found a light switch."
00:42:53.321,00:42:55.532,I should have known it was there since I decorated the place.
00:42:57.450,00:43:00.495,"Mike, this is Yvette."
00:43:00.495,00:43:02.663,Ignore this.
00:43:02.663,00:43:05.333,"MARCUS: She's always calling, got to have it."
00:43:05.333,00:43:08.669,"Don't call here no more now, freak! Just one of my freaks."
00:43:08.669,00:43:10.505,JULIE: All of this on a cop's salary?
00:43:10.505,00:43:11.964,"YVETTE: ...right now, on the table."
00:43:11.964,00:43:14.759,"MARCUS: Uh, well, it's honest money."
00:43:14.759,00:43:17.678,I'm a second-generation rich kid.
00:43:17.678,00:43:22.058,"So if you're not in it for the pay check, what are you, some kind of action junkie?"
00:43:22.058,00:43:24.477,If that's what you want to call it.
00:43:24.477,00:43:28.856,"I don't mind bats swung at my head, bullets damn near grazing my ass."
00:43:28.856,00:43:31.025,Gives me a rush.
00:43:31.025,00:43:34.404,"Look, let me give you a broad stroke of the place."
00:43:34.404,00:43:37.740,I got some T-bones in the fridge for Lukie and Dukie...
00:43:37.740,00:43:43.371,"Sorry, your fridge is this way. I confuse my own shit."
00:43:43.371,00:43:47.292,"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
00:43:47.292,00:43:49.210,"Yeah, I gotta get back to the P.D."
00:43:49.210,00:43:52.755,"These are Miami's peak crime hours, you know."
00:43:52.755,00:43:55.258,Apparently.
00:43:55.258,00:43:59.762,"You know, they said that this deal was going down in four days, and I'm..."
00:43:59.762,00:44:03.433,"You know, obviously seem to be kind of a major glitch in their..."
00:44:03.433,00:44:05.310,Hey.
00:44:05.310,00:44:08.687,You ain't with the bad guys now. You're with the cops.
00:44:08.687,00:44:11.524,With Mike Lowrey.
00:44:11.524,00:44:14.360,Everything's gonna be all right. Trust me.
00:44:14.360,00:44:16.446,I'll be back.
00:44:16.446,00:44:21.117,"I know that it's no time to joke, but remember in the movie when..."
00:44:21.117,00:44:23.869,"All right, all right."
00:44:23.869,00:44:26.164,"Thanks for everything, Mike."
00:44:27.665,00:44:29.083,I'm gonna go.
00:44:33.379,00:44:35.298,Chet.
00:44:35.298,00:44:36.924,CHET: That was quick.
00:44:36.924,00:44:38.343,"It's not like that, Chet, okay?"
00:44:38.343,00:44:40.637,"The girl, she's a witness."
00:44:40.637,00:44:42.639,I need you to keep an eye out.
00:44:42.639,00:44:44.599,"All right, now listen to me. Hear me."
00:44:44.599,00:44:46.809,Me? Okay.
00:44:46.809,00:44:51.439,"All right, the moment Lowrey gets in, you have him call me at home."
00:44:51.439,00:44:53.024,Call you at home.
00:44:53.024,00:44:55.443,Use this phone.
00:44:55.443,00:44:58.070,Don't let him upstairs?
00:44:58.070,00:44:59.822,I could lose my job.
00:44:59.822,00:45:02.699,"Chet, trust me on this, okay?"
00:45:02.699,00:45:04.743,Don't let him up.
00:45:04.743,00:45:06.579,Important witness.
00:45:06.579,00:45:08.247,Thank you.
00:45:08.247,00:45:10.249,I got a better idea. I'm getting off in two hours.
00:45:10.249,00:45:12.960,"If you want, I could go upstairs and watch the door."
00:45:12.960,00:45:15.254,"You know, like cops do in the movies. Sit on the stool."
00:45:15.254,00:45:17.173,I got a magazine and everything.
00:45:17.173,00:45:19.300,And I don't let anybody in or out.
00:45:19.300,00:45:22.512,"Seriously. All kidding aside, I want to help."
00:45:22.512,00:45:24.180,You're helping.
00:45:24.180,00:45:27.392,Can you do it from here?
00:45:27.392,00:45:30.603,Fine. That helps.
00:45:30.603,00:45:34.065,"It's funny that you ask me, I was going to be a cop."
00:45:34.065,00:45:35.650,I took the test and everything.
00:45:35.650,00:45:37.527,"You know, just didn't work out."
00:45:37.527,00:45:39.278,Politics.
00:45:39.278,00:45:42.407,Yeah. I know.
00:45:42.407,00:45:45.868,From here.
00:45:45.868,00:45:47.912,"Take care, chief."
00:45:47.912,00:45:49.414,I'm a deputy.
00:45:49.414,00:45:53.209,"Don't honey-baby me, you smell like perfume."
00:45:55.211,00:45:58.047,And you don't even have your wedding ring on!
00:45:59.674,00:46:01.259,Damn!
00:46:02.468,00:46:07.890,"I went undercover, and so it required taking off the ring for a second."
00:46:07.890,00:46:13.854,"I got the ring. Look, I just put my hand in my pocket because that's where it was, and it's right back on, baby."
00:46:15.607,00:46:17.400,Damn!
00:46:17.400,00:46:19.360,Can I get a pillow?
00:46:19.360,00:46:23.364,"Well, if it isn't the guy who doesn't return phone calls."
00:46:23.364,00:46:26.117,You mind telling me where the hell you been the last 12 hours?
00:46:26.117,00:46:28.119,Huh? I been paging you all night!
00:46:28.119,00:46:31.163,We got a situation here that I think you need to know about.
00:46:31.163,00:46:36.544,"Look, Marcus, I got a dead madam, I got a concussion and I got a real bad headache."
00:46:36.544,00:46:37.962,You got a headache.
00:46:37.962,00:46:39.380,"Well, let me tell you what I did last night."
00:46:39.380,00:46:41.299,I had to sleep on my couch.
00:46:41.299,00:46:43.842,I wake up this morning and I got a Power Ranger stuck up my ass.
00:46:43.842,00:46:47.846,"And while we're discussing my ass, I damn near got it blown off."
00:46:47.846,00:46:50.933,Guess what the good news is. I got a witness.
00:46:50.933,00:46:53.227,Marcus. Marcus.
00:46:53.227,00:46:57.064,Shh. You sound like a nagging wife.
00:46:57.064,00:46:59.108,I'm a nagging...
00:46:59.108,00:47:02.612,You see what happens when you go off without me?
00:47:02.612,00:47:05.573,"Oh, please, like shit don't happen when you're there."
00:47:05.573,00:47:07.950,"That ain't the point, okay?"
00:47:07.950,00:47:12.037,"The point is, if your partner pages you, you might wanna get back to your partner."
00:47:12.037,00:47:14.624,I want to meet the man who whupped your ass.
00:47:14.624,00:47:17.794,I want to meet who whupped Shaft's ass.
00:47:17.794,00:47:19.462,"Look at me, man."
00:47:19.462,00:47:21.506,"Last night, you don't know what I've been through."
00:47:21.506,00:47:25.217,My wife done kicked me out the house. Kicked me out of a happy home.
00:47:25.217,00:47:27.844,"But, no. You got to go off by yourself."
00:47:27.844,00:47:31.015,"I got this, partner, I got this. Bullshit."
00:47:32.266,00:47:34.811,I am feeling much better though. Thank you.
00:47:34.811,00:47:36.103,And I'm gonna get his ass.
00:47:38.939,00:47:40.733,MARCUS: Watch yourself.
00:47:40.733,00:47:43.860,What did I say?
00:47:43.860,00:47:47.198,I heard what I said because I was standing there when I said it.
00:47:47.198,00:47:52.911,"I told you. I told you to secure a witness, not to shoot up a neighborhood."
00:47:52.911,00:47:57.750,Not to do another dead body.
00:47:57.750,00:48:01.379,"Look, captain. This situation is getting out of control."
00:48:01.379,00:48:03.631,You're goddamn right it's getting out of control!
00:48:03.631,00:48:07.926,"Look, man, I damn near had to pass a pop quiz before she believed I was him."
00:48:09.220,00:48:10.722,"HOWARD: Going, it's going..."
00:48:10.722,00:48:13.182,"Shit, little off."
00:48:13.182,00:48:16.060,"I haven't killed anybody yet today, captain."
00:48:16.060,00:48:19.522,Do you want me to yell at you?
00:48:19.522,00:48:23.442,"This witness, it's the only good news I got."
00:48:23.442,00:48:25.319,You guys are bad news.
00:48:25.319,00:48:28.531,"So, what does that mean?"
00:48:25.319,00:48:32.159,"That means if you have to be Mike Lowrey, Santa Claus, I don't give a shit, that's what you're gonna be!"
00:48:32.159,00:48:35.037,"Whoa, whoa, wait a minute."
00:48:37.498,00:48:39.916,"I was, like, getting them all in before you showed up."
00:48:39.916,00:48:44.004,"Can somebody talk to me, please?"
00:48:44.004,00:48:48.384,"Captain, these fools could have gotten a look at my license plate last night."
00:48:48.384,00:48:50.177,So where's the girl now?
00:48:52.388,00:48:54.265,His place.
00:48:54.265,00:48:58.060,You left her by herself?
00:48:58.060,00:49:00.354,You left a strange hooker alone in my apartment?
00:49:00.354,00:49:04.024,"The girl is not a hooker, as far as I know."
00:49:04.024,00:49:08.613,"I had to stash her somewhere. Her and her dogs, Luke and Dukie."
00:49:08.613,00:49:12.575,You left dogs in my house?
00:49:12.575,00:49:15.286,"How about you just add some chimps, okay?"
00:49:15.286,00:49:17.246,Didn't I just say she wasn't a hooker?
00:49:17.246,00:49:19.206,Can you please...
00:49:21.041,00:49:24.211,"For years, Sinclair has been up my ass, trying to pin something on me."
00:49:24.211,00:49:26.923,I'm always taking it for you.
00:49:30.426,00:49:35.222,"Now, if we get this witness to ID the shooters, maybe we catch our bad guys."
00:49:35.222,00:49:40.185,"But until then, until then, you are Mike Lowrey."
00:49:40.185,00:49:42.521,"You be him, you're him."
00:49:42.521,00:49:44.148,You're him!
00:49:44.148,00:49:46.525,And you! You be you.
00:49:46.525,00:49:49.821,But not in front of her!
00:49:55.075,00:49:59.246,"Can we get a time-out here, cap? What am I, like, the designated homeless?"
00:49:59.246,00:50:03.584,Hey. Does it look like I care?
00:50:03.584,00:50:05.670,What did she say to you?
00:50:05.670,00:50:09.340,The shooters are gonna make their drop in four days?
00:50:09.340,00:50:12.343,"Captain, what kind of plan is that?"
00:50:12.343,00:50:14.553,I can't be shacked up with that woman.
00:50:14.553,00:50:18.307,I have a family to look after.
00:50:18.307,00:50:21.143,"You don't like your job, quit."
00:50:23.771,00:50:25.063,Damn!
00:50:26.691,00:50:29.276,"Look, I'll stay at the house with Theresa and the kids."
00:50:29.276,00:50:34.198,"Thank you. But no, thanks, okay? You won't last five minutes with my family."
00:50:34.198,00:50:36.534,"Please, man."
00:50:36.534,00:50:38.619,You only got one woman to satisfy.
00:50:40.371,00:50:43.457,"MARCUS: Yo, man, we ain't the Cosbys."
00:50:43.457,00:50:45.960,"Let's go, I got this."
00:50:45.960,00:50:47.294,Go.
00:50:49.881,00:50:52.299,Everybody wants to be like Mike.
00:50:52.299,00:50:55.594,"Yeah, and you're going to be retired like him too."
00:50:55.594,00:50:57.722,I'd have dunked it on your ass.
00:50:58.931,00:51:02.100,Cleveland? I have never...
00:51:02.100,00:51:05.354,"Hey, look, woman, okay?"
00:51:05.354,00:51:06.939,It's a federal subpoena.
00:51:06.939,00:51:08.566,"What am I gonna do, tell them no?"
00:51:08.566,00:51:10.192,"I don't know what you're gonna tell them, baby."
00:51:10.192,00:51:12.570,Why can't he go?
00:51:12.570,00:51:16.490,"Oh, you know, I wanted to, but Captain Howard said, you know, I'm irresponsi..."
00:51:16.490,00:51:20.285,"No, he said, loose cannon."
00:51:20.285,00:51:22.329,Just out of nowhere sometimes.
00:51:22.329,00:51:23.956,"Mike! No, man."
00:51:23.956,00:51:27.501,Please.
00:51:27.501,00:51:30.755,"Look, babe, okay?"
00:51:30.755,00:51:32.464,I can handle it.
00:51:32.464,00:51:37.511,"MARCUS: I know you can handle it, but I'm worrying about me."
00:51:37.511,00:51:40.723,Take care of y'all.
00:51:40.723,00:51:43.726,THERESA: Who's gonna pick the kids up from day care and all that stuff?
00:51:43.726,00:51:45.227,Mike can't do it.
00:51:45.227,00:51:47.354,"Are you listening to me, baby?"
00:51:47.354,00:51:51.442,"Hey, I read a book that could probably help y'all."
00:51:51.442,00:51:54.486,"Mike, please, man."
00:51:54.486,00:51:56.697,Please.
00:51:58.449,00:51:59.992,Y'all want something?
00:52:01.326,00:52:03.495,"Bring me a Coke, Mike."
00:52:03.495,00:52:05.247,"I'm fine, thank you."
00:52:05.247,00:52:07.332,Mike.
00:52:12.964,00:52:17.927,"So explain it to me, Elliot."
00:52:17.927,00:52:19.637,It's not a chemistry set.
00:52:19.637,00:52:22.431,"He knows it ain't a chemistry set, asshole."
00:52:27.103,00:52:28.646,"So, what is it?"
00:52:28.646,00:52:31.398,The cutting agent is a highly volatile...
00:52:31.398,00:52:32.775,substance.
00:52:32.775,00:52:34.652,The ether...
00:52:34.652,00:52:36.737,I don't care! I don't care!
00:52:36.737,00:52:40.032,"I'm not a fucking chemistry teacher, Elliot."
00:52:40.032,00:52:41.951,"So, what is the problem?"
00:52:41.951,00:52:44.954,The problem is that there's too much moisture down here.
00:52:44.954,00:52:47.999,"Yeah, it's totally fucked."
00:52:48.916,00:52:50.042,Okay.
00:52:50.042,00:52:52.003,"So, what else?"
00:52:52.003,00:52:54.421,ELLIOT: It's taking longer to cook than we originally planned.
00:52:54.421,00:52:57.424,"And if we rush it, we're gonna have a lot of drugs that we can't sell."
00:52:57.424,00:53:02.054,You're fucking with my timetable here. I gave you a deadline. You understand?
00:53:02.054,00:53:04.431,Do you understand?
00:53:06.892,00:53:08.853,MARCUS: Julie!
00:53:08.853,00:53:10.855,JULIE: Yeah.
00:53:12.272,00:53:13.858,Oh.
00:53:13.858,00:53:15.860,Hi.
00:53:15.860,00:53:18.779,"Yeah, I am."
00:53:18.779,00:53:25.119,"Look, we gotta go through some mug shots. So I'm gonna hook into the computer, and we can do this."
00:53:23.742,00:53:27.121,"Hey, Mike, who's the guy in all the photographs?"
00:53:29.540,00:53:34.336,Sometimes I don't even look at my shelf and I forgot all the pictures was here.
00:53:34.336,00:53:39.133,That's my partner.
00:53:39.133,00:53:41.886,I've never seen anything like this before.
00:53:41.886,00:53:44.471,"Well, I can see how it may throw you a little bit."
00:53:44.471,00:53:46.390,You know what?
00:53:46.390,00:53:50.394,"Yeah, these pictures are up here for every time he saved my life."
00:53:50.394,00:53:54.773,It's the same thing with him.
00:53:54.773,00:53:57.359,Because it's like a shrine. Just a reminder.
00:53:57.359,00:53:59.528,Oh.
00:53:59.528,00:54:05.743,"Because, I mean, when I saw it, the whole wall, I thought maybe they were, you know, pictures of your lover."
00:54:05.743,00:54:07.411,Of who?
00:54:07.411,00:54:09.997,"I thought that... You know, I thought maybe you were gay."
00:54:09.997,00:54:12.166,I was gay?
00:54:12.166,00:54:14.668,"Nah, nah, nah, baby."
00:54:14.668,00:54:19.048,"I mean, I didn't mean to offend you. You know, it's okay to be a homosexual, Mike."
00:54:19.048,00:54:22.968,"No, you're not listening."
00:54:22.968,00:54:27.556,Believe me. Did you sleep in the bed? You didn't feel the dents?
00:54:27.556,00:54:29.307,"Yeah, the dents come from all that."
00:54:29.307,00:54:32.144,That's how I gets down.
00:54:32.144,00:54:34.188,sweet.
00:54:34.188,00:54:38.192,"Gay. Psh. If I was, I'd change the drapes in this motherfucker."
00:54:40.027,00:54:41.195,JULIE: No.
00:54:46.324,00:54:48.535,You want some?
00:54:48.535,00:54:51.163,I don't eat flesh.
00:54:51.163,00:54:52.831,What?
00:54:52.831,00:54:57.377,That's flesh that you're shoveling into your mouth.
00:54:57.377,00:55:01.715,"You know, that was a living, breathing creature, you know."
00:55:03.884,00:55:05.469,It's just bologna.
00:55:05.469,00:55:07.721,My bologna has a first name.
00:55:07.721,00:55:14.645,"Well, actually, your bologna has about 30 names, you know, because they take, like, odd parts from all different ones."
00:55:14.645,00:55:24.571,"You know, like, the leftovers, like the hooves, stomach lining, ears, stuff like that. You know."
00:55:24.571,00:55:29.534,"And then out comes, like, this sheet. That's what you're eating now."
00:55:31.245,00:55:33.497,Okay.
00:55:33.497,00:55:34.957,You know what?
00:55:34.957,00:55:37.876,I don't eat bologna no more.
00:55:37.876,00:55:40.171,Can I eat the pickle?
00:55:40.171,00:55:42.714,"Well, there's a lot of salt in it, but, yeah, it's fine."
00:55:42.714,00:55:44.800,Lot of salt in the pickle?
00:55:44.800,00:55:49.096,"Okay, let me rinse..."
00:55:51.098,00:55:52.641,Hm? How's that?
00:55:52.641,00:55:55.393,Just... Let's keep going.
00:55:55.393,00:55:57.021,I don't even taste the salt now.
00:56:00.816,00:56:02.026,Go back. Go back.
00:56:08.782,00:56:10.159,That's the guy.
00:56:10.159,00:56:12.368,"He was there, in the room."
00:56:12.368,00:56:16.957,"We got a tip they was running some major druggage in there, something like 50 keys."
00:56:16.957,00:56:18.917,So we steps to the door. Boom!
00:56:18.917,00:56:22.213,Freeze! Miami P.D.!
00:56:22.213,00:56:26.508,"Out of nowhere, this little crazy pimp named Chino punched me in the head with some brass knuckles."
00:56:26.508,00:56:28.219,"So I'm like, Ah."
00:56:26.508,00:56:29.845,"Chino's been running ho's up in there, but your dad will explain that to you."
00:56:29.845,00:56:35.226,"Look at it. Your dogs, they shitting all over my place. Liquid shit."
00:56:35.226,00:56:39.646,"It doesn't help, you going around shellacking it in with furniture polish."
00:56:39.646,00:56:41.857,"There's a piece right there. Please, get that."
00:56:41.857,00:56:44.360,Fine. I got it.
00:56:46.195,00:56:49.823,"Francine, can I please have the parole jacket on Noah Trafficante?"
00:56:49.823,00:56:51.783,Thank you.
00:56:51.783,00:56:53.827,"I'm getting tired of this witness, man."
00:56:53.827,00:56:56.747,I wanna get back to my life the way it was.
00:56:56.747,00:57:00.167,"I'm tired. Okay, I got married so I could stop lying."
00:57:00.167,00:57:02.502,You know what? I cannot believe you're complaining.
00:57:02.502,00:57:06.798,"You got it easy compared to me, living in that zoo you call home."
00:57:06.798,00:57:08.884,Why you got to call my place a zoo?
00:57:08.884,00:57:11.469,I'm tired of you talking that stuff.
00:57:11.469,00:57:14.639,"Don't call my place no zoo, man."
00:57:16.975,00:57:19.686,"Yo, that's my silk shirt, man!"
00:57:19.686,00:57:22.064,Yeah. It's kind of nice.
00:57:22.064,00:57:26.026,"I figure since I'm gonna be like Mike, I might as well dress like Mike. You know."
00:57:26.026,00:57:29.113,"I wanna be, I wanna be like Mike."
00:57:29.113,00:57:31.282,Pow! Huh?
00:57:31.282,00:57:33.742,You're sick.
00:57:33.742,00:57:36.995,You have a problem and you should have yourself checked.
00:57:36.995,00:57:39.123,Probably.
00:57:39.123,00:57:40.791,Here's the file.
00:57:40.791,00:57:42.542,Thank you. Thank you.
00:57:42.542,00:57:45.587,"Can you take care of this, please? I gotta call the wife."
00:57:46.838,00:57:50.092,Whose wife?
00:57:50.092,00:57:52.803,"One time today, just do something!"
00:57:52.803,00:57:54.763,Do something that helps this case.
00:57:54.763,00:57:56.140,Boy.
00:57:56.140,00:57:58.350,"You look real handsome today, Marcus."
00:57:58.350,00:58:02.813,"No, see, it's not that kind of day. Okay?"
00:58:02.813,00:58:04.648,Seriously.
00:58:04.648,00:58:06.191,"What's up, babe, PMS?"
00:58:06.191,00:58:07.567,"No, damn the jokes."
00:58:07.567,00:58:08.944,Damn them.
00:58:08.944,00:58:11.238,Ring it. Ain't in the mood.
00:58:11.238,00:58:13.907,"Yeah, that's cool. Hold on."
00:58:15.700,00:58:16.910,Okay. Go ahead.
00:58:18.662,00:58:21.706,Mm-hm. All right.
00:58:21.706,00:58:23.250,How are things going with the kids?
00:58:23.250,00:58:25.543,THERESA: They're fine.
00:58:25.543,00:58:30.174,How's that potty-training thing going?
00:58:30.174,00:58:31.883,You're so silly.
00:58:31.883,00:58:33.135,You gonna be late tonight?
00:58:33.135,00:58:36.347,"It'll be 10:30, 11:00 before I get in."
00:58:36.347,00:58:39.557,"No, don't wait up."
00:58:43.354,00:58:45.356,"So yeah, why don't you rent a movie or something?"
00:58:45.356,00:58:47.774,You know. Something we can kick back to.
00:58:50.527,00:58:54.031,"So, what you wearing?"
00:58:54.031,00:58:58.576,She hung up a long time ago.
00:58:58.576,00:59:01.330,Hello?
00:59:01.330,00:59:06.584,"Hey, man. Don't play that."
00:59:06.584,00:59:08.962,Stop wearing my clothes then.
00:59:11.507,00:59:15.593,"Everybody about the motherfucking jokes today, ain't they? Hello."
00:59:15.593,00:59:18.389,MIKE: I can't believe this.
00:59:18.389,00:59:21.433,"Come on, Francine, this Eddie Dominguez file can't be that hard to get into."
00:59:21.433,00:59:23.643,"I tried three times, I just can't get in."
00:59:23.643,00:59:26.271,"Besides, you know, this is illegal."
00:59:26.271,00:59:30.942,"Well, yeah, that never stopped you before. Just let me know if you get anything."
00:59:30.942,00:59:34.488,Anything for you.
00:59:47.334,00:59:49.336,"What's up, Chet?"
00:59:49.336,00:59:52.130,Chet.
00:59:53.340,00:59:56.676,Okay. The Lowrey Brothers.
00:59:56.676,01:00:00.805,MIKE: Let's just get down to Club Hell and pick up Noah.
01:00:00.805,01:00:03.517,"Julie, it's me!"
01:00:03.517,01:00:06.520,What's up? You're supposed to be getting us into this Eddie Dominguez file.
01:00:06.520,01:00:08.772,It's gonna be a day or two.
01:00:08.772,01:00:12.568,We don't have no day or two.
01:00:12.568,01:00:14.945,It's gonna take a while before we can hack the computer.
01:00:14.945,01:00:19.074,You not taking care of shit.
01:00:19.074,01:00:20.534,Hi.
01:00:21.910,01:00:24.288,You must be Marcus.
01:00:24.288,01:00:26.998,That's right.
01:00:26.998,01:00:28.833,I'm Julie.
01:00:28.833,01:00:32.087,Julie. All right.
01:00:32.087,01:00:34.881,You too.
01:00:32.087,01:00:36.674,I recognized you from every one of the photographs.
01:00:36.674,01:00:39.595,"Oh. Well, it's my man, you know."
01:00:42.013,01:00:44.391,"The wall. Yeah, those on the wall."
01:00:44.391,01:00:48.979,You must be very good.
01:00:48.979,01:00:53.525,As a partner.
01:00:53.525,01:00:56.236,What time are we doing this thing tonight?
01:00:56.236,01:00:58.989,Excuse me?
01:01:01.241,01:01:04.620,"Yeah, well, we, as in me and my partner."
01:01:04.620,01:01:08.039,You wanted home protective custody. You at my house.
01:01:08.039,01:01:10.292,"Oh, that's just great."
01:01:10.292,01:01:14.838,So I'll just stay here again with Chet the mini-moron doorman to protect me?
01:01:14.838,01:01:16.089,Chet is very good.
01:01:16.089,01:01:18.258,"Oh, I'm so..."
01:01:18.258,01:01:21.761,That looks like a stain on your rug. Damn.
01:01:21.761,01:01:25.974,"That was my baby, Luke."
01:01:25.974,01:01:28.477,"And he just shits, huh?"
01:01:28.477,01:01:32.063,"Well, it's sort of... It's like marking his territory It's sort of a male thing."
01:01:32.063,01:01:35.108,I offered to pay Mike for the cleaning and he wouldn't hear of it.
01:01:35.108,01:01:37.819,I'm gonna get rid of it.
01:01:37.819,01:01:41.198,"Yeah, I was going to throw that out anyway, you know I just want a new look."
01:01:41.198,01:01:44.284,"Mike, he's a special guy."
01:01:44.284,01:01:46.703,"That's what I call him, Special Mike."
01:01:46.703,01:01:48.664,It's funny...
01:01:46.703,01:01:50.666,I like how you can just laugh at that.
01:01:50.666,01:01:56.505,"I love him. Now, me, whoo! I'd be pissed."
01:01:56.505,01:01:59.466,"Oh, and look at this cute little dog on the couch."
01:01:59.466,01:02:01.385,That's Luke.
01:02:01.385,01:02:03.637,Look how he just crawls around on the leather.
01:02:03.637,01:02:08.099,You want to meet Duke?
01:02:03.637,01:02:10.894,He's in the bed. He's been feeling sort of upset and having diarrhea and throwing up all morning.
01:02:10.894,01:02:12.688,"Oh, baby."
01:02:12.688,01:02:16.107,"Let's go see if little Duke is going to be okay, shall we?"
01:02:22.030,01:02:24.074,Me and you. Me and you.
01:02:25.409,01:02:27.703,"Oh, Mike."
01:02:27.703,01:02:29.162,"MARCUS: Hey, lady, who are you?"
01:02:29.162,01:02:30.497,YVETTE: Who the hell are you?
01:02:30.497,01:02:32.040,"MARCUS: Look, you gotta get out."
01:02:32.040,01:02:34.292,Get your hands off me!
01:02:34.292,01:02:36.336,YVETTE: I'm Yvette.
01:02:36.336,01:02:37.588,YVETTE: Get your hands off me!
01:02:37.588,01:02:39.297,"Hey, what are you doing?"
01:02:39.297,01:02:41.049,"Get out of here, all right?"
01:02:41.049,01:02:44.010,"If you don't stop stalking me, I'm gonna arrest your ass."
01:02:44.010,01:02:45.929,You old psycho!
01:02:45.929,01:02:49.015,YVETTE: You asshole!
01:02:50.141,01:02:52.269,What's going on out here?
01:02:53.437,01:02:55.021,MARCUS: That was crazy Yvette.
01:02:55.021,01:02:56.648,Stalking me. Ha.
01:02:58.400,01:03:01.778,Yvette?
01:03:06.908,01:03:10.203,Yvette is a masseuse.
01:03:13.123,01:03:15.250,She massages shit.
01:03:15.250,01:03:17.335,She told me.
01:03:17.335,01:03:25.302,"Hey, listen, are there any other totally hysterical, half-naked women popping by tonight that I should know about?"
01:03:25.302,01:03:27.887,She was naked?
01:03:27.887,01:03:30.890,You threw Yvette out naked?
01:03:33.393,01:03:34.894,My wife would hate...
01:03:34.894,01:03:37.897,She hates womanizers.
01:03:37.897,01:03:41.276,I don't believe... You see...
01:03:41.276,01:03:43.528,"You don't respect other people's shit, that's your problem."
01:03:43.528,01:03:45.071,I've been telling you for years.
01:03:45.071,01:03:47.783,"Ever since we started, your trash is all over."
01:03:47.783,01:03:50.452,Enough! Please!
01:03:50.452,01:03:56.124,"Me and my partner, we're going to Club Hell so we can bust this fool Noah."
01:03:56.124,01:03:58.084,Does anybody have a problem with that?
01:03:58.084,01:03:59.461,Fine.
01:04:01.087,01:04:03.214,Don't blow the case.
01:04:12.599,01:04:15.101,"Okay, Frank, here's the deal, okay."
01:04:15.101,01:04:17.395,"Anybody tells you to move, don't."
01:04:17.395,01:04:19.523,Tell them you're making a delivery for Fouchet.
01:04:19.523,01:04:21.358,You got it? You got it? Frank?
01:04:22.651,01:04:25.362,It's ether!
01:04:27.071,01:04:29.783,"Don't even breathe, you knucklehead!"
01:04:42.253,01:04:44.214,Noah.
01:04:44.214,01:04:46.090,I remember you.
01:05:04.735,01:05:06.528,"Check it, Lowrey..."
01:05:06.528,01:05:09.322,We got two days left.
01:05:09.322,01:05:12.033,"No gunshots, no dead bodies."
01:05:12.033,01:05:14.327,I'm not trying to lose my job on this one.
01:05:14.327,01:05:18.289,"Well, you know, if I recall, the last couple dead bad guys belonged to you."
01:05:18.289,01:05:22.878,"And next time you have to kill them, why don't you do it after you get the information that we need."
01:05:22.878,01:05:24.755,Just a suggestion.
01:05:24.755,01:05:29.342,Please. You ain't even trying to compare body counts.
01:05:29.342,01:05:31.762,Should I keep going all day? I'm out.
01:05:31.762,01:05:33.430,I'm out.
01:05:33.430,01:05:36.349,This guy Noah's parole jacket says he works in there.
01:05:36.349,01:05:39.770,We're standing out front arguing like a couple of schoolgirls.
01:05:39.770,01:05:43.189,What do you say we put an end to all this bickering?
01:05:43.189,01:05:45.525,Because you starting to get on my goddamn nerves.
01:05:49.529,01:05:51.989,He got no package.
01:06:10.174,01:06:12.176,Look at you! Look at you!
01:06:12.176,01:06:15.430,Can you stay focused?
01:06:15.430,01:06:18.141,Yeah. Focused on all this scattered ass around here.
01:06:18.141,01:06:20.769,Let's do what we came to do and get the fuck out of here.
01:06:20.769,01:06:22.145,Simple.
01:06:22.145,01:06:23.605,"Let's just split up, check around."
01:06:23.605,01:06:25.148,Meet you at the bar in 10 minutes.
01:06:25.148,01:06:27.191,Fine.
01:06:31.613,01:06:34.574,"CASPER: Holy shit, what the hell is he doing?"
01:06:34.574,01:06:38.244,"Oh, man! That's the cop!"
01:06:38.244,01:06:40.622,NOAH: That's him! I'm going.
01:06:49.631,01:06:51.132,What's up?
01:06:51.132,01:06:53.009,MARCUS: Whoo...
01:06:53.009,01:06:56.429,Budweiser. Feel like I had a million of them.
01:07:09.066,01:07:10.694,"What's up, motherfucker?"
01:07:24.541,01:07:26.710,"Tell me where the girl is, jack-off!"
01:08:01.995,01:08:03.621,"Oh, fuck!"
01:08:13.590,01:08:17.134,"Next time, learn how to work the safety with your punk-ass."
01:08:17.134,01:08:18.845,I'll be back.
01:08:26.978,01:08:29.355,Who done tore off and whupped your ass now?
01:08:29.355,01:08:32.275,This ain't the time.
01:08:32.275,01:08:35.070,Look. They know. Let's get Noah and get out of here.
01:08:50.752,01:08:53.296,"Hey, it's the chick."
01:08:53.296,01:08:55.882,The girl.
01:09:20.615,01:09:22.075,Julie!
01:09:38.341,01:09:41.302,MARCUS: Let's go!
01:09:47.934,01:09:50.728,"MIKE: The truck! Come on, let's take the truck!"
01:09:50.728,01:09:52.105,There! Right there! Go!
01:09:52.105,01:09:54.190,MIKE: Move it! Move it!
01:09:54.190,01:09:55.942,We're really in a hurry.
01:09:57.610,01:09:59.570,Let's go!
01:09:59.570,01:10:02.615,JULIE: You're cops! Why are we running away? He's in there!
01:10:02.615,01:10:03.908,Here! Go!
01:10:14.002,01:10:15.294,This is good.
01:10:15.294,01:10:17.005,Noah's chasing us!
01:10:18.006,01:10:19.883,What was that?
01:10:19.883,01:10:21.384,What the...
01:10:21.384,01:10:24.179,That was...
01:10:24.179,01:10:27.974,But I had a perfectly good shot at him if your friend Action Jackson over here...
01:10:29.475,01:10:32.228,No! No! This is official police business!
01:10:32.228,01:10:36.315,You had no business in there!
01:10:36.315,01:10:39.360,Please drive!
01:10:39.360,01:10:41.905,You're the one who picked a slow-ass ice-cream truck!
01:10:43.447,01:10:45.783,What am I smelling?
01:10:45.783,01:10:48.536,What am I smelling?
01:10:48.536,01:10:50.997,Extremely flammable ether.
01:10:50.997,01:10:52.289,"Oh, shit."
01:10:52.289,01:10:53.708,Goddamn.
01:10:53.708,01:10:55.292,You the man!
01:10:55.292,01:10:57.170,You the fucking man tonight!
01:10:57.170,01:11:00.006,How you gonna pick an ice-cream truck that's a damn bomb?
01:11:04.886,01:11:06.303,Shit!
01:11:06.303,01:11:08.389,This is protective custody?
01:11:08.389,01:11:09.557,Yes!
01:11:16.647,01:11:18.524,"Oh, shit!"
01:11:33.289,01:11:35.875,"You better do something, boy!"
01:11:35.875,01:11:37.668,Who picked this dumb-ass road?
01:11:37.668,01:11:40.504,All the goddamn road in Miami and you run out of it!
01:11:40.504,01:11:42.506,"You gotta come up with an idea, fast!"
01:11:42.506,01:11:45.009,Why I gotta come up with all the ideas?
01:11:57.605,01:11:59.274,Take this shit!
01:11:59.274,01:12:01.859,We're coming to a dead end!
01:12:10.785,01:12:12.954,We out of fucking road!
01:12:15.623,01:12:19.961,Motherfucker's going to blow!
01:12:34.558,01:12:36.602,Well...
01:12:36.602,01:12:39.063,Should I add this to your body count?
01:12:41.357,01:12:44.235,There goes our only lead to the dope.
01:12:44.235,01:12:47.363,Ain't this a bitch.
01:12:47.363,01:12:50.200,The dope? The do...
01:12:50.200,01:12:52.576,What are you talking about?
01:12:52.576,01:12:57.040,"How about, There goes our only lead to Max's killer? He's still out there."
01:12:57.040,01:13:02.753,"Oh, but, I mean, that's not really important 'cause it's not like it's your job to protect people. Holy shit."
01:13:02.753,01:13:05.589,See what I'm saying?
01:13:09.302,01:13:11.221,You're gone!
01:13:11.221,01:13:14.015,What's wrong with you?
01:13:14.015,01:13:16.893,She done zoomed.
01:13:16.893,01:13:18.228,No way.
01:13:18.228,01:13:21.064,"Listen, yes, okay, you're right."
01:13:21.064,01:13:24.692,This whole thing started because of missing drugs.
01:13:21.064,01:13:32.449,"But let me tell you something, there's nothing, absolutely nothing, more important to Mike than doing this guy that killed Max."
01:13:32.449,01:13:37.080,"I know, sometimes he has a hard time expressing his real feelings."
01:13:39.332,01:13:42.543,"Come on. It's gonna be all right, okay?"
01:13:42.543,01:13:44.587,We need you.
01:13:44.587,01:13:46.630,Part of the team.
01:13:46.630,01:13:50.051,JULIE: I thought he was supposed to be the smooth one.
01:13:51.177,01:13:53.388,MIKE: This has not been a good day.
01:13:53.388,01:14:01.312,"Damn right. This is bullshit. We got two days to find these fools, and we got no leads because you cooked Noah's ass back on the freeway."
01:14:05.108,01:14:07.568,Shampoo?
01:14:08.903,01:14:10.988,"MARCUS: Well, let's just do that."
01:14:12.865,01:14:14.242,MIKE: What's up?
01:14:18.662,01:14:21.582,"MARCUS: Julie, it don't take that long to get shampoo."
01:14:21.582,01:14:23.793,"Come on, please, let's go."
01:14:23.793,01:14:25.669,Animal tested.
01:14:25.669,01:14:28.464,Do you know how many chemicals are in this stuff?
01:14:28.464,01:14:31.717,I don't care if you go bald.
01:14:31.717,01:14:35.263,Jojo.
01:14:35.263,01:14:39.142,It's entirely too much heroin and too much ether for nobody to know nothing.
01:14:39.142,01:14:41.269,What's he talking about?
01:14:41.269,01:14:44.188,"Well, you know the barrels of ether that blew up on the ice-cream truck?"
01:14:44.188,01:14:46.316,They were gonna use that to process the heroin.
01:14:46.316,01:14:49.319,"Yeah, they do that to cut it."
01:14:49.319,01:14:52.822,"MARCUS: Yeah, you can't just nuke it."
01:14:52.822,01:14:54.324,"Let's just pay for this, all right?"
01:14:58.077,01:15:00.788,"MIKE: Hey, how much is that?"
01:15:00.788,01:15:03.374,"Damn, you know what?"
01:15:03.374,01:15:05.709,"Freeze, motherbitches!"
01:15:06.794,01:15:08.504,Don't you move.
01:15:08.504,01:15:11.215,I'm not understanding.
01:15:11.215,01:15:15.386,Do you just attract violent people?
01:15:15.386,01:15:17.972,"Take it easy, all right?"
01:15:17.972,01:15:21.558,You're not police officers.
01:15:21.558,01:15:23.311,MARCUS: Wait.
01:15:23.311,01:15:25.980,"I'm gonna reach for my badge, okay?"
01:15:25.980,01:15:28.274,"You want badges, motherbitch?"
01:15:28.274,01:15:29.608,I give you badges!
01:15:29.608,01:15:32.487,Here! 99 cents each.
01:15:32.487,01:15:35.698,He got eight fucking badges. I told you this cop thing don't work.
01:15:35.698,01:15:39.118,I blow you! Then I blow you!
01:15:39.118,01:15:42.746,Blow me? What the fuck?
01:15:42.746,01:15:45.291,I kill before. I kill again.
01:15:45.291,01:15:47.168,Please! Hold on!
01:15:47.168,01:15:48.836,"No, you hold on!"
01:15:48.836,01:15:50.796,Do you see the fucking emotion I'm going through right now?
01:15:50.796,01:15:53.049,That means this is serious.
01:15:53.049,01:15:56.511,That means me and this motherfucker is not vibing now. That's what that means.
01:15:56.511,01:15:59.763,You got something on your chest?
01:15:59.763,01:16:03.059,Hello! The guy's got a cannon.
01:16:03.059,01:16:05.561,You want some?
01:16:05.561,01:16:08.564,I'm gone!
01:16:08.564,01:16:10.149,"You freeze, bitch!"
01:16:10.149,01:16:13.027,"Oh, shit. I'm fucked."
01:16:13.027,01:16:14.945,Now back up.
01:16:14.945,01:16:19.492,Put the gun down. And get me a pack of tropical fruit Bubblicious.
01:16:19.492,01:16:21.702,And some Skittles.
01:16:26.290,01:16:29.001,MARCUS: Hell of a night.
01:16:29.001,01:16:33.005,So make yourself at home.
01:16:34.257,01:16:36.259,"I'll sit down, you know, for..."
01:16:36.259,01:16:38.386,For a minute.
01:16:38.386,01:16:42.806,"I'm guarding shit, you know. I'm watching out for the bad boys."
01:16:42.806,01:16:47.728,"I can see things real well, you know, from my peripherals."
01:16:47.728,01:16:54.444,"You know, for such a stud, Mike Lowrey, you sure seem a little rigid about having a girl in your bed."
01:16:55.528,01:16:56.820,Who?
01:16:56.820,01:16:59.449,Me? Mike Lowrey?
01:17:00.908,01:17:02.368,I'm comfortable.
01:17:02.368,01:17:05.996,It's my bed. Why would I be uncomfortable?
01:17:05.996,01:17:09.584,"I don't know. You know, I think it's more than just wired."
01:17:09.584,01:17:12.545,"I mean, maybe it was guns and stuff."
01:17:12.545,01:17:14.713,"I mean, I've never really shot a gun before."
01:17:14.713,01:17:17.716,"All that, I don't know, steel..."
01:17:17.716,01:17:21.804,I'm feeling... Don't you feel a little funny?
01:17:23.306,01:17:24.974,"I'm not a comedian, but..."
01:17:24.974,01:17:28.018,"I don't mean that kind of funny, I mean, like..."
01:17:28.018,01:17:29.895,funny.
01:17:38.654,01:17:40.406,You don't want that.
01:17:40.406,01:17:45.286,"You don't want that, because when I come, I come with the thunder."
01:17:45.286,01:17:46.996,And that's...
01:17:46.996,01:17:50.166,You sound like you're saving yourself for marriage.
01:17:52.335,01:17:55.212,"No, that ain't me there."
01:17:55.212,01:17:56.922,That's Marcus.
01:17:56.922,01:17:59.842,You know what I'm saying?
01:17:59.842,01:18:01.927,I got some other...
01:18:01.927,01:18:04.721,I done seen it now.
01:18:04.721,01:18:06.056,No.
01:18:06.056,01:18:08.058,"Turn the page, girl."
01:18:09.310,01:18:11.145,Don't laugh.
01:18:11.145,01:18:14.190,MIKE: No. I cannot believe he wore his Afro that big.
01:18:14.190,01:18:17.860,I forgot all about that.
01:18:17.860,01:18:19.945,What's Marcus' wife like?
01:18:24.116,01:18:26.160,She's like a wife.
01:18:26.160,01:18:30.956,"Well, I mean, she must be pretty amazing to keep a guy like Marcus."
01:18:34.627,01:18:36.546,Keep a guy like what?
01:18:36.546,01:18:40.633,"Well, you know, watching him tonight, he's very..."
01:18:40.633,01:18:42.259,sort of take charge.
01:18:42.259,01:18:45.555,The way he was throwing guys this way and that.
01:18:45.555,01:18:50.809,"You know, there's something about him. I don't know what it is. He's so smooth."
01:18:50.809,01:18:52.436,Boy...
01:18:52.436,01:18:54.104,I bet...
01:18:54.104,01:18:58.150,his wife's enjoying the smoothness right this minute.
01:18:59.943,01:19:03.989,He got a quality women respond to.
01:19:03.989,01:19:08.411,I can't imagine the kind of woman that wouldn't find Marcus...
01:19:08.411,01:19:10.204,attractive.
01:19:10.204,01:19:13.165,Probably couldn't be around him and...
01:19:13.165,01:19:16.001,"just, you know, like our situation."
01:19:16.001,01:19:19.880,If two people were alone...
01:19:19.880,01:19:21.090,Excuse me.
01:19:25.469,01:19:27.137,What is wrong with him?
01:19:27.137,01:19:30.266,This one goes on the bulletin board at work.
01:19:30.266,01:19:32.560,"Don't do that. No, come on."
01:19:32.560,01:19:35.563,"Mike, put it back in, I can't believe you took it out."
01:19:35.563,01:19:38.691,Come on. Marcus will kill us if he finds out.
01:19:38.691,01:19:40.735,I can't believe I let you see it.
01:19:40.735,01:19:42.278,Motherfucker!
01:19:49.493,01:19:51.036,Goddamn it.
01:19:51.036,01:19:52.996,Got some jewelery for you.
01:19:52.996,01:19:55.416,"I'm sorry, but damn that."
01:19:55.416,01:20:00.463,Whoa. I think we need to address this serious lack of trust in this relationship.
01:20:00.463,01:20:04.007,Please.
01:20:04.007,01:20:05.217,I won't be long.
01:20:05.217,01:20:07.219,"Oh, it's legal."
01:20:07.219,01:20:08.721,Out of sight.
01:20:10.514,01:20:13.601,"Yeah, Sanchez, Lowrey."
01:20:13.601,01:20:15.894,I think these guys are about to make a move.
01:20:15.894,01:20:19.231,Blue convertible.
01:20:25.362,01:20:28.616,"Hey, hey, hey. Here we go."
01:20:28.616,01:20:30.326,Where's the girl?
01:20:30.326,01:20:32.077,I don't see any girl.
01:20:38.041,01:20:40.877,"Fuck off, barking-ass dog."
01:20:43.589,01:20:45.633,Sneak up on my own motherfucking house.
01:20:46.967,01:20:48.636,MAN 1: What in the world?
01:20:48.636,01:20:50.012,Very strange.
01:20:50.012,01:20:53.390,His ass is upstairs.
01:20:53.390,01:20:54.933,You motherfucker!
01:20:54.933,01:20:57.436,"Like ducking and weaving, up and down."
01:20:57.436,01:20:59.772,MARCUS: Look at this shit.
01:20:59.772,01:21:02.483,Got me climbing like a fucking chimp.
01:21:02.483,01:21:05.152,"No, I ain't going out like that."
01:21:05.152,01:21:07.988,Don't take nobody that goddamn long to get in bed.
01:21:09.281,01:21:12.409,Got my babies in the house.
01:21:12.409,01:21:18.708,"The man can't get no quality time, but, oh, yeah, my partner can get some quality time."
01:21:27.466,01:21:28.801,"Oh, my God."
01:21:28.801,01:21:32.137,MIKE: Get the kids.
01:21:32.137,01:21:35.725,MARCUS: I knew it! I didn't even have to call a fucking psychic line.
01:21:35.725,01:21:36.933,MIKE: Freeze!
01:21:41.731,01:21:44.483,"Move, and you're dead."
01:21:44.483,01:21:47.903,MAN 1: Gun right up to his head. Gonna shoot each other. This is unbelievable.
01:21:47.903,01:21:51.532,Miami Police! Freeze!
01:21:51.532,01:21:52.991,"Marcus, what are you doing?"
01:21:52.991,01:21:55.118,You're doing Theresa!
01:21:55.118,01:21:56.787,You're doing my baby!
01:21:58.997,01:22:02.000,MAN 2: We could sneak up and snuff them both right now.
01:22:02.000,01:22:04.044,"MAN 1: Yeah, but we're supposed to get the girl."
01:22:04.044,01:22:07.297,"Never fuck with a cop's family, asshole."
01:22:07.297,01:22:09.383,Doesn't that piss you off?
01:22:09.383,01:22:12.595,"Yeah, yeah."
01:22:12.595,01:22:14.555,Motherfucker!
01:22:14.555,01:22:16.849,"This whole shit is making you crazy, man!"
01:22:16.849,01:22:19.769,You know damn well ain't nothing going on between me and Theresa!
01:22:22.772,01:22:28.151,"Man, I've been your partner for six years and I've been your boy all my life."
01:22:28.151,01:22:29.904,For you to even think...
01:22:29.904,01:22:33.532,To even let some dumb shit like that creep up in your mind!
01:22:33.532,01:22:36.535,"This is me, man!"
01:22:36.535,01:22:38.788,"Man, fucking..."
01:22:40.372,01:22:41.791,THERESA: Mike!
01:22:46.295,01:22:48.631,I'm fine!
01:22:48.631,01:22:50.841,"Get the fuck out of here, man! Where's Julie?"
01:22:50.841,01:22:53.385,"She's in the car, handcuffed to the steering wheel."
01:22:53.385,01:22:55.554,Are you trying to blow this whole case?
01:22:55.554,01:22:57.556,My bad. I ain't had no quality time.
01:22:57.556,01:23:00.643,You know how that shit is.
01:23:06.356,01:23:08.859,"My bad, all right?"
01:23:08.859,01:23:11.153,"Go, go. All right."
01:23:14.531,01:23:18.327,These phone calls were made to Club Hell from this precinct.
01:23:18.327,01:23:20.454,Explain.
01:23:20.454,01:23:24.207,I'm gonna ask you one more time. Give me a name.
01:23:24.207,01:23:28.545,Okay. Okay.
01:23:28.545,01:23:31.006,All I know is his name.
01:23:31.006,01:23:34.343,"RUIZ: You're looking at a lot of time, you know that?"
01:23:34.343,01:23:36.178,Fouchet.
01:23:36.178,01:23:37.554,"Fouchet, I think."
01:23:37.554,01:23:39.431,"That's his whole name, Fouchet?"
01:23:39.431,01:23:42.643,Fouchet.
01:23:42.643,01:23:44.812,"Stop it, please."
01:23:44.812,01:23:47.648,I swear. Watching the house was my first gig.
01:23:47.648,01:23:51.234,SANCHEZ: How sweet.
01:23:51.234,01:23:52.862,You know something?
01:23:51.234,01:23:58.742,"If you were a real cop, in the field, working every day, you'd realize that shit happens."
01:23:58.742,01:24:01.578,"You know, you're on your way to being reassigned."
01:24:01.578,01:24:03.539,Who's gonna reassign me? You?
01:24:03.539,01:24:05.541,You don't have the authority to reassign me.
01:24:05.541,01:24:09.378,"So until you do, stay the hell out of here!"
01:24:09.378,01:24:12.589,They should just bone and get that shit over with.
01:24:12.589,01:24:15.091,I'm getting really tired of this.
01:24:15.091,01:24:17.011,You're tired?
01:24:19.262,01:24:22.892,"They're overfed, they're lazy."
01:24:22.892,01:24:26.144,These guard dogs are nothing.
01:24:26.144,01:24:28.022,Don't make this hard!
01:24:32.150,01:24:34.069,"Nice running into you, Jojo."
01:24:34.069,01:24:36.947,"Always making it hard on yourself, Jojo."
01:24:36.947,01:24:39.992,"Gee, Julie, what have you been up to the last couple of days?"
01:24:39.992,01:24:43.286,"Oh, nothing. Just hanging out, handcuffed to steering wheels."
01:24:43.286,01:24:46.707,MARCUS: Now we're looking for someone who could step on a shit-load of heroin.
01:24:46.707,01:24:49.668,"Do it real fast, real well."
01:24:49.668,01:24:52.963,"Well, I told you already, I'm in the rubber business now."
01:24:52.963,01:24:55.841,"Jojo, we're not playing, man."
01:24:55.841,01:24:58.677,Huh?
01:24:58.677,01:25:03.265,"I'm straight like a board, like an arrow. I'm so straight, it's sick."
01:25:03.265,01:25:07.102,"Jojo. It's a lot of dope, man."
01:25:07.102,01:25:10.230,Cut it?
01:25:10.230,01:25:12.357,I'm sick of this bullshit.
01:25:13.400,01:25:15.151,Bullshit!
01:25:16.820,01:25:19.155,"What's up, yo?"
01:25:19.155,01:25:22.826,You guys are cops!
01:25:22.826,01:25:24.828,Put your ass on TV.
01:25:24.828,01:25:27.873,I got this. Jojo...
01:25:27.873,01:25:30.208,I got 15 bullets in this gun.
01:25:30.208,01:25:34.880,"I swear, if you don't start talking to me, I'm gonna fill your lying ass full of some hot shit."
01:25:34.880,01:25:36.840,He's a former ganja-smoking motherfucker.
01:25:36.840,01:25:38.968,He ain't worth it.
01:25:38.968,01:25:41.386,I'll bust your ass too!
01:25:41.386,01:25:43.346,So sad.
01:25:43.346,01:25:45.474,"You're on your own, Jojo."
01:25:46.391,01:25:47.684,"What's up, Jo?"
01:25:47.684,01:25:51.855,"But I'm gonna tell you like this, you splatter his ass, he's no good to us."
01:25:51.855,01:25:53.398,Fuck that.
01:25:53.398,01:25:55.358,Fuck that. I'm not going down over this shit.
01:25:55.358,01:25:58.236,I'm not going down for you killing Jojo the tire man!
01:25:58.236,01:25:59.696,"Okay, okay."
01:25:59.696,01:26:01.991,Fuck that! I don't want no brain on me.
01:26:01.991,01:26:04.367,Shit gets in your clothes and it stinks.
01:26:04.367,01:26:06.495,Okay.
01:26:06.495,01:26:08.413,I'll tell you what I know.
01:26:08.413,01:26:10.540,I know a little bit about a little bit.
01:26:10.540,01:26:12.960,"Tell him something, Jo."
01:26:12.960,01:26:14.419,There's three guys.
01:26:14.419,01:26:16.588,They got a laboratory...
01:26:16.588,01:26:19.633,It's two guys. One guy died in a plane crash last year.
01:26:20.801,01:26:23.178,There needs to be more!
01:26:23.178,01:26:26.890,"No, it's one guy, really."
01:26:26.890,01:26:28.684,"Don't fuck with me, Jojo."
01:26:28.684,01:26:35.107,"This guy's an Einstein, motherfucking genius college boy, fucking egghead motherfucker."
01:26:35.107,01:26:37.359,He got a rich mom and daddy who live in Coconut Grove.
01:26:37.359,01:26:40.154,Where?
01:26:40.154,01:26:41.613,I'll tell you where it's at.
01:26:42.906,01:26:44.908,"MIKE: You'd do that for us, Jojo?"
01:26:44.908,01:26:49.913,Yeah. I want to help.
01:26:49.913,01:26:52.041,in the...
01:26:52.041,01:26:53.416,office.
01:26:54.918,01:26:58.547,Thanks. Why don't you go grab that.
01:26:58.547,01:26:59.965,You can go ahead.
01:26:59.965,01:27:02.384,"Yeah, now's good."
01:27:02.384,01:27:04.302,This is on me.
01:27:04.302,01:27:06.055,Why don't you pick out some whitewalls for yourselves.
01:27:06.055,01:27:08.098,A little gift from me to you.
01:27:10.308,01:27:13.645,You made me think you were going to shoot me for a minute.
01:27:13.645,01:27:15.022,I was.
01:27:17.774,01:27:20.402,"MARCUS: Man, when's this punk-ass chemist coming home?"
01:27:20.402,01:27:22.320,JULIE: So...
01:27:22.320,01:27:24.322,this is a stakeout.
01:27:24.322,01:27:26.158,Not what I imagined.
01:27:26.158,01:27:29.119,Thought there'd be more conversation.
01:27:29.119,01:27:35.042,"Sorry, it's not up to your usual high standards."
01:27:35.042,01:27:37.669,Is he always like this on a stakeout?
01:27:37.669,01:27:40.797,What is it?
01:27:40.797,01:27:42.424,Not enough sex?
01:27:42.424,01:27:45.510,"MIKE: Ooh, I can't believe she went there on you."
01:27:45.510,01:27:48.180,You don't know who you talking to?
01:27:48.180,01:27:51.183,That's Mike Lowrey over there.
01:27:51.183,01:27:53.185,King Ding-a-ling.
01:27:53.185,01:27:55.771,"Go ahead, why don't you whip it out for her, big boy?"
01:27:55.771,01:27:58.065,"Uh-huh, right on your forehead."
01:27:58.065,01:27:59.441,Yeah.
01:28:08.324,01:28:10.160,There he is!
01:28:10.160,01:28:12.121,Let's go! Move!
01:28:26.301,01:28:28.137,MARCUS: What are our chances?
01:28:28.137,01:28:30.139,"Well, remember Club Hell?"
01:28:30.139,01:28:31.306,Worse.
01:28:33.058,01:28:35.227,That's it.
01:28:35.227,01:28:37.271,I want motherfucking swimming ducks in here.
01:28:37.271,01:28:39.481,"Whoa, hold it."
01:28:39.481,01:28:41.191,You know Sinclair got every phone in the station tapped.
01:28:41.191,01:28:44.527,We gotta do that in person.
01:28:44.527,01:28:50.159,"MARCUS: Shit. By the time we deal with her bullshit, every junkie in America will be high off our bust."
01:28:52.286,01:28:54.204,Can we help you?
01:28:54.204,01:28:56.790,"Hey, I staked out all night in the back of that jalopy too."
01:28:56.790,01:28:58.834,I think I earned a peek.
01:28:58.834,01:29:03.379,"Hey, this is real cop stuff, okay? This is not Charlie's Angels."
01:29:03.379,01:29:05.924,"All right, all right."
01:29:05.924,01:29:10.137,It can't hurt to look?
01:29:18.520,01:29:20.647,We have guests.
01:29:20.647,01:29:24.276,Have them followed.
01:29:29.906,01:29:37.455,"This high-speed chase, ending on a trestle near the River Drive and 34th Street, was captured two nights ago by our news team."
01:29:38.540,01:29:40.209,Mom!
01:29:43.045,01:29:45.255,I thought you said Daddy was in Cleveland.
01:29:45.255,01:29:47.174,Can't be in Cleveland.
01:29:47.174,01:29:49.551,The officers didn't like our cameras.
01:29:49.551,01:29:52.221,"No, baby. Your daddy just wishes he was in Cleveland."
01:29:52.221,01:29:57.391,"MARCUS: I'm telling you, this Fouchet, he's slick."
01:29:57.391,01:30:00.562,"FBI, DEA, they got nothing on him."
01:30:00.562,01:30:03.481,But he got to deal with us today.
01:30:13.992,01:30:16.119,What's that?
01:30:16.119,01:30:19.998,That's the last time they ever handcuff me.
01:30:19.998,01:30:21.624,Good boy.
01:30:23.668,01:30:25.795,"Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am!"
01:30:25.795,01:30:28.006,All visitors must be announced!
01:30:28.006,01:30:30.175,Pisses me off!
01:30:30.175,01:30:32.844,Lady! Lady!
01:30:32.844,01:30:36.430,"I guess when you guys get back, this'll all be over, right?"
01:30:36.430,01:30:38.100,MARCUS: You got that right.
01:30:38.100,01:30:41.519,"Now don't worry, though."
01:30:41.519,01:30:42.771,Cut loose.
01:30:42.771,01:30:45.690,You'll be back to your own life.
01:30:46.858,01:30:49.027,No more handcuffs.
01:30:53.115,01:30:56.618,I'm out of here.
01:30:56.618,01:30:58.954,Move your ass.
01:31:02.540,01:31:04.376,"Hi, can I help you?"
01:31:04.376,01:31:07.712,"Yes, I'm here to kill my husband, Marcus Burnett."
01:31:07.712,01:31:10.673,And that'd be the tall one or the short one?
01:31:10.673,01:31:12.175,The short one.
01:31:12.175,01:31:14.761,Thought so.
01:31:14.761,01:31:16.346,MARCUS: Is Chet ringing the...
01:31:16.346,01:31:18.098,"Oh, babe!"
01:31:19.724,01:31:24.020,"Um, Theresa. Uh..."
01:31:24.020,01:31:28.900,Let me get your husband.
01:31:28.900,01:31:34.239,Okay. I know what it looks like. Did you get my message?
01:31:34.239,01:31:36.950,Huh?
01:31:36.950,01:31:38.952,Can you...
01:31:38.952,01:31:42.831,leave me and Mrs. Burnett alone?
01:31:42.831,01:31:44.333,JULIE: Right.
01:31:46.251,01:31:48.170,Y'all met?
01:31:48.170,01:31:50.005,Baby...
01:31:50.005,01:31:53.091,I know... So let me...
01:31:53.091,01:31:58.763,"As far as I'm concerned, you can keep the wedding ring in your pocket, because you and your little girlfriend..."
01:31:58.763,01:32:00.556,"Oh, shit."
01:32:00.556,01:32:04.311,...and Mike will all be very happy living here.
01:32:04.311,01:32:05.854,"Sweetie! Sweetie, honey!"
01:32:08.023,01:32:09.274,It's not even...
01:32:09.274,01:32:12.361,Uh-uh.
01:32:12.361,01:32:14.821,That shit be having a slant.
01:32:17.199,01:32:19.326,"No, you're no longer welcome to my house."
01:32:19.326,01:32:22.329,He didn't tell you I was coming in the airport early?
01:32:22.329,01:32:26.375,"Remember, I said call her, that you was gonna bring me to your place? Hold on."
01:32:26.375,01:32:27.959,"Tell her about what I told you, man."
01:32:27.959,01:32:31.921,You were gonna bring me here...
01:32:31.921,01:32:35.300,All right.
01:32:35.300,01:32:36.968,We're not arguing about this.
01:32:36.968,01:32:38.887,Okay. I'm raising my...
01:32:38.887,01:32:40.222,All right... Baby!
01:32:40.222,01:32:42.015,"Believe me, we wanted to tell you."
01:32:42.015,01:32:44.142,You know what?
01:32:42.015,01:32:47.187,"It really doesn't matter anymore, Marcus... Mike, Kojak, whatever your name is, okay?"
01:32:47.187,01:32:53.985,"Aside from the fact, I'll tell you something else, if his wife can find us, I'm a lot better off on my own."
01:32:53.985,01:32:55.653,This...
01:32:55.653,01:32:58.240,I can see how it would look a trip.
01:32:58.240,01:33:01.076,"You see me, I run out, I got a shirt open."
01:33:01.076,01:33:03.537,"You see Mike, he half-butt-naked."
01:33:03.537,01:33:05.414,Then you see the white girl.
01:33:05.414,01:33:10.293,"So the shit looks like we having one big motherfucking orgy, and ain't nobody humped."
01:33:10.293,01:33:12.504,I'm telling you.
01:33:12.504,01:33:15.798,"It's not what it looks like, okay?"
01:33:15.798,01:33:18.468,"Baby, she's a material witness."
01:33:18.468,01:33:21.012,That...
01:33:21.012,01:33:22.764,"Baby, Theresa, listen."
01:33:22.764,01:33:27.018,It was orders.
01:33:27.018,01:33:31.106,"Julie, can I talk to you?"
01:33:31.106,01:33:32.857,"Enough with the smooth shit, Mike."
01:33:32.857,01:33:34.608,It's not going to work anymore.
01:33:43.868,01:33:45.954,I don't care what you say!
01:33:51.543,01:33:52.877,Duck!
01:33:52.877,01:33:54.337,"Julie, get down!"
01:33:54.337,01:33:55.713,Get down!
01:34:26.953,01:34:28.538,Get out!
01:34:35.669,01:34:37.713,911!
01:34:39.799,01:34:42.676,Yeah. 911? Yeah. Chet here.
01:34:42.676,01:34:45.054,Go upstairs and take this! Take it!
01:34:47.140,01:34:50.268,Don't worry.
01:34:50.268,01:34:52.020,"I love you, Marcus."
01:34:53.313,01:34:55.190,"Shit, I forgot to give them the address!"
01:35:31.017,01:35:32.768,"CASPER: Go, go, go!"
01:35:32.768,01:35:34.312,Watch it! Watch it!
01:35:34.312,01:35:35.897,Keep going!
01:35:37.982,01:35:39.234,Get her in!
01:36:08.054,01:36:09.305,Move!
01:36:22.569,01:36:24.362,It's okay.
01:36:24.362,01:36:27.031,I'm with the police.
01:36:53.807,01:36:55.017,Drive!
01:37:31.429,01:37:33.973,Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.
01:37:46.611,01:37:48.321,HOWARD: What is it with you guys?
01:37:48.321,01:37:49.905,How come it always has to be good news/bad news?
01:37:51.115,01:37:55.077,"You know exactly where the dope is, but you lose our only witness."
01:37:55.077,01:37:56.996,"RUIZ: Lowrey, pick up your phone!"
01:37:58.498,01:37:59.957,Lowrey.
01:37:59.957,01:38:04.838,"I'm keeping your sweet little friend for four hours, until I make my deal."
01:38:04.838,01:38:07.382,And I will make my deal.
01:38:07.382,01:38:11.969,I just put a bullet in the chemist who fucked with my timetable.
01:38:13.137,01:38:15.640,The other one is for the girl.
01:38:15.640,01:38:17.433,Son of a bitch!
01:38:20.228,01:38:23.064,That twisted motherfucker just shot one of his employees.
01:38:23.064,01:38:25.650,"Says if we don't back up, he's gonna kill Julie."
01:38:25.650,01:38:27.068,HOWARD: Not now.
01:38:27.068,01:38:28.528,I told you to play by the rules.
01:38:28.528,01:38:29.945,Don't do this to me now.
01:38:29.945,01:38:31.322,I'm on the verge of solving this case!
01:38:31.322,01:38:33.324,You turned South Beach into a war zone.
01:38:33.324,01:38:35.076,I've finally got the authority to shut you down.
01:38:35.076,01:38:36.745,"As of today, you're all reassigned."
01:38:42.834,01:38:45.211,"All right, this guy is painting me into a corner."
01:38:45.211,01:38:47.881,Look. He's gonna kill the girl anyway.
01:38:47.881,01:38:51.467,"And we're not walking away from this bust, I don't give a shit what she says."
01:38:51.467,01:38:54.387,So the deal goes down in four hours.
01:38:54.387,01:38:56.890,That means you guys got two hours to find them.
01:38:58.307,01:39:00.560,It's time to get lucky.
01:39:00.560,01:39:02.019,Go do what you got to do.
01:39:04.230,01:39:08.942,"MIKE: Look, Fletcher, you kind of told us this thing would move a little quicker."
01:39:08.942,01:39:12.447,"Hey, man, it's not that easy, okay? If it was that easy, you guys would be doing it."
01:39:12.447,01:39:15.909,"Hey, man. Work your magic."
01:39:15.909,01:39:17.951,"Hey, man."
01:39:17.951,01:39:20.455,I'm doing an illegal favor for you.
01:39:20.455,01:39:24.626,"Okay, this is what I got put in jail for in the first place. So you back up off me."
01:39:24.626,01:39:31.215,"Man, you don't sit your lanky ass down, bottom line, I will knock you the fuck out!"
01:39:31.215,01:39:33.967,Can you have a seat?
01:39:33.967,01:39:35.762,"And I wasn't lying, Fletcher."
01:39:38.681,01:39:40.642,Cops are so dumb.
01:39:42.560,01:39:44.938,"Remember, you promised to get me out."
01:39:46.648,01:39:48.107,Eddie Dominguez.
01:39:49.776,01:39:51.820,There it is. Voila.
01:39:54.697,01:39:56.031,MIKE: Girlfriend?
01:40:03.706,01:40:12.924,"FRANCINE: I was New Year's Eve and my ex-boyfriend Eddie, and this French guy, they took some really horrible pictures of me."
01:40:12.924,01:40:21.599,"And they said that they'd put them up on the bulletin board at my kid's school, unless I gave them a lot of narcotics information."
01:40:21.599,01:40:26.187,But I never...
01:40:26.187,01:40:29.315,"Look, they got the girl."
01:40:29.315,01:40:32.986,"Because if we don't, they're gonna kill her. How do you make contact?"
01:40:32.986,01:40:35.237,I have their mobile-phone number.
01:40:37.699,01:40:39.868,"I know, I'm sorry. Listen."
01:40:39.868,01:40:42.996,"Mike, I'll make it up to you."
01:40:42.996,01:40:45.414,We don't have a lot of time. Let's go.
01:40:49.126,01:40:51.420,"You have such sexy ears, you know that?"
01:40:51.420,01:40:53.046,I want to lick them.
01:40:56.467,01:40:58.386,Yeah.
01:40:58.386,01:41:02.015,"No, there ain't no Romeo here, asshole. Who you laughing at?"
01:41:02.015,01:41:07.060,"Now this cell phone will keep triangulating him, no matter where he goes."
01:41:07.060,01:41:09.438,We'll watch this on this map until he stops.
01:41:11.607,01:41:13.066,Sector 2-3-4.
01:41:13.066,01:41:14.402,TECHNICIAN: The signal's still strong.
01:41:14.402,01:41:16.404,We still have a lock.
01:41:18.990,01:41:21.074,Thank you.
01:41:21.074,01:41:23.786,"Lucy was the queen, baby."
01:41:23.786,01:41:25.997,Lucille Ball was a bimbo.
01:41:25.997,01:41:29.042,Desi was the whole brains behind it.
01:41:29.042,01:41:30.626,What do you mean how can I say that?
01:41:30.626,01:41:32.921,"Take the bongos away, he's nothing."
01:41:32.921,01:41:35.256,"It's conga, don't be so stupid."
01:41:35.256,01:41:37.425,"MIKE: Yo, fellas, what's up?"
01:41:37.425,01:41:39.510,RUIZ: The fucking pencil squad.
01:41:39.510,01:41:41.554,"Hey, what, you get us assigned to traffic duty?"
01:41:41.554,01:41:45.516,"No, this is real."
01:41:45.516,01:41:47.142,This shit could get you killed.
01:41:50.897,01:41:52.314,Let's go.
01:42:02.700,01:42:03.952,MAN: Here we go!
01:42:05.244,01:42:07.080,It's Conrad.
01:42:07.080,01:42:08.790,I'm calling in a favor.
01:42:10.625,01:42:13.168,TECHNICIAN: Eastbound towards 135th Street.
01:42:15.004,01:42:17.090,"Northeast, keep going northeast."
01:42:17.090,01:42:20.175,"If I'm wrong about this, you can fire my ass."
01:42:20.175,01:42:24.388,"This is what I need, I need a SWAT team, helicopters."
01:42:24.388,01:42:28.350,"We're calling all cars here, baby. Only I don't know where we need them."
01:42:29.978,01:42:33.188,Very nice car you got there.
01:42:33.188,01:42:34.857,That's my toy.
01:42:34.857,01:42:37.234,I'm taking it with me for my collection.
01:42:37.234,01:42:40.237,And how about the wire transfers?
01:42:41.781,01:42:47.912,"Two wire transfers to your banks, totaling 180 million dollars."
01:42:49.246,01:42:50.790,And 20 in cash.
01:42:56.129,01:42:57.755,CASPER: Damn.
01:43:02.175,01:43:05.596,This has been a shitty week.
01:43:05.596,01:43:08.474,MAN: Getting full integration on that signal.
01:43:13.104,01:43:15.439,"Yeah, we're on the airfield now."
01:43:15.439,01:43:17.817,"You know what, I bet it's up in the old hangar section."
01:43:23.656,01:43:25.783,MAN: Let's bring it up!
01:43:26.868,01:43:29.120,Deposit confirmation requested.
01:43:29.120,01:43:31.372,"90 million, Geldersbank of Zurich."
01:43:36.209,01:43:37.545,No easy approach.
01:43:37.545,01:43:39.380,MARCUS: No time.
01:43:39.380,01:43:41.214,We gotta go now.
01:43:42.175,01:43:43.342,Not a problem.
01:43:46.679,01:43:49.348,"What, do you got an itch?"
01:43:49.348,01:43:51.224,Scratch this.
01:43:51.224,01:43:54.603,"I'll scratch whatever you want me to, you blue-eyed bitch."
01:44:06.407,01:44:07.867,Thank you.
01:44:09.660,01:44:12.163,You guys sure you want to do this?
01:44:12.163,01:44:14.331,Tuck in your skirt.
01:44:14.331,01:44:16.458,My shit always works sometimes!
01:44:20.713,01:44:24.466,This is the best you can buy. It's been very nice doing business with you.
01:44:35.686,01:44:37.939,"Oh, shit."
01:44:37.939,01:44:40.399,"MAN: Fouchet, it's a setup!"
01:44:46.321,01:44:48.574,"If I get killed, I'm fucking you up!"
01:44:51.368,01:44:52.912,"Goddamn it, go, go, go!"
01:44:56.249,01:44:57.583,"Go, goddamn it!"
01:45:09.804,01:45:11.931,"Okay, okay."
01:45:15.977,01:45:17.103,My God!
01:46:03.356,01:46:04.859,Julie!
01:46:12.365,01:46:14.327,"Oh, motherf..."
01:46:35.639,01:46:37.225,Get down!
01:46:39.310,01:46:40.728,Shit!
01:46:45.107,01:46:46.817,You forgot your boarding pass!
01:47:10.841,01:47:12.927,HENCHMAN: You motherfuckers!
01:47:13.969,01:47:15.221,What's up?
01:47:16.722,01:47:17.890,"Oh, shit!"
01:48:11.986,01:48:14.029,"Mike, let's go!"
01:48:14.029,01:48:15.448,"Mike, get in the car!"
01:48:18.617,01:48:21.494,Get in! Come on!
01:48:21.494,01:48:24.373,Let's go! Get in!
01:48:24.373,01:48:26.792,Get in!
01:48:27.960,01:48:29.420,JULIE: Get up!
01:48:50.191,01:48:53.486,"Oh, shit! Please, catch that motherfucker, he shot me."
01:48:53.486,01:48:56.197,"He shot you, he shot me!"
01:48:56.197,01:48:59.658,"I'm fine. I just had a little run-in with your friend Jim Brown over here, but I'm fine."
01:49:01.369,01:49:07.208,"He steals our shit, kidnaps Julie, shoots at my wife."
01:49:11.504,01:49:14.382,"Marcus, I just got one question for you, bro."
01:49:14.382,01:49:17.885,How the hell you gonna leave my ass at a gunfight to go get the car?
01:49:17.885,01:49:20.262,"You have got to shut up and let him drive, okay?"
01:49:27.853,01:49:30.856,Seem like that gunshot wound has improved your driving skills.
01:49:34.776,01:49:36.653,You got the right to remain silent.
01:49:39.073,01:49:42.201,Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
01:49:42.201,01:49:43.994,"Yo, man, what the fuck are you doing?"
01:49:43.994,01:49:45.538,Getting it out the way.
01:49:55.588,01:49:57.299,"Just punch it, man!"
01:50:03.347,01:50:06.183,This car's faster.
01:50:06.183,01:50:09.811,"It's gonna be one or the other, baby! It's gonna be him or it's gonna be us!"
01:50:13.566,01:50:15.859,"You better fucking win, that's all I know!"
01:50:15.859,01:50:18.112,You better win!
01:50:38.299,01:50:40.551,Now that's how you supposed to drive!
01:50:40.551,01:50:42.970,"From now on, that's how you drive!"
01:51:09.955,01:51:11.290,Freeze!
01:51:16.295,01:51:18.088,"He ain't even worth killing, man."
01:51:23.051,01:51:24.677,MIKE: Freeze!
01:51:50.162,01:51:58.587,"Fouchet. I bet when your punk-ass woke up this morning, you didn't think about 5:00 you'd have a hole in your leg, did you?"
01:52:02.090,01:52:05.511,"You couldn't kill me, you chickenshit, could you?"
01:52:05.511,01:52:07.720,"Oh, no. I could."
01:52:07.720,01:52:10.182,I was just pausing.
01:52:10.182,01:52:13.435,"See, I'm starting to get the hang of this whole marksman shit, you know what I mean?"
01:52:13.435,01:52:17.147,"That shooting them from 30 yards while they running away, no, that's not it."
01:52:17.147,01:52:19.191,"Here's where it is, right here."
01:52:19.191,01:52:21.235,"Point blank, up close and personal."
01:52:21.235,01:52:22.570,Mike.
01:52:22.570,01:52:25.322,That's what I'm talking about.
01:52:25.322,01:52:28.741,Would you do it?
