00:01:14.408,00:01:16.326,You and me are the same.
00:01:16.326,00:01:19.663,"When you're bigger, you'll be alpha lion, just like your daddy."

00:01:46.815,00:01:51.403,"Look on the bright side, Zuba."
00:01:46.815,00:01:54.823,"After I defeat you and take over as alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son."
00:01:56.784,00:02:02.623,"Before I kick your butt, let me ask you: Why do you want to become the alpha lion?"
00:02:02.623,00:02:05.960,"I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart..."
00:02:05.960,00:02:08.629,...and I want everyone else to do what I say.
00:02:09.755,00:02:12.841,We'll fight on three. One...
00:02:12.841,00:02:16.845,"Pay attention, Alakay. Daddy gonna show you how it's done."

00:02:43.831,00:02:45.540,Don't you forget it.
00:02:45.540,00:02:48.794,"And that, Alakay, is how you attack..."
00:02:49.920,00:02:51.212,Alakay?
00:02:54.800,00:02:55.968,Hah!

00:05:59.193,00:06:01.360,Gotta give it to him.
00:06:01.360,00:06:05.615,"Maybe he should take a break. You know, we could all use a vacation."
00:06:05.615,00:06:07.659,"Come on, where would we go on vacation?"
00:06:07.659,00:06:11.079,"I don't know about you, but I want to go to Connecticut!"

00:11:21.973,00:11:23.724,"It was incredible, wasn't it?"
00:11:23.724,00:11:25.644,I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
00:11:25.644,00:11:27.646,- Like when you bit me on the butt?
00:11:27.646,00:11:32.108,I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
00:11:32.108,00:11:36.196,It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
00:11:36.196,00:11:38.990,Are the butts next to the croutons at the salad bar?
00:11:40.450,00:11:42.202,You don't need to be sarcastic.
00:11:42.202,00:11:46.289,"When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program."

00:11:54.713,00:11:58.218,Like dating?
00:11:58.218,00:11:59.760,"Yeah, dating."

00:12:09.312,00:12:11.272,Darn it!
00:12:11.272,00:12:14.942,I'm gonna... What is holding up that beverage service?!
00:12:14.942,00:12:16.777,I'm gonna go check.
00:12:16.777,00:12:20.574,I'm gonna catch a few winks.
00:12:23.910,00:12:27.539,"Oh, I like laughing!"
00:12:27.539,00:12:30.625,- To laugh!

00:12:35.505,00:12:40.594,It's nothing personal. It's just that we're better than you.
00:12:40.594,00:12:42.845,"- He shoots, he scores!"
00:12:42.845,00:12:45.848,"- Hey, in-flight slave."
00:12:45.848,00:12:48.602,Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
00:12:48.602,00:12:50.645,We just wanted to check on the drinks we ordered.
00:12:50.645,00:12:52.939,Sorry. Been a little backed up.
00:12:52.939,00:12:55.567,- I guess I'll go back...
00:12:55.567,00:12:59.987,"You're freaking me out! Can you please go over there, please?"
00:12:59.987,00:13:03.283,What happened to the separation of the classes?
00:13:03.283,00:13:06.119,I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
00:13:07.912,00:13:10.873,"We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo."
00:13:10.873,00:13:12.292,"Skipper, look."
00:13:12.292,00:13:13.792,Analysis.
00:13:13.792,00:13:18.381,"Looks like a small bulb designed to indicate something out of the ordinary, like a malfunction."
00:13:18.381,00:13:20.717,I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
00:13:20.717,00:13:24.387,"- That too, sir."
00:13:24.971,00:13:26.681,Mm-hm.
00:13:26.681,00:13:28.182,Problemo solved.
00:13:28.182,00:13:30.602,- We may be out of fuel.
00:13:30.602,00:13:32.771,We've lost engine one...
00:13:34.063,00:13:36.149,...and engine two is no longer on fire.
00:13:36.149,00:13:37.233,"Buckle up, boys."

00:13:43.030,00:13:46.951,I've got good and bad news.
00:13:46.951,00:13:50.580,"The bad news is, we're crash-landing."
00:13:52.582,00:13:55.834,"When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice."
00:13:55.834,00:13:58.129,But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
00:14:09.557,00:14:14.020,"Raise your arms, Maurice!"
00:14:16.981,00:14:18.650,I can fly!
00:14:18.650,00:14:20.276,"This could be it, Marty!"
00:14:20.276,00:14:23.655,I want you to know you are truly a one-in-a-million friend!
00:14:23.655,00:14:26.616,"Thanks, buddy!"
00:14:26.616,00:14:30.453,- I know you won't mind when I tell you...
00:14:30.453,00:14:32.706,- I broke your iPod!
00:14:32.706,00:14:34.915,The buttons were so small!
00:14:34.915,00:14:37.084,- The horror!
00:14:37.084,00:14:39.504,"- I'll kill you, butt-biter!"
00:14:39.504,00:14:41.297,- An accident!

00:15:07.574,00:15:10.702,"My goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf."
00:15:10.702,00:15:12.328,"Rico, you've had your fun."
00:15:12.328,00:15:13.580,Pull up.
00:15:15.998,00:15:17.083,Gear down.
00:15:18.668,00:15:21.295,Gently. You just want to kiss the ground.
00:15:21.295,00:15:24.173,"Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister."
00:15:26.259,00:15:27.343,"I said, kiss it!"
00:15:32.473,00:15:35.727,Now just a little brake.
00:15:35.727,00:15:37.854,I believe that's checkmate.
00:15:45.236,00:15:49.031,Commence emergency landing procedure. Flaps up! Deploy!
00:16:05.005,00:16:06.925,"Oh, we're here."

00:16:11.387,00:16:14.599,What happened to the plane?
00:16:14.599,00:16:17.017,I'm OK. I'm alive.
00:16:17.017,00:16:21.147,I can't even sleep for a minute.

00:16:23.065,00:16:25.234,"Only two passengers unaccounted for, Skipper."
00:16:25.234,00:16:28.279,That's a number I can live with.
00:16:28.279,00:16:30.531,Who says a penguin can't fly?
00:16:30.531,00:16:35.745,"Hey, happy slappers!"
00:16:35.745,00:16:38.623,- We'll fix it.
00:16:38.623,00:16:41.501,"Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape."
00:16:41.501,00:16:45.463,"We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months."
00:16:45.463,00:16:48.466,- Sixty-nine months?!
00:16:48.466,00:16:51.302,"Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage."
00:16:51.302,00:16:55.598,- Where'd you get that number?
00:16:55.598,00:16:57.350,How do you estimate that?
00:16:57.350,00:17:00.937,Pretty boy! Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
00:17:00.937,00:17:04.273,Hold on. Who made you king of the plane wreck?
00:17:04.273,00:17:08.611,Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge. You fix the plane.
00:17:08.611,00:17:11.113,Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
00:17:11.113,00:17:13.658,"OK, then I'll remain in charge."
00:17:13.658,00:17:15.242,"Yeah, you will remain in charge."
00:17:15.242,00:17:17.954,You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
00:17:17.954,00:17:20.748,Correcto-mundo.
00:17:20.748,00:17:25.169,- Good for you.
00:17:25.169,00:17:27.254,Higher mammals!
00:17:27.254,00:17:30.299,We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
00:17:30.299,00:17:34.470,Phil! I should wash your hands out with soap.
00:17:34.470,00:17:38.098,"How in the, hell-o, will they fix this plane?!"
00:17:38.098,00:17:41.185,"You know, grit and spit and spit."
00:17:41.185,00:17:44.063,A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
00:17:44.063,00:17:46.524,That don't sound too promising.
00:17:46.524,00:17:48.943,You're right. We're stuck here.
00:17:48.943,00:17:53.031,"As long as we're together, we'll be OK."
00:17:53.031,00:17:56.576,"Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home."
00:17:56.576,00:17:58.661,Behold! The lion!
00:17:58.661,00:18:01.664,"- Hey, it's people!"
00:18:01.664,00:18:04.124,"Wait, wait, wait! People!"
00:18:05.919,00:18:07.879,- They'll help us!
00:18:07.879,00:18:10.882,- People! Stop!
00:18:12.091,00:18:14.635,"If you stop, I'll autograph those!"
00:18:14.635,00:18:17.096,I know you!
00:18:17.096,00:18:18.180,You.
00:18:18.180,00:18:20.516,It's the bad kitty.
00:18:28.775,00:18:30.359,How do you like some of that?!
00:18:49.587,00:18:52.465,"- Come in, Tokyo!"
00:18:53.841,00:18:55.593,Ow!
00:18:58.096,00:18:59.639,Right in the batteries.
00:18:59.639,00:19:02.850,You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
00:19:02.850,00:19:05.979,"Next time, I won't go so easy on you!"
00:19:06.896,00:19:08.856,"Thank you, dear."
00:19:12.234,00:19:16.948,Are you out of your mind?
00:19:16.948,00:19:18.532,Out of my mind?
00:19:18.532,00:19:21.828,- Aha! Who's out of my mind now?
00:19:21.828,00:19:24.122,- See if you can get an operator.
00:19:24.122,00:19:27.708,Out of my mind.
00:19:40.429,00:19:44.142,The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
00:19:44.142,00:19:46.936,Please try again later.
00:19:48.896,00:19:51.440,"Oh, my... Whoa!"
00:19:51.440,00:19:52.817,Am I trippin'?
00:19:52.817,00:19:56.320,like me.
00:19:57.488,00:20:00.033,- Where are we?
00:20:00.033,00:20:02.702,This time I'm 40 percent sure.
00:20:02.702,00:20:05.788,- I know this place.
00:20:05.788,00:20:08.499,- Africa?
00:20:08.499,00:20:11.044,Our ancestral crib.
00:20:11.044,00:20:13.546,It's in our blood.
00:20:13.546,00:20:16.298,"No, it's more than that."
00:20:16.298,00:20:19.552,"...déjà vu, like I've been here before."
00:20:19.552,00:20:21.345,It's like Roots!
00:20:21.345,00:20:22.930,"No, it's like..."
00:20:22.930,00:20:26.350,"...déjà vu, like I've been here before."
00:20:31.522,00:20:32.982,How!
00:20:36.736,00:20:38.696,Me Alex!
00:20:38.696,00:20:45.161,"Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird."
00:20:49.916,00:20:51.167,Smash ground!
00:20:52.001,00:20:54.045,Go boom!
00:20:54.045,00:20:57.882,Then here we emerge.
00:20:57.882,00:21:02.720,We offer only happiness and good greetings.
00:21:03.888,00:21:06.224,Is he dancing about a plane crash?
00:21:07.058,00:21:08.976,Yeah. We just... yeah.
00:21:08.976,00:21:10.728,I thought... Sorry.
00:21:10.728,00:21:13.272,You came from off the reserve?
00:21:13.272,00:21:16.275,"Way off. From the Central Park Zoo, actually."
00:21:23.950,00:21:25.492,Don't strain yourself.
00:21:25.492,00:21:27.828,What's going on here?
00:21:27.828,00:21:30.623,They say they're from off the reserve.
00:21:30.623,00:21:34.210,That's impossible. Only people come from off the reserve.
00:21:34.210,00:21:36.587,You look familiar.
00:21:36.587,00:21:39.048,How could you survive the hunters?
00:21:39.048,00:21:41.508,We didn't see any hunters.
00:21:41.508,00:21:43.427,- What are you looking at?
00:21:43.427,00:21:46.722,This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
00:21:46.722,00:21:49.391,So skedaddle back to where you came from.
00:21:49.391,00:21:51.727,Is there a manager we could talk to?
00:21:51.727,00:21:54.730,"Oh, I see. You're here to challenge me!"
00:21:54.730,00:21:56.523,What? No! No.
00:21:56.523,00:21:58.818,That's what it looks like to me!
00:21:58.818,00:22:00.278,Zuba! Wait.
00:22:00.278,00:22:02.155,I'm trying to take care of business...
00:22:02.155,00:22:04.824,"Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on."
00:22:05.616,00:22:07.618,Alakay?
00:22:07.618,00:22:09.036,Is that you?
00:22:09.036,00:22:12.790,"No, it's Alex. Ix."
00:22:12.790,00:22:14.792,"Zuba, look!"
00:22:14.792,00:22:17.837,The vet checked it out.
00:22:17.837,00:22:20.422,"It's kind of a beauty spot, really."
00:22:20.422,00:22:22.091,A mark.
00:22:23.217,00:22:25.803,"All right, this is a little weird."
00:22:26.637,00:22:28.806,"Honey, he's come home."
00:22:28.806,00:22:30.766,What?
00:22:30.766,00:22:32.768,You've come home.
00:22:35.771,00:22:37.564,Whoa.
00:22:41.152,00:22:42.278,Son.
00:22:48.575,00:22:49.618,Dad.
00:22:51.745,00:22:54.707,Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!
00:22:54.707,00:22:57.960,Mom and Dad!
00:22:59.253,00:23:00.671,I got a mom and dad!
00:23:00.671,00:23:02.548,My baby's alive!
00:23:02.548,00:23:04.008,Dad!
00:23:04.008,00:23:06.426,My son!
00:23:06.426,00:23:09.096,My son is home!
00:23:10.890,00:23:14.101,Alakay! Alakay has come home!
00:23:15.435,00:23:17.730,Whoo! Whoo!
00:23:17.730,00:23:22.818,Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns. This is perfect!
00:23:22.818,00:23:25.571,I thought you hated Zuba.
00:23:25.571,00:23:29.742,"No, I do. I do. I do."
00:23:29.742,00:23:32.494,"And I'm going to use Alakay, yes."
00:23:32.494,00:23:36.165,I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
00:23:36.165,00:23:37.875,"Giddy-up, feathered horse!"
00:23:37.875,00:23:40.836,Make way! Move out of the way! Stand aside!
00:23:40.836,00:23:42.671,New York!
00:23:42.671,00:23:46.759,It's a bit of a dump. Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
00:23:46.759,00:23:50.263,"Hello, New Yorkers!"
00:23:50.263,00:23:52.639,This calls for a celebration!
00:23:52.639,00:23:54.516,"Maurice, I think they like me."
00:23:54.516,00:23:57.144,You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
00:23:58.854,00:24:00.564,Chukka-chukka what?
00:24:06.695,00:24:11.117,Excuse me. I'm Marty.
00:24:14.245,00:24:16.205,Hey!
00:24:16.205,00:24:20.042,You're a good-looking group!
00:24:20.042,00:24:23.045,crack-a-lackin'.
00:24:23.045,00:24:25.672,Crack-a-lackin'.
00:24:25.672,00:24:28.801,You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
00:24:28.801,00:24:31.304,What? You don't have doctors here?
00:24:31.304,00:24:32.679,Not anymore.
00:24:32.679,00:24:35.433,"Well, what if you catch a cold?"
00:24:35.433,00:24:38.685,We go over to the dying holes and we die.
00:24:40.896,00:24:43.149,You guys really need a doctor.
00:24:43.149,00:24:46.526,"- Hey, we have an opening."
00:24:53.659,00:24:57.204,It's raining men. Hallelujah!
00:24:57.204,00:25:00.374,Why don't you have a man?
00:25:00.374,00:25:02.918,"Oh, I got rid of those."
00:25:02.918,00:25:06.213,"Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos."
00:25:06.213,00:25:09.425,"Hey, everybody!"
00:25:06.213,00:25:13.595,I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
00:25:15.348,00:25:18.184,"Show me some of your moves, son."
00:25:18.184,00:25:21.270,All right. This one always knocks 'em dead.
00:25:21.270,00:25:22.813,Roar!
00:25:22.813,00:25:26.900,Look out. The King is mad.
00:25:26.900,00:25:31.947,Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
00:25:35.659,00:25:37.453,"Welcome to the herd, Marty!"
00:25:37.453,00:25:40.747,Me? I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
00:25:40.747,00:25:43.792,- It's one for all...
00:25:43.792,00:25:46.420,- Woo-hoo!
00:25:46.420,00:25:48.506,- How do I look?
00:25:46.420,00:25:52.092,"- Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose."
00:25:52.092,00:25:55.346,- Huh?
00:25:55.346,00:25:58.391,Voila! He's a witch doctor!
00:25:58.391,00:26:00.851,My mother will be so happy.
00:26:04.646,00:26:08.692,Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.
00:26:11.195,00:26:12.654,Here he comes.
00:26:14.614,00:26:33.217,"Chunky I like 'em big I like 'em chunky I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy I like 'em round With somethin' somethin' They like my sound They think I'm funky Goodness, girl... you huge."
00:26:33.217,00:26:35.677,Who's your friend?
00:26:36.929,00:26:39.181,"Girl, you as quick as you are hefty."
00:26:39.181,00:26:41.683,So you're Moto Moto?
00:26:41.683,00:26:43.685,"The name's so nice, you say it twice."
00:26:43.685,00:26:45.687,"I kind of like it, fatso."
00:26:45.687,00:26:50.067,"I'll see you around, girl."
00:26:56.365,00:26:59.410,- Oof!
00:26:59.410,00:27:07.418,"Um, I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you were gonna banish your son."
00:27:07.418,00:27:10.754,- What are you talking about?
00:27:10.754,00:27:21.223,"They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride. It's nonsense."
00:27:21.223,00:27:23.683,I forgot about the rite of passage.
00:27:23.683,00:27:25.852,What is it? What's this rite of passage?
00:27:25.852,00:27:28.606,A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
00:27:28.606,00:27:32.276,Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
00:27:32.276,00:27:36.113,- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
00:27:36.113,00:27:39.241,A performance!
00:27:39.241,00:27:43.329,"If it's tradition, I want to do it. Strut my stuff. Earn my mane."
00:27:43.329,00:27:45.038,I want to be Alaki.
00:27:45.038,00:27:47.541,- Alakay.
00:27:47.541,00:27:50.085,We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
00:27:50.085,00:27:52.879,That's wonderful!
00:27:52.879,00:27:55.299,"Where I'm from, we say, Break a leg."
00:27:55.299,00:27:58.802,"Oh, that's my boy!"
00:28:03.890,00:28:23.869,I'm a private dancer A dancer for money Any old music will do isn't it?
00:28:28.832,00:28:30.917,...this is where we belong.
00:28:32.670,00:28:35.088,Tourist Trap is a go.
00:28:35.088,00:28:37.216,"Oh, I like that one."
00:28:37.216,00:28:38.842,It works on many levels.
00:28:38.842,00:28:40.678,You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
00:28:40.678,00:28:42.471,"- That, too."
00:28:42.471,00:28:44.348,Stations.
00:28:44.348,00:28:46.433,Stage one. Go!
00:29:00.155,00:29:02.866,"Oh, no! What have I done?"
00:29:02.866,00:29:04.368,"Come on, take the bait."
00:29:04.368,00:29:07.079,- What happened?
00:29:07.079,00:29:08.539,Is it dead?
00:29:09.789,00:29:11.917,"Stage two! Go, go, go!"
00:29:19.425,00:29:22.177,I will give him the kiss of life.
00:29:23.721,00:29:24.763,Rico!

00:29:45.951,00:29:48.621,What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!
00:29:54.543,00:29:55.794,Is she dead?
00:29:56.712,00:29:57.796,No!
00:30:05.596,00:30:07.806,You hoodlums!
00:30:09.725,00:30:11.644,Good heavens! Are you OK?
00:30:11.644,00:30:14.730,"Lady, I found your pocketbook."
00:30:14.730,00:30:18.692,My handbag. Such a good boy.
00:30:18.692,00:30:20.778,Nana can't survive without it.
00:30:20.778,00:30:23.155,Wow. You are one tough cookie.
00:30:23.155,00:30:26.158,"Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers."
00:30:26.158,00:30:29.911,"OK, nobody panic! The best thing we can do is stay together."
00:30:29.911,00:30:33.624,"We'll wait for another tour jeep. It may take hours, but..."
00:30:33.624,00:30:34.792,Where are you going?
00:30:36.376,00:30:39.004,I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
00:30:39.004,00:30:40.422,I'm too old to die.
00:30:41.423,00:30:45.177,"I don't know about you guys, but I'm going with her."
00:30:45.177,00:30:47.929,Please! We need to stay...
00:30:47.929,00:30:49.848,...together.
00:30:50.932,00:30:53.310,Fine! We'll go that way!
00:30:53.310,00:30:55.771,a hard candy?
00:30:59.733,00:31:02.653,- Easy now.
00:31:02.653,00:31:06.532,"And this, right here..."
00:31:08.367,00:31:10.910,This is where you always slept.
00:31:10.910,00:31:12.538,"Oh, man!"
00:31:13.747,00:31:14.873,Wow!
00:31:16.249,00:31:19.795,- Was this mine?
00:31:19.795,00:31:23.131,"Oh, my... Oh, this thing."
00:31:23.131,00:31:26.510,- I remember this!
00:31:26.510,00:31:28.428,Oh! A little harder than I...
00:31:28.428,00:31:32.140,You never slept on the right end. You always slept on the bottom end.
00:31:32.891,00:31:34.476,Is that...?
00:31:34.476,00:31:35.977,Is that my...?
00:31:37.688,00:31:38.980,Is that me?
00:31:38.980,00:31:41.983,Mm-hm. You had the cutest little paws.
00:31:41.983,00:31:44.903,"Little, little bitty ol' paws."
00:31:44.903,00:31:46.822,You did that the day we lost you.
00:31:46.822,00:31:48.948,Mm-hm. Yeah.
00:31:48.948,00:31:51.993,Wow. I was so young.
00:31:51.993,00:31:53.537,What happened to me?
00:31:53.537,00:31:57.957,"Mmm, it was all my fault."
00:31:57.957,00:32:00.168,- It was not your fault.
00:32:00.168,00:32:05.549,Your father did everything he could. He tracked those hunters for weeks.
00:32:05.549,00:32:07.259,Far off the reserve.
00:32:07.259,00:32:10.679,"Finally, I had to assume the hunters..."
00:32:10.679,00:32:12.097,...well...
00:32:12.097,00:32:15.601,We thought... We thought they'd killed you.
00:32:15.601,00:32:20.313,But my son fought them off!
00:32:20.313,00:32:22.148,- That's right!
00:32:22.148,00:32:26.403,You boys be careful! Watch out before you break something.
00:32:26.403,00:32:30.616,to call this foofie.
00:32:30.616,00:32:32.075,Foofie?
00:32:32.785,00:32:34.286,Foofie.
00:32:34.286,00:32:35.871,He doesn't want that thing.
00:32:35.871,00:32:37.706,This is my foofie!
00:32:40.542,00:32:42.628,"Zuba, you better give him his foofie."
00:32:42.628,00:32:47.173,"I mean, no, thank you, thank you. It's perfect."
00:32:47.173,00:32:50.677,"Son, you get your rest."
00:32:50.677,00:32:53.054,You'll need all your strength.
00:32:53.054,00:32:55.641,"I am gonna bring the house down for you, Dad."
00:32:55.641,00:32:59.603,"I hope so. Otherwise, your father will have to banish you."
00:32:59.603,00:33:01.647,"Oh, jeez, Mom, really?"
00:33:01.647,00:33:05.066,I know you'll do us proud.
00:33:06.735,00:33:08.987,You were born with it.
00:33:10.322,00:33:12.157,"Good night, Alakay."
00:33:12.157,00:33:14.827,My boy. My own boy.
00:33:17.287,00:33:19.247,My son's a king.
00:33:20.332,00:33:22.250,My son's a king.
00:33:32.385,00:33:33.846,"Good night, Mom."
00:33:34.763,00:33:36.849,"Good night, Alakay."
00:33:43.605,00:33:45.649,Foofie.
00:33:45.649,00:33:47.860,Look at foofie! My foofie!
00:33:49.486,00:33:51.571,"Foofie, foofie, foofie."
00:33:53.239,00:33:57.911,Everybody appears very tired.
00:33:57.911,00:34:00.163,I think we're lost.
00:34:00.163,00:34:02.749,"Hey, Nana, do you know where you're going?"
00:34:02.749,00:34:07.587,"No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face."
00:34:07.587,00:34:10.131,"Yeah, all right."
00:34:12.384,00:34:15.220,- It's people.
00:34:15.220,00:34:17.890,- Can you help us? We're lost.
00:34:17.890,00:34:22.728,It was awful. A flash of black and white and they were gone.
00:34:22.728,00:34:25.397,- That happened to our jeep too!
00:34:25.397,00:34:26.982,How will we all survive?
00:34:26.982,00:34:31.152,"No food, no water, no shelter."
00:34:32.988,00:34:38.702,"You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature."
00:34:40.913,00:34:44.833,"Gather 'round, children."
00:34:44.833,00:34:46.251,Yeah.
00:34:46.251,00:34:49.588,We survive the concrete jungle!
00:34:49.588,00:34:53.174,"When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand."
00:34:53.174,00:34:54.885,- Am I right?
00:34:54.885,00:34:58.471,"When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers."
00:34:58.471,00:35:03.018,- Exactly!
00:35:03.018,00:35:05.478,"We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!"
00:35:05.478,00:35:10.567,"If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!"
00:35:26.666,00:35:28.543,"I'm coming, King Julien!"
00:35:28.543,00:35:37.761,Tra-la-la la-la la-la Bad fishy! Bad fishy!
00:35:39.262,00:35:41.681,"No, shark, no! Sit!"
00:35:43.850,00:35:45.727,Why am I laughing?
00:35:49.147,00:35:53.610,"We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule."
00:35:53.610,00:35:56.154,- How slightly?
00:35:56.154,00:35:59.407,- Sixty-nine years?
00:35:59.407,00:36:02.327,Private! What happened to our thumbs?
00:36:02.327,00:36:04.579,Haven't seen them since yesterday.
00:36:04.579,00:36:06.372,"Darn you, Darwin!"
00:36:06.372,00:36:10.627,Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
00:36:12.129,00:36:14.547,Rico! You're coming with me!
00:36:14.547,00:36:18.969,- We'll bring them in for court martial.
00:36:18.969,00:36:22.639,"We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper."
00:36:29.062,00:36:31.272,"Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle."
00:36:31.272,00:36:33.191,"Oh, I doubt that."
00:36:39.447,00:36:41.950,Enough lollygagging.
00:36:41.950,00:36:43.535,We'll divide into three groups.
00:36:43.535,00:36:45.996,"Group Alpha, sheet metal fabrication."
00:36:45.996,00:36:50.375,"Group Bronson, handle assembly."
00:36:50.375,00:36:52.002,Any questions?
00:36:52.002,00:36:54.713,Good! Let's get to work.
00:37:01.803,00:37:05.057,"I'd like to kiss you, monkey man."
00:37:05.057,00:37:08.810,"All right, but you're so darn ugly."
00:37:14.649,00:37:19.278,"All right, little cub scouts, remember, a great dance performance comes from the heart."
00:37:19.278,00:37:22.824,"Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong."
00:37:24.201,00:37:25.702,"Sure, mister."
00:37:25.702,00:37:27.787,"Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by."
00:37:27.787,00:37:29.581,I thought I'd wish you luck.
00:37:29.581,00:37:33.210,"- You're not nervous, are you?"
00:37:33.210,00:37:37.089,"In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor."
00:37:37.089,00:37:40.466,"You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?"
00:37:40.466,00:37:42.719,- Like a dance-off?
00:37:42.719,00:37:45.263,Great. I love that. Freestyle.
00:37:45.263,00:37:48.641,Who'd be a good match for me?
00:37:48.641,00:37:56.108,"I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred."
00:37:56.108,00:37:59.736,But if it was me out there...
00:37:59.736,00:38:04.074,Teetsi. OK.
00:38:04.074,00:38:05.617,"Makunga, right? Thank you."
00:38:05.617,00:38:08.703,Anything for Zuba's boy.
00:38:10.205,00:38:12.832,"A five, six, seven, eight."
00:38:12.832,00:38:15.127,"Let's go, let's do this."
00:38:33.394,00:38:35.814,Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
00:38:35.814,00:38:39.358,"- Come on, baby!"
00:38:39.358,00:38:40.693,"- On it, Mom!"
00:38:40.693,00:38:42.528,Who will be the first participant?
00:38:42.528,00:38:45.448,"Me! Oh! Me, me, me!"
00:38:45.448,00:38:47.951,How about you?
00:38:47.951,00:38:49.995,Yeah. Choose your opponent.
00:38:50.829,00:38:53.290,Let me see. Hmm. Ahh.
00:38:53.290,00:38:56.001,I guess I'll pick...
00:38:58.795,00:38:59.879,...Teetsi?
00:39:01.923,00:39:04.676,Teetsi?
00:39:04.676,00:39:10.890,"That's my boy! He's got Somebody, wake him up!"
00:39:23.945,00:39:26.823,"All right, so, Teetsi, come on."
00:39:26.823,00:39:31.494,"Come on, little tsetse fly."
00:39:31.494,00:39:33.746,- Let's dance!
00:39:33.746,00:39:36.875,But let me warn you that I am a protégé of...
00:39:36.875,00:39:39.669,...Fosse and Robbins!
00:39:39.669,00:39:42.588,Not dance dance! Fight!
00:39:42.588,00:39:45.717,"Ooh, dance fight! You got it."
00:39:52.307,00:39:54.309,- Is he dancing?
00:39:54.309,00:39:56.686,I know that boy is not dancing.
00:39:56.686,00:39:59.689,even better than I thought.
00:40:02.108,00:40:03.943,"Alakay, turn around!"
00:40:03.943,00:40:08.323,"No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around."
00:40:17.957,00:40:19.834,"Oh, no."
00:40:20.752,00:40:23.380,Alakay! Are you hurt?
00:40:23.380,00:40:25.257,"Oh, yeah, I am."
00:40:25.257,00:40:27.008,Did I... did I win?
00:40:27.008,00:40:30.720,"No, son."
00:40:30.720,00:40:34.599,You told us you were a king.
00:40:34.599,00:40:39.271,I am a king.
00:40:39.271,00:40:43.316,It's my stage name.
00:40:43.316,00:40:44.943,Perform?
00:40:44.943,00:40:48.780,"Oh, no, this is horrible!"
00:40:48.780,00:40:54.244,Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish...
00:40:54.953,00:40:56.579,...his own son?
00:40:56.579,00:40:58.748,"Zuba, no."
00:40:58.748,00:41:00.708,"Zuba, yes."
00:41:00.708,00:41:04.963,"Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures."
00:41:17.350,00:41:19.811,Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
00:41:20.853,00:41:22.814,"Dad, what are you doing?"
00:41:22.814,00:41:25.984,"Dad, no! You can't do this."
00:41:27.860,00:41:30.655,Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
00:41:31.739,00:41:34.951,Anyone? Someone? No one?
00:41:35.743,00:41:37.495,"You, sir!"
00:41:37.495,00:41:39.080,I guess not.
00:41:39.080,00:41:45.962,"Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden."
00:41:45.962,00:41:47.713,Hmm.
00:41:47.713,00:41:49.966,Teetsi! Get the hat.
00:41:51.634,00:41:55.888,"As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!"
00:41:55.888,00:41:58.016,He shall wear this Hat of Shame...
00:41:58.016,00:42:03.896,"...and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!"
00:42:04.981,00:42:06.899,Whichever comes last.
00:42:09.652,00:42:12.655,"Come on! Shoo, shoo!"
00:42:12.655,00:42:17.160,"You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!"
00:42:17.160,00:42:19.578,You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
00:42:19.578,00:42:21.039,What did you expect?!
00:42:21.039,00:42:23.416,I don't know!
00:42:21.039,00:42:25.710,"Maybe a little fatherly advice, like, Hey, son, it's a fight!"
00:42:25.710,00:42:28.713,- You're a lion!
00:42:28.713,00:42:30.631,"No, I guess not. You dance!"
00:42:30.631,00:42:34.677,"And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!"
00:42:34.677,00:42:37.596,- None of this would have happened...
00:42:37.596,00:42:39.391,- Zuba!
00:42:41.017,00:42:42.935,A real lion.
00:42:43.895,00:42:45.104,Thanks.
00:42:48.441,00:42:49.901,Thanks a lot.
00:42:59.618,00:43:00.745,Saw.
00:43:02.205,00:43:03.664,Suture.
00:43:05.375,00:43:06.834,Swab.
00:43:06.834,00:43:08.503,"You're in my light, Stephen."
00:43:08.503,00:43:11.297,"Ooh, say, you've got a brown spot on your shoulder."
00:43:11.297,00:43:16.094,"That's very observant, Stephen."
00:43:16.094,00:43:19.847,OK! That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
00:43:19.847,00:43:22.517,So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
00:43:22.517,00:43:24.602,"No, you got your whole life ahead of you."
00:43:24.602,00:43:27.313,- Really?
00:43:27.313,00:43:31.192,"- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!"
00:43:31.192,00:43:33.945,This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
00:43:33.945,00:43:39.242,That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
00:43:39.242,00:43:40.493,Whoa!
00:43:40.493,00:43:42.828,- Don't ask.
00:43:42.828,00:43:45.790,won't hurt a bit.
00:43:45.790,00:43:49.835,"Joe, our last witch doctor, he had a spot just like that."
00:43:49.835,00:43:54.215,- And?
00:43:54.215,00:43:56.468,"Wednesday, no Joe?"
00:43:56.468,00:43:58.928,I can breathe!
00:43:58.928,00:44:03.266,So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
00:44:03.266,00:44:06.852,You'll find a cure.
00:44:06.852,00:44:09.021,But I've never heard of it.
00:44:09.021,00:44:12.442,I mean... I don't have any penicillin.
00:44:12.442,00:44:14.777,I'll need a CAT scan just to get started!
00:44:14.777,00:44:18.406,Have a lion look you over.
00:44:28.874,00:44:30.418,Ta-da!!
00:44:30.418,00:44:32.753,- Guy's got talent.
00:44:32.753,00:44:34.547,Hollah!
00:44:34.547,00:44:38.801,Bet you've never seen that one!
00:44:38.801,00:44:41.095,- Let's all give it a try!
00:44:41.095,00:44:45.724,"Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice."
00:44:45.724,00:44:54.400,You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
00:45:08.164,00:45:09.457,Ta-da!
00:45:13.127,00:45:16.464,How did you...? You guys got it right out of the box!
00:45:16.464,00:45:18.341,- If you can do it...
00:45:18.341,00:45:19.716,It's in our blood!
00:45:19.716,00:45:22.512,I always thought I was a little bit unique.
00:45:23.929,00:45:26.057,We are like a force of nature!
00:45:26.057,00:45:28.893,- A million points of light!
00:45:32.104,00:45:34.607,Exactly the same.
00:45:35.983,00:45:39.862,"Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?"
00:45:39.862,00:45:43.616,"Yes. If we fold it here, here and here."
00:45:45.742,00:45:46.827,Nice.
00:45:59.006,00:46:03.428,"Oh, man. My dad thinks I'm a total loser."
00:46:03.428,00:46:05.263,I've ruined my parents' lives.
00:46:05.263,00:46:07.306,That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
00:46:07.306,00:46:12.437,"It is lackin' in the crackin', my friend. I've gotta fix this."
00:46:12.437,00:46:14.522,So...
00:46:14.522,00:46:18.276,...there's... There's something I gotta tell you.
00:46:18.276,00:46:20.236,"Hey, guys."
00:46:20.236,00:46:22.238,Is this place great or what?!
00:46:22.238,00:46:24.156,I'd go with or what.
00:46:24.156,00:46:28.453,"Well, I'll tell you what. You're not gonna believe it, but... Ha!"
00:46:28.453,00:46:31.830,...I got a date with Moto Moto. Heh-heh!
00:46:31.830,00:46:33.249,Who's Moto Moto?
00:46:33.249,00:46:37.211,"Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!"
00:46:37.211,00:46:39.547,- Know what Moto Moto means?
00:46:39.547,00:46:41.674,"It means, Hot Hot."
00:46:41.674,00:46:43.008,Hot Hot?
00:46:43.008,00:46:45.470,When did you start parlez-ing African?
00:46:45.470,00:46:47.513,It's in my blood.
00:46:47.513,00:46:50.642,"Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone."
00:46:50.642,00:46:53.561,"Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?"
00:46:53.561,00:46:55.854,Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
00:46:55.854,00:46:58.650,Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
00:46:58.650,00:47:00.192,"Whoa, guys."
00:47:00.192,00:47:01.902,Main Street's mine!
00:47:01.902,00:47:04.196,"Well, you can have it!"
00:47:04.196,00:47:08.618,And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
00:47:08.618,00:47:10.495,- What are you talking about?
00:47:10.495,00:47:12.330,"Melman, just tell her."
00:47:12.330,00:47:16.417,What? What are you... I don't know what you're talking about.
00:47:16.417,00:47:17.794,"I guess I'll go, then."
00:47:17.794,00:47:19.378,Don't bother.
00:47:19.378,00:47:22.799,- Don't get up on my account.
00:47:22.799,00:47:27.428,- I thought you guys were friends!
00:47:27.428,00:47:29.430,- Marty?
00:47:29.430,00:47:31.349,Marty?
00:47:31.349,00:47:33.476,What the heck is going on?
00:47:33.476,00:47:38.439,You're not...? Oh! He was...
00:47:38.439,00:47:41.192,You thought that guy...
00:47:41.192,00:47:42.401,...was me?
00:47:42.401,00:47:45.446,"No. I mean, yes, you..."
00:47:45.446,00:47:47.782,You thought I was him?
00:47:47.782,00:47:49.866,You guys kind of do look a little...
00:47:49.866,00:47:52.787,You look a lot alike.
00:47:52.787,00:47:56.666,You laugh alike. Talk alike.
00:47:56.666,00:47:59.585,"It's a little weird, really."
00:47:59.585,00:48:03.172,So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
00:48:03.172,00:48:05.424,I'm just like any other zebra.
00:48:05.424,00:48:07.051,No. Of course you're different!
00:48:10.304,00:48:12.640,"OK, I can't tell you apart."
00:48:12.640,00:48:15.601,Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
00:48:15.601,00:48:18.646,- A bell?!
00:48:18.646,00:48:21.566,"How about a T-shirt that says, I'm with stupid?"
00:48:21.566,00:48:23.900,- I'm not stupid!
00:48:23.900,00:48:30.783,"You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse, I've been having the worst day of my life. OK?"
00:48:32.117,00:48:34.495,"It's always about you, isn't it?"
00:48:34.495,00:48:38.165,My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
00:48:38.165,00:48:41.293,I couldn't tell you apart.
00:48:41.293,00:48:44.630,"Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!"
00:48:44.630,00:48:48.050,That's what you do best!
00:48:48.050,00:48:51.512,I'm right here.
00:48:53.598,00:48:59.687,Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
00:48:59.687,00:49:03.608,"Good, leave! I don't need you to help me solve my problems!"
00:49:03.608,00:49:06.694,You're a dime a dozen!
00:49:06.694,00:49:09.946,"Which one's Marty? Wait a minute. Oh, yeah, I don't care!"
00:49:09.946,00:49:12.867,"Nice hat, you showoff!"
00:49:18.205,00:49:19.665,Marty...
00:49:20.583,00:49:22.376,...don't go.
00:49:26.963,00:49:28.633,"Look, Maurice!"
00:49:28.633,00:49:31.093,The perfect spot for my summer palace!
00:49:31.093,00:49:35.222,Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
00:49:35.222,00:49:39.393,"- Oh, who'd leave a perfectly good head?"
00:49:39.393,00:49:42.979,Tell me about it.
00:49:42.979,00:49:45.190,"I'm terminal, you know?"
00:49:45.190,00:49:49.862,"Well, I probably only have another two days left to live."
00:49:49.862,00:49:52.406,"That's a bummer, man."
00:49:52.406,00:49:55.451,"If I, King Julien..."
00:49:55.451,00:50:01.916,"...only had two days left to live, I would do all the things - I've ever dreamed of doing."
00:50:01.916,00:50:05.001,I'd love to become a professional whistler.
00:50:05.001,00:50:11.550,"I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it."
00:50:19.684,00:50:21.560,You know what else I would do?
00:50:21.560,00:50:29.025,"I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!"
00:50:29.025,00:50:31.320,Easy for you to say.
00:50:31.320,00:50:35.616,Yes. And you are only just a sad little head.
00:50:35.616,00:50:39.495,There must be something you want to do before you die!
00:50:39.495,00:50:43.457,- There is this one thing.
00:50:43.457,00:50:46.585,"- No, I couldn't."
00:50:46.585,00:50:49.171,I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
00:50:49.171,00:50:51.089,What is it?
00:50:51.089,00:50:54.969,I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
00:50:54.969,00:50:56.762,How I've always felt about her.
00:50:56.762,00:50:58.597,Fine. Don't tell me!
00:50:58.597,00:51:00.933,Ohhh! Is it a woman?
00:51:00.933,00:51:03.895,"Oh, you didn't tell me you were talking about a woman."
00:51:03.895,00:51:08.524,What are you afraid of?
00:51:08.524,00:51:10.735,Yeah. Yeah.
00:51:10.735,00:51:12.737,- You're right.
00:51:12.737,00:51:15.907,You've got to march right up to this woman.
00:51:15.907,00:51:19.744,Look her right in the eye.
00:51:19.744,00:51:22.496,"Just a little, or almost all the way."
00:51:22.496,00:51:26.500,Then you let her lean forward a little until you're...
00:51:26.500,00:51:29.921,...just lips' distance away from each other.
00:51:29.921,00:51:33.799,Then you tell her how much you hate her.
00:51:33.799,00:51:38.345,"Actually, it's more like love her."
00:51:38.345,00:51:41.515,"Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof!"
00:51:41.515,00:51:44.936,You're a real player.
00:51:44.936,00:51:47.730,You got to rise up.
00:51:47.730,00:51:49.356,- He didn't hear you.
00:51:49.356,00:51:50.691,- Yeah.
00:51:50.691,00:51:52.902,- You got to rise up!
00:51:52.902,00:51:56.196,- Get out of the hole!
00:51:56.196,00:51:58.365,"- He's rising, Maurice."
00:51:58.365,00:52:01.326,- Rising!
00:52:01.326,00:52:03.579,- Yeah!
00:52:03.579,00:52:06.040,- Go up to her face!
00:52:06.040,00:52:11.169,- I'm going to tell her!
00:52:11.169,00:52:14.339,Yeah! I'm gonna do it!
00:52:14.339,00:52:17.051,I love that happy little head.
00:52:17.885,00:52:52.962,She love Moto Moto She love Moto Moto She loves me She loves my eyes She loves me She loves my thighs She loves my roundness She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy She love my heftiness She love my zestiness She love me restlessly She love me forever She love me 'Cause she love me Moto Moto...
00:52:52.962,00:53:00.636,"...before things get too serious, well, I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here..."
00:53:00.636,00:53:02.638,...I'd like to ask you...
00:53:02.638,00:53:06.767,Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
00:53:06.767,00:53:09.687,"Well, I have so many questions."
00:53:09.687,00:53:13.149,I promise the answer will always be yes.
00:53:13.149,00:53:16.027,Unless no is required.
00:53:16.027,00:53:20.948,So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
00:53:20.948,00:53:23.993,You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
00:53:23.993,00:53:25.995,OK. Other than that.
00:53:25.995,00:53:27.621,Let's see.
00:53:27.621,00:53:30.749,"Yeah, well, you know..."
00:53:31.583,00:53:33.335,Right.
00:53:33.335,00:53:37.506,"Uh... My gosh, girl, you huge."
00:53:37.506,00:53:38.632,You said that.
00:53:38.632,00:53:41.635,"Oh... Yeah, that's right."
00:53:41.635,00:53:43.804,We don't have to talk no more.
00:53:43.804,00:53:46.057,Gloria!
00:53:46.057,00:53:47.391,Gloria.
00:53:47.391,00:53:48.767,Melman.
00:53:50.019,00:53:54.690,"Um, Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto."
00:53:54.690,00:53:59.945,"Ah, Moto Moto."
00:53:59.945,00:54:03.657,"- Well, I guess I..."
00:54:03.657,00:54:05.241,Apology accepted.
00:54:05.241,00:54:09.997,"Oh. Yeah, right, yes, that."
00:54:09.997,00:54:13.542,"Whoo! OK. Well, that's it, then."
00:54:13.542,00:54:16.754,"Good. We're kind of busy here, man."
00:54:16.754,00:54:19.673,"No. No, that's not it."
00:54:21.217,00:54:24.136,"Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen."
00:54:24.136,00:54:27.681,"Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman."
00:54:27.681,00:54:34.354,"If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman, I'd give her flowers every day."
00:54:34.354,00:54:38.358,Her favorites are orchids.
00:54:38.358,00:54:40.861,"Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides."
00:54:40.861,00:54:42.529,"No crust, the way she likes it."
00:54:42.529,00:54:46.200,I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
00:54:46.200,00:54:49.787,I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
00:54:49.787,00:54:53.707,She has the most amazing laugh.
00:54:56.668,00:55:00.172,That's what I would do if I were you.
00:55:00.172,00:55:02.800,"But I'm not, so you do it."
00:55:03.884,00:55:05.803,OK.
00:55:06.720,00:55:07.972,What?
00:55:08.889,00:55:11.516,That was beautiful.
00:55:12.350,00:55:14.853,"Anyways, where were we?"
00:55:14.853,00:55:17.022,I'm huge?
00:55:18.523,00:55:20.276,"Surprised to see me, Makunga?"
00:55:20.276,00:55:23.612,"Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!"
00:55:23.612,00:55:27.825,Is this real enough for you?
00:55:27.825,00:55:34.748,This is for stealing my dad's job! This is for humiliating my family and making me look like a fool!
00:55:51.890,00:55:54.350,"Had enough? Sure, fly away!"
00:55:54.350,00:55:55.936,Coward.
00:56:07.198,00:56:09.783,The water. It's gone.
00:56:09.783,00:56:11.827,It's never gone dry before.
00:56:11.827,00:56:14.788,- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
00:56:14.788,00:56:17.875,Out of my way!
00:56:17.875,00:56:20.836,The watering hole is dry!
00:56:20.836,00:56:23.505,"- Good observation, Shirley."
00:56:23.505,00:56:24.798,"Makunga, what do we do?"
00:56:24.798,00:56:26.925,Quiet!
00:56:26.925,00:56:34.766,Listen up! I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis: We'll all have to fight for it.
00:56:34.766,00:56:37.353,- We can't fight for it.
00:56:38.854,00:56:40.396,That's not fair. You'd win!
00:56:40.396,00:56:41.523,"Exactly, Shirley."
00:56:41.523,00:56:43.441,- I'm Bob...
00:56:43.441,00:56:50.324,"Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair. I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion."
00:56:50.324,00:56:53.702,"Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve."
00:56:53.702,00:56:57.956,"If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve."
00:57:02.086,00:57:04.171,the reserve and survives!
00:57:04.171,00:57:06.464,I left the reserve!
00:57:06.464,00:57:08.259,And survived.
00:57:09.301,00:57:11.427,I can do something about this.
00:57:11.427,00:57:16.016,"Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York."
00:57:16.016,00:57:18.102,- Upriver?
00:57:20.062,00:57:23.399,"Yeah, me. I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water."
00:57:23.399,00:57:34.285,"Great! I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, Fine. Go ahead, laugh."
00:57:34.285,00:57:37.579,Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
00:57:43.210,00:57:44.795,would know what to do.
00:57:44.795,00:57:47.047,- Where's Zuba?
00:57:47.047,00:57:49.049,"Zuba should be in charge, not you."
00:57:53.887,00:57:55.555,"All right, fine!"
00:57:55.555,00:57:58.809,"As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!"
00:58:05.732,00:58:07.234,Marty?
00:58:16.160,00:58:18.036,Hey! Marty!
00:58:22.749,00:58:24.209,Marty?
00:58:27.171,00:58:28.839,Marty.
00:58:28.839,00:58:30.757,Where'd you get the fruity hat?
00:58:30.757,00:58:32.717,Excuse me! Excuse me!
00:58:32.717,00:58:36.054,Hi. Is Marty in there?
00:58:36.054,00:58:38.974,Anyone seen Marty?
00:58:40.976,00:58:42.936,Which one of us is Marty?
00:58:42.936,00:58:48.692,"Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye."
00:58:48.692,00:58:51.445,Goodbye? Don't go.
00:58:51.445,00:58:54.823,- Can we come?
00:58:54.823,00:58:57.159,You can't leave the reserve!
00:59:08.170,00:59:10.130,What are you doing?
00:59:10.130,00:59:12.549,- They'll get your hat.
00:59:14.801,00:59:16.761,Marty! I know you're in there.
00:59:18.055,00:59:20.932,"Before I go, I got something I want to say."
00:59:21.975,00:59:23.894,You've been a great friend.
00:59:23.894,00:59:29.649,You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you as having any.
00:59:31.068,00:59:33.737,I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
00:59:33.737,00:59:35.989,Just like back at the zoo.
00:59:35.989,00:59:40.411,What kind of friend does that make me?
00:59:41.745,00:59:43.497,I just want you to know that I...
00:59:44.373,00:59:46.750,You're one in a million.
00:59:46.750,00:59:48.793,This is just touching.
00:59:48.793,00:59:50.421,It is touching.
00:59:50.421,00:59:53.965,So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
00:59:53.965,00:59:56.718,That's right. Gotcha!
00:59:56.718,00:59:59.679,I see you in there!
00:59:59.679,01:00:01.639,"You, right there."
01:00:01.639,01:00:05.769,"Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left."
01:00:05.769,01:00:07.521,"That's you, Marty."
01:00:07.521,01:00:09.523,I know it's you.
01:00:11.233,01:00:13.569,Know what makes you special?
01:00:13.569,01:00:18.240,These guys are white with black stripes.
01:00:18.240,01:00:19.950,"You're a dreamer, Marty."
01:00:19.950,01:00:23.995,Always have been.
01:00:19.950,01:00:26.790,You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
01:00:26.790,01:00:30.127,"Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me."
01:00:32.463,01:00:33.755,"OK, I'm in."
01:00:33.755,01:00:36.258,"No, Marty, you can't come with me."
01:00:36.258,01:00:38.135,I don't believe you have a choice.
01:00:42.680,01:00:45.850,Come back!
01:00:45.850,01:00:47.811,The people will get you!
01:00:55.902,01:00:57.112,Any water?
01:00:58.071,01:01:00.782,"No, just more diamonds and gold."
01:01:06.037,01:01:07.456,Don't give up hope.
01:01:07.456,01:01:10.334,Listen up! I will help you!
01:01:10.334,01:01:13.795,There's only one way to get your precious water.
01:01:13.795,01:01:25.265,"I, your beloved King Julien, must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!"
01:01:28.644,01:01:29.978,What does that do?
01:01:29.978,01:01:32.772,What does that do?
01:01:32.772,01:01:36.193,My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
01:01:36.193,01:01:40.030,The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
01:01:40.030,01:01:42.782,Mmm. Very nice.
01:01:42.782,01:01:45.785,"Here, have another."
01:01:45.785,01:01:47.996,I'll be insulted unless you have another.
01:01:47.996,01:01:50.541,I don't want another sacrifice!
01:01:50.541,01:01:53.918,Look at you! You're skinny!
01:01:56.129,01:01:59.383,The gods eat the sacrifice.
01:01:59.383,01:02:03.428,"They give me some water, and then I give it to you."
01:02:03.428,01:02:04.846,What?
01:02:04.846,01:02:06.431,Does it work?
01:02:06.431,01:02:09.518,"No! I mean, yes."
01:02:09.518,01:02:11.269,"Well, Maurice?"
01:02:11.269,01:02:13.813,"Ah, it's fifty-fifty."
01:02:14.690,01:02:16.608,We'll do it!
01:02:17.526,01:02:19.361,Excellent!
01:02:19.361,01:02:25.534,Now all I need is someone who would like to go in the volcano and get eaten by gods.
01:02:25.534,01:02:28.870,"Any hands? Hands, anybody!"
01:02:28.870,01:02:37.588,"I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball."
01:02:37.588,01:02:39.881,- I'll do it.
01:02:49.099,01:02:53.061,Hurry up! Before we all come to our senses!
01:02:54.020,01:02:56.273,"Melman, what is wrong with you?"
01:02:56.273,01:03:01.152,I'm dying anyway.
01:03:01.152,01:03:03.071,Are you nuts?
01:03:03.071,01:03:09.453,"I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going."
01:03:09.453,01:03:11.663,It was always you.
01:03:11.663,01:03:13.998,Seeing you every day.
01:03:13.998,01:03:16.334,That's what kept me going.
01:03:20.088,01:03:22.173,Melman! Wait!
01:03:23.341,01:03:27.845,Melman! Melman! Melman!
01:03:30.474,01:03:33.101,You going to mope like this all day?
01:03:33.101,01:03:34.185,Hmph.
01:03:34.185,01:03:35.562,Don't hmph me.
01:03:35.562,01:03:39.232,"Listen, Zuba."
01:03:39.232,01:03:44.195,Our son has come back to us.
01:03:44.195,01:03:47.198,"What are you saying, woman?"
01:03:47.198,01:03:51.578,"We lost him once, Zuba."
01:04:00.920,01:04:03.131,Zuba!
01:04:03.131,01:04:05.049,- Zuba!
01:04:05.049,01:04:06.426,What do you want?
01:04:06.426,01:04:08.345,It's awful.
01:04:08.345,01:04:10.013,The watering hole is dried up.
01:04:10.013,01:04:13.141,Dried up?
01:04:13.141,01:04:14.976,There's nothing left!
01:04:14.976,01:04:18.814,"You're alpha lion, Makunga."
01:04:18.814,01:04:23.234,"Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it. He's gone upriver."
01:04:23.234,01:04:24.778,- Off the reserve?!
01:04:24.778,01:04:27.781,I tried to stop him.
01:04:27.781,01:04:29.991,He was determined to prove himself to you.
01:04:31.159,01:04:34.162,"You stay here, in case he comes back!"
01:04:36.832,01:04:38.416,"Hurry, Zuba!"
01:04:41.753,01:04:43.380,I'm so parched.
01:04:48.719,01:04:51.888,starting to freak you out?
01:04:51.888,01:04:56.852,"We'll slip in, find the problem. Hunters will never know we were here."
01:04:56.852,01:04:58.729,Why are we doing this?
01:04:58.729,01:05:02.691,"Look, Marty, maybe my dad will think I'm..."
01:05:02.691,01:05:05.068,I just want to show him I'm a real lion.
01:05:05.068,01:05:08.154,As opposed to a chocolate lion.
01:05:08.154,01:05:13.660,"Shh! I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance."
01:05:13.660,01:05:15.704,- What?!
01:05:15.704,01:05:17.622,As far as my dad is concerned.
01:05:17.622,01:05:20.667,"As far as people are concerned, you're a huge hit."
01:05:20.667,01:05:23.712,"That was New York. This is Africa, a much tougher crowd."
01:05:23.712,01:05:26.715,"- Marty, this is it!"
01:05:26.715,01:05:30.635,- This is the clog! Come on.
01:05:35.348,01:05:36.558,- Ahhh.
01:05:36.558,01:05:38.852,"Well, there's the water."
01:05:40.771,01:05:43.565,Stay down. Look at that.
01:05:47.235,01:05:48.986,- Is this right?
01:05:48.986,01:05:50.822,"Nana, slow down."
01:05:50.822,01:05:53.658,"You're a little tangled, aren't you?"
01:05:53.658,01:05:56.870,"No, don't pull. I'll do it."
01:05:56.870,01:05:58.705,We need dynamite.
01:05:58.705,01:06:02.918,"Oh, snap! I just used my last stick this morning!"
01:06:05.044,01:06:07.088,- Savages!
01:06:07.088,01:06:09.758,"- Serpentine, serpentine!"
01:06:09.758,01:06:12.969,"Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!"
01:06:12.969,01:06:15.430,"No, no! Squiggly squid!"
01:06:15.430,01:06:16.807,Etch A Sketch!
01:06:16.807,01:06:19.893,That's too complex!
01:06:19.893,01:06:21.645,Alex!
01:06:21.645,01:06:25.857,"- Run, Marty!"
01:06:25.857,01:06:29.653,Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver! Go! Go!
01:06:29.653,01:06:32.739,Etch A Sketch!
01:06:33.615,01:06:38.453,Save us We love you OK.
01:06:38.453,01:06:41.122,"OK, OK, OK."
01:06:47.921,01:06:55.178,"- Save us - Melman - We love you - Melman Save us OK, here we go. OK, OK."
01:06:55.178,01:07:01.643,- Melman - We love you - Melman - Save us Here we go! Here we go!
01:07:01.643,01:07:04.855,- What's all the hoopla about?
01:07:04.855,01:07:07.524,Joe the Witch Doctor?
01:07:07.524,01:07:11.528,So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
01:07:11.528,01:07:14.238,So Melman's not dying!
01:07:14.238,01:07:17.617,"- Oh, no!"
01:07:17.617,01:07:18.952,Melman!
01:07:18.952,01:07:20.453,Move!
01:07:20.453,01:07:24.499,"Don't do this! Julien, stop this! This is crazy!"
01:07:24.499,01:07:29.504,"Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!"
01:07:29.504,01:07:30.588,Yes!
01:07:32.924,01:07:36.887,"- Please, Melman! Stop!"
01:07:36.887,01:07:39.389,- You can't do this!
01:07:39.389,01:07:40.640,Because... Oh!
01:07:59.826,01:08:01.912,"You can't do this, Melman."
01:08:01.912,01:08:03.705,"First, that hurts."
01:08:03.705,01:08:07.000,"Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway."
01:08:07.000,01:08:09.586,"Melman, I gotta know..."
01:08:10.921,01:08:13.381,...did you mean those things you said about me?
01:08:14.298,01:08:15.508,Of course I did.
01:08:15.508,01:08:18.177,- That's crazy.
01:08:20.597,01:08:24.183,It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world...
01:08:25.518,01:08:30.189,...to find out that the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
01:08:31.274,01:08:33.568,"Then it's you and me, neighbor."
01:08:33.568,01:08:36.571,You and me for the next 18 hours.
01:08:36.571,01:08:39.198,I'll take whatever you got.
01:08:42.911,01:08:46.205,"- Maurice, what happened?"
01:08:46.205,01:08:49.333,"- Hey, what's going on here?"
01:08:49.333,01:08:53.463,Listen up! Alex is in big trouble! We got to get upriver fast!
01:08:53.463,01:08:55.799,- What about the plane?
01:08:58.384,01:09:02.430,The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
01:09:02.430,01:09:04.223,"Now, about maternity leave."
01:09:04.223,01:09:07.685,Maternity leave?
01:09:07.685,01:09:10.396,We need that plane for a rescue mission.
01:09:10.396,01:09:13.316,There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
01:09:13.316,01:09:16.527,I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
01:09:16.527,01:09:21.282,Can't you see these commies have my hands tied?
01:09:23.493,01:09:29.582,Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna. Hmm?
01:09:37.757,01:09:40.760,All right. You get your maternity leave.
01:09:41.928,01:09:43.387,Finally.
01:09:47.809,01:09:51.270,Where we headed? What's going on? Where are we going?
01:09:51.270,01:09:55.316,"Oh, no! Please!"
01:09:55.316,01:09:56.985,This is wrong.
01:09:56.985,01:10:00.780,You see? You are survivors.
01:10:00.780,01:10:04.742,"Now, how about a nice lion casserole?"
01:10:04.742,01:10:06.536,You can't eat a lion.
01:10:06.536,01:10:08.579,"Eh! Don't worry, it tastes like chicken."
01:10:08.579,01:10:10.790,"No, no, no. Don't listen to her."
01:10:11.791,01:10:13.793,"She's out of her mind, people!"
01:10:14.794,01:10:16.212,Hey! Hey!
01:10:16.212,01:10:17.672,I'm from New York City too!
01:10:17.672,01:10:20.508,"It's me, Alex the lion!"
01:10:27.932,01:10:29.809,Dad!
01:10:29.809,01:10:34.230,"What were you thinking, son? You got no business being out here!"
01:10:35.982,01:10:37.901,This is it.
01:10:37.901,01:10:41.362,They're New Yorkers. They're just rude and frightened people.
01:10:41.362,01:10:42.780,Stay back!
01:10:42.780,01:10:45.241,You gonna let your dinner get away?
01:10:51.455,01:10:54.959,- What are you doing?
01:10:54.959,01:10:56.419,Huh?
01:10:56.419,01:11:00.256,I been around the world in the pouring rain What the heck?
01:11:00.256,01:11:09.140,Feeling out of place and feeling strange Take me to a place where they know my name Alex?
01:11:10.600,01:11:12.560,"Check it, check it out..."
01:11:16.606,01:11:19.316,Only one lion can move like that!
01:11:20.860,01:11:25.907,"Play a little jam I'll come Alive, alive, alive He's beautiful."
01:11:25.907,01:11:27.324,I can't believe it.
01:11:27.324,01:11:36.167,Play that jungle fever Show 'em some love How does he do that?
01:11:38.086,01:11:50.473,"This is my home This is my home King of the throne This is my home This is my home This is my home Dad, what are you doing?"
01:11:50.473,01:11:53.517,I'm dancing with my son!
01:11:53.517,01:11:54.978,"Don't think, Dad. Feel!"
01:11:55.895,01:11:57.814,Butterfly!
01:12:00.275,01:12:02.277,I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!
01:12:03.153,01:12:29.220,But now that I'm home Feels like I'm in heaven Oh! That was beautiful.
01:12:29.220,01:12:30.805,"Dad, look out!"
01:12:32.849,01:12:34.142,What the...?
01:12:34.142,01:12:35.810,Alex! Get in!
01:12:35.810,01:12:39.814,She's got a gun!
