00:00:19.854,00:00:26.819,"Long ago, in ancient China, the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City."
00:00:26.944,00:00:34.451,"They brought great joy and prosperity to the city, for they had invented fireworks."
00:00:37.997,00:00:44.670,"But their son, Lord Shen, saw darker power in the fireworks."
00:00:44.795,00:00:52.636,"What had brought color and joy, could also bring darkness and destruction."
00:00:52.761,00:00:56.515,Shen's troubled parents consulted a soothsayer.
00:00:56.640,00:01:07.609,She foretold that if Shen continued down this dark path he would be defeated by a warrior of black and white.
00:01:07.735,00:01:11.947,The young lord set out to change his fate.
00:01:12.072,00:01:14.241,But what he did next...
00:01:14.366,00:01:17.619,...only sealed it.
00:01:21.206,00:01:25.627,"Shen returned to his parents, full of pride."
00:01:25.753,00:01:30.424,"But in their faces, he saw only horror."
00:01:31.800,00:01:34.887,He was banished from the city forever.
00:01:35.012,00:01:38.223,But Shen swore revenge.
00:01:38.348,00:01:45.439,"Someday he would return, and all of China would bow at his feet."
00:02:16.470,00:02:21.100,"It's almost done, Lord Shen, but we've run out of metal."
00:02:21.224,00:02:25.562,Search the farthest villages!
00:02:25.687,00:02:27.982,China will be mine.
00:02:37.825,00:02:41.161,And then the Dragon Warrior joined the Furious Five!
00:02:41.286,00:02:44.331,And they became the most awesomest kung fu team ever!
00:02:44.456,00:02:45.833,Enough talk. Let's fight!
00:02:45.958,00:02:47.334,- Yah!
00:02:47.459,00:02:48.877,"Listen, listen."
00:02:49.003,00:02:50.629,You can hear the Dragon Warrior training right now!
00:02:53.007,00:02:54.675,- It's too dangerous!
00:02:54.800,00:02:58.345,- Stay focused!
00:02:58.470,00:03:00.722,How is he doing that with his face?
00:03:07.479,00:03:09.982,Yes! New record!
00:03:10.107,00:03:12.860,- Keep going! Hit 40!
00:03:12.985,00:03:14.862,we'll get to 40!
00:03:14.987,00:03:16.071,Do it.
00:03:16.195,00:03:18.197,No problem!
00:03:18.323,00:03:19.867,Yeah!
00:03:20.742,00:03:22.410,Yeah!!
00:03:25.706,00:03:27.332,- Yeah!
00:03:27.457,00:03:29.543,- Yes!
00:03:29.668,00:03:31.252,"Well done, Po!"
00:03:31.378,00:03:33.588,- Your training has paid off.
00:03:33.714,00:03:35.674,"- Oh, Master Shifu!"
00:03:35.799,00:03:38.218,- Gotta go. See you later!
00:03:38.343,00:03:40.554,"You'll save those for me, right?"
00:04:00.741,00:04:02.159,Inner peace.
00:04:04.661,00:04:07.706,- Inner peace.
00:04:13.212,00:04:15.422,Master Shifu.
00:04:15.547,00:04:17.632,"Master Shifu, what do we got?"
00:04:17.758,00:04:20.468,Pirates?
00:04:20.594,00:04:24.890,"Whatever it is, I will take them down, 'cause I am in a mood."
00:04:25.015,00:04:28.309,"I need to get something done, you know what I mean?"
00:04:28.435,00:04:30.311,"Uh, what are you doing?"
00:04:30.437,00:04:34.691,One of Master Oogway's final teachings.
00:05:06.598,00:05:08.976,How did you do that?
00:05:09.101,00:05:10.978,Inner peace.
00:05:11.103,00:05:14.355,Inner piece. That's cool.
00:05:14.481,00:05:16.108,Inner piece of what?
00:05:16.233,00:05:17.943,It is the next phase of your training.
00:05:18.068,00:05:24.574,Every master must find his path to inner peace.
00:05:24.699,00:05:29.163,Some choose to meditate for 50 years in a cave just like this...
00:05:30.580,00:05:33.500,...without the slightest taste of food or water.
00:05:35.335,00:05:36.920,Or?
00:05:37.045,00:05:40.174,Some find it through pain and suffering as I did.
00:05:40.299,00:05:45.637,"Po, the day you were chosen as Dragon Warrior was the worst day of my life."
00:05:45.762,00:05:47.181,By far.
00:05:47.306,00:05:48.807,Nothing else came close.
00:05:48.932,00:05:53.603,"It was the worst, most painful, mind-destroying, horrible moment..."
00:05:53.728,00:05:56.481,- OK.
00:06:00.277,00:06:10.162,"But once I realized the problem was not you, but within me, I found inner peace, and was able to harness the flow of the universe."
00:06:10.287,00:06:12.789,So that's it?
00:06:12.914,00:06:18.503,"My innards are already super, super peaceful, so all I need to do is just get this thing going."
00:06:18.628,00:06:20.881,"Inner peace, you're going down."
00:06:21.006,00:06:22.590,Now show me what you were doing there with your feet.
00:06:22.716,00:06:24.259,I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...
00:06:24.383,00:06:25.760,Po! Bandits!
00:06:25.886,00:06:27.012,Approaching the musicians' village.
00:06:27.137,00:06:28.763,Danger.
00:06:27.137,00:06:32.684,"Tell those musicians to start playing some action music, because it is on."
00:06:32.809,00:06:34.811,"Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master inner peace as soon as I get back."
00:06:34.936,00:06:37.480,- No snack stops this time.
00:06:37.605,00:06:39.858,Snack stops.
00:06:39.983,00:06:41.860,"Wait, are you serious?"
00:06:53.663,00:06:57.125,Get all the metal you can find!
00:07:00.379,00:07:02.547,Grab the metal!
00:07:05.800,00:07:09.054,"- Help, help, help, help!"
00:07:12.766,00:07:14.809,That's everything!
00:07:14.935,00:07:15.894,OK.
00:07:16.019,00:07:17.396,"- Oh, no."
00:07:22.359,00:07:26.321,Wings of Justice!
00:07:30.409,00:07:32.327,Po!
00:07:32.452,00:07:34.746,Yee-hah!
00:07:38.792,00:07:40.961,- Hmm?
00:07:41.086,00:07:42.379,Ha-ha!
00:07:42.503,00:07:44.464,- The Dragon Warrior!
00:07:44.589,00:07:47.175,The panda?
00:07:47.301,00:07:49.094,My fist hungers for justice.
00:07:50.553,00:07:52.306,- That was my... fist.
00:07:52.431,00:07:53.432,Get 'em!
00:07:53.556,00:07:56.101,- Come on!
00:08:17.872,00:08:19.499,Take that!
00:08:29.801,00:08:31.345,Po! Incoming!
00:08:31.470,00:08:32.679,"Thanks, Mantis!"
00:08:51.698,00:08:53.908,"Tigress, Double Death Strike!"
00:09:02.334,00:09:04.919,- Feet of Fury!
00:09:08.006,00:09:09.257,Tigress!
00:09:09.383,00:09:10.258,Monkey!
00:09:10.384,00:09:12.302,Viper! Mantis!
00:09:12.427,00:09:15.055,- Bunny! What?
00:09:15.180,00:09:16.597,"Oh, sorry."
00:09:24.105,00:09:26.733,"- Crane, go!"
00:09:29.236,00:09:30.904,Ahh!
00:09:31.988,00:09:33.281,Hoo!
00:09:33.823,00:09:35.783,Whoa!
00:09:45.710,00:09:47.421,Is everyone OK?
00:09:47.546,00:09:50.006,- Awesome!
00:09:52.259,00:09:53.885,I got this.
00:10:04.645,00:10:05.939,Po!
00:10:07.815,00:10:09.109,Oof!
00:10:12.529,00:10:13.988,"Chew on that, tubby!"
00:10:14.114,00:10:15.907,"Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha!"
00:10:17.451,00:10:19.327,"Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha!"
00:10:23.915,00:10:26.167,- Are you OK?
00:10:27.627,00:10:29.337,I think I saw...
00:10:29.463,00:10:32.924,I think... I gotta go.
00:10:35.135,00:10:36.803,Thank you.
00:10:35.135,00:10:41.015,Thank you for coming to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.
00:10:41.141,00:10:42.976,- More tea? Lemon sauce?
00:10:43.101,00:10:46.771,"If you need anything, just ask."
00:10:46.896,00:10:49.023,- Thank you.
00:10:49.149,00:10:52.193,"Ah, the Dragon Warrior's mop."
00:10:52.319,00:10:53.945,He mopped these very floors!
00:10:54.070,00:10:58.533,"Uh, uh... No touching!"
00:10:58.658,00:11:00.285,- He once waited on me.
00:11:00.410,00:11:01.744,"Yeah, I have the stain to prove it."
00:11:01.869,00:11:04.331,"Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?"
00:11:04.456,00:11:07.041,He doesn't work here anymore.
00:11:07.167,00:11:09.919,He's busy out there protecting the Valley.
00:11:10.044,00:11:12.255,- There he is.
00:11:12.380,00:11:14.424,- Po!
00:11:15.049,00:11:16.384,"Uh... Uh, here."
00:11:16.510,00:11:18.136,"- OK, OK."
00:11:18.261,00:11:19.387,You should have told me you were coming.
00:11:19.513,00:11:20.930,"Hi, Dad."
00:11:21.055,00:11:22.723,I would have saved you some stinky tofu.
00:11:22.849,00:11:24.392,Uh... Uh...
00:11:24.518,00:11:28.229,"- Dad, can I talk to you?"
00:11:28.355,00:11:32.733,"In honor of my son, free tofu dessert for everybody!"
00:11:32.859,00:11:34.777,- With purchases.
00:11:36.154,00:11:39.824,"Oh, it's so good to see you, Po."
00:11:39.949,00:11:43.662,Have you lost weight? I can almost put my wings around you.
00:11:43.786,00:11:45.246,"Ah, well, maybe a little."
00:11:45.372,00:11:47.582,"Poor you, you must feel weak."
00:11:47.706,00:11:50.168,- Let me get you some soup.
00:11:50.293,00:11:52.587,- I'm not hungry.
00:11:52.711,00:11:54.172,"Po, are you all right?"
00:11:54.297,00:11:55.840,"Yeah. No, I'm fine."
00:11:55.965,00:11:58.343,"Earlier today, I was fighting these bandits."
00:11:58.468,00:12:00.928,- Uh-huh.
00:12:01.054,00:12:02.847,"- They were just, you know..."
00:12:02.972,00:12:05.099,And then the strangest thing happened.
00:12:05.225,00:12:07.185,I had this crazy vision.
00:12:07.310,00:12:10.355,I think I saw my mom and me... as a baby.
00:12:10.480,00:12:13.608,What? Huh?
00:12:13.732,00:12:18.112,"- Um, Dad?"
00:12:18.238,00:12:20.448,- What...?
00:12:21.949,00:12:24.244,Where did I come from?
00:12:27.830,00:12:33.587,"Well, you see, uh, son, baby geese come from a little egg."
00:12:33.712,00:12:35.796,Don't ask me where the egg comes from.
00:12:35.922,00:12:38.799,"Dad, that's not what I meant."
00:12:39.926,00:12:42.011,I know it's not.
00:12:42.136,00:12:47.392,I think it's time I told you something I should have told you a long time ago.
00:12:48.184,00:12:49.436,OK.
00:12:49.561,00:12:52.313,You might have been kind of...
00:12:52.439,00:12:55.149,...a... a... a...
00:12:56.775,00:12:58.319,...adopted.
00:12:58.445,00:13:00.572,- I knew it.
00:13:00.697,00:13:03.742,"- Well, who told you?"
00:13:03.866,00:13:06.620,"But if you knew, why didn't you ever say anything?"
00:13:06.745,00:13:08.913,Why didn't you say anything?
00:13:10.915,00:13:13.918,"How did I get here, Dad?"
00:13:15.462,00:13:19.090,"Actually, you came from this."
00:13:22.801,00:13:25.722,It was just another day at the restaurant.
00:13:25.846,00:13:28.099,Time to make the noodles.
00:13:28.224,00:13:32.687,I went out to the back where my vegetables had just been delivered.
00:13:32.811,00:13:35.814,"There were cabbages, turnips, radishes."
00:13:36.775,00:13:39.277,Only there were no radishes...
00:13:39.402,00:13:43.197,...just a very hungry baby panda.
00:13:44.240,00:13:45.575,Whee!
00:13:45.700,00:13:47.368,There was no note.
00:13:47.494,00:13:49.746,"Of course, you could have eaten it."
00:13:49.870,00:13:54.751,I waited for someone to come looking for you but no one did.
00:14:23.321,00:14:25.031,Fed you.
00:14:26.324,00:14:28.159,Gave you a bath.
00:14:30.870,00:14:33.498,And fed you again.
00:14:35.333,00:14:37.794,And again.
00:14:39.212,00:14:42.173,And tried to put some pants on you.
00:14:50.598,00:14:54.227,And then I made a decision that would change my life forever.
00:14:56.354,00:14:59.982,To make my soup without radishes...
00:15:00.107,00:15:04.237,...and to raise you as my own son.
00:15:04.362,00:15:08.115,"Xiao Po, my little panda."
00:15:08.241,00:15:17.417,"And from that moment on, both my soup and my life have been that much sweeter."
00:15:17.542,00:15:20.754,"And, little Po, that's the end of the story."
00:15:20.879,00:15:23.089,Ha! Look at me.
00:15:23.214,00:15:24.965,"No, don't look at me."
00:15:25.091,00:15:28.177,That's it? That can't be it.
00:15:28.302,00:15:29.929,"There's gotta be more, Dad!"
00:15:30.054,00:15:34.016,"Well, there was the time you ate all my bamboo furniture."
00:15:34.141,00:15:36.561,"It was imported, too."
00:15:36.686,00:15:39.480,"One dumpling, please, Dragon Warrior size."
00:15:44.903,00:15:50.533,"Oh, Po, your story may not have such a happy beginning, but look how it turned out."
00:15:50.658,00:15:52.993,You got me. You got kung fu.
00:15:53.119,00:15:54.328,And you got noodles.
00:15:54.454,00:15:57.248,I know. I just have so many questions.
00:15:57.373,00:15:59.876,"Like, how did I ever fit in this tiny basket?"
00:16:00.000,00:16:01.836,Why didn't I like pants?
00:16:03.963,00:16:06.173,And who am I?
00:16:13.097,00:16:15.308,Watch your form.
00:16:17.769,00:16:19.437,Good.
00:16:20.814,00:16:23.608,Better. Elbow.
00:16:23.733,00:16:25.985,Straighten it out!
00:16:51.845,00:16:53.680,Shen?
00:16:53.805,00:16:56.683,"Good afternoon, gentlemen."
00:16:56.808,00:17:01.813,"Now we've got the pleasantries out of the way, please leave my house."
00:17:01.938,00:17:03.857,- Your house?
00:17:03.982,00:17:07.735,Didn't you see the peacock on the front door?
00:17:07.861,00:17:10.780,"Ah, there you are, Soothsayer."
00:17:10.905,00:17:16.202,It seems your fortune-telling skills are not as good as you thought.
00:17:16.327,00:17:20.122,"- We shall see, Shen."
00:17:20.247,00:17:23.209,- Where were we?
00:17:23.334,00:17:26.253,What is rightfully mine.
00:17:26.379,00:17:27.922,Gongmen City!
00:17:28.047,00:17:32.176,Gongmen is under the stewardship of the Masters' Council and we will protect it.
00:17:32.301,00:17:34.512,Even from you.
00:17:34.637,00:17:38.850,you feel that way.
00:17:38.975,00:17:42.186,"Otherwise, I'd have dragged that here for nothing."
00:17:42.311,00:17:44.355,"What's in the box, Shen?"
00:17:44.480,00:17:48.317,You want to see? It's a gift.
00:17:48.442,00:17:49.819,It's your parting gift.
00:17:49.944,00:17:51.696,In that it will part you.
00:17:51.821,00:17:57.785,"Part of you here, part of you there and part of you way over there, staining the wall!"
00:17:57.911,00:17:59.412,You insolent fool!
00:18:17.555,00:18:18.598,Show-off.
00:18:18.723,00:18:20.391,That is a warning.
00:18:20.516,00:18:23.603,You are no match for our kung fu.
00:18:23.728,00:18:25.563,I agree.
00:18:25.688,00:18:27.690,But this is.
00:18:41.245,00:18:43.915,Are you familiar with the Master of Gongmen City?
00:18:44.040,00:18:45.917,- Master Thundering Rhino?
00:18:46.042,00:18:48.419,- Son of Legendary Flying Rhino?
00:18:48.544,00:18:51.505,And Slayer of the Ten Thousand Serpents in the Valley of Woe?
00:18:51.631,00:18:53.716,- He's dead.
00:18:55.676,00:18:57.804,Rhino's Horn Defense is impervious to any technique.
00:18:57.929,00:19:01.474,It was no technique.
00:19:01.599,00:19:03.977,One that breathes fire and spits metal.
00:19:04.102,00:19:09.273,"Unless he is stopped, this could be the end of kung fu."
00:19:09.398,00:19:14.194,- But I just got kung fu!
00:19:14.320,00:19:18.407,Go! Destroy this weapon and bring Lord Shen to justice!
00:19:18.532,00:19:19.909,"OK, here we go!"
00:19:20.034,00:19:22.536,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:19:22.662,00:19:23.704,How can I do this?
00:19:23.830,00:19:27.000,"I mean, how can kung fu stop something that stops kung fu?"
00:19:27.125,00:19:32.755,"Remember, Dragon Warrior, anything is possible when you have inner peace."
00:19:38.552,00:19:40.721,Inner peace. Inner peace.
00:19:43.016,00:19:44.767,- Peace!
00:19:44.892,00:19:47.145,"Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack."
00:19:47.269,00:19:50.773,I packed you food for weeks.
00:19:50.898,00:19:53.860,I even packed all your action figures. See?
00:19:55.653,00:19:58.489,"Oh, uh... Hey, I don't know what those are."
00:19:58.614,00:20:00.366,Never seen them before in my life.
00:20:00.491,00:20:02.493,"Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress."
00:20:02.618,00:20:07.957,"I also packed your paintings of our best time together, just in case you get lonely."
00:20:08.082,00:20:09.917,That's me and you making noodles.
00:20:10.043,00:20:12.003,And that's me and you eating noodles.
00:20:12.128,00:20:15.631,And that's me giving you a piggyback ride.
00:20:15.756,00:20:19.468,Isn't that cute?
00:20:19.593,00:20:21.428,"Hey, uh..."
00:20:21.554,00:20:25.058,"Of course, of course."
00:20:25.183,00:20:34.274,"...far from home, in a strange city, filled with strange people, and strange noodles, facing horrible danger from which you might never return!"
00:20:34.400,00:20:35.651,"Don't go, Po."
00:20:35.776,00:20:38.196,I gotta go.
00:20:38.320,00:20:40.656,It's kind of my job to save kung fu.
00:20:40.781,00:20:43.743,And if I don't...
00:20:43.868,00:20:46.162,You're my son.
00:20:48.831,00:20:50.124,Right?
00:20:51.500,00:20:54.628,"- Um, goodbye."
00:20:56.589,00:20:58.298,"Don't worry, Mr. Ping."
00:20:58.424,00:21:00.885,He'll be back before you can say noodles.
00:21:06.390,00:21:08.559,Noodles.
00:21:14.774,00:21:16.525,"Come on, guys, let's go!"
00:21:16.650,00:21:18.194,Yeah!
00:21:22.448,00:21:24.117,"Yeah, yeah."
00:21:24.242,00:21:25.534,Yeah...
00:22:44.864,00:22:46.573,Mama?
00:22:51.662,00:22:53.247,Mom? Dad?
00:22:53.371,00:22:54.456,Is that you?
00:22:54.581,00:22:57.126,Mom! Dad!
00:22:58.460,00:23:01.172,"Oh, hi. Hey, son."
00:23:01.297,00:23:02.673,Huh?
00:23:02.798,00:23:04.675,"Honey, what are you doing here?"
00:23:04.800,00:23:06.177,But I thought...
00:23:06.302,00:23:09.138,"We've replaced you, dear, with this lovely radish."
00:23:10.097,00:23:11.182,Radish?
00:23:11.307,00:23:15.019,"It's quiet, polite, and frankly, does better kung fu."
00:23:15.144,00:23:17.771,"- No. No, no, no."
00:23:28.157,00:23:31.118,- Hi-yah!
00:23:38.542,00:23:41.045,"Radish, radish, radish."
00:23:56.269,00:23:57.644,P...
00:23:57.770,00:23:59.188,Inner peace.
00:24:01.523,00:24:02.983,Aaah!
00:24:15.246,00:24:20.542,Inner peace! Inner peace!
00:24:24.838,00:24:28.259,"Oh. Uh, I'm, uh, training."
00:24:28.384,00:24:31.220,The mast is not a worthy opponent.
00:24:34.640,00:24:37.143,- I am ready.
00:24:37.268,00:24:39.437,So serious.
00:24:44.317,00:24:46.360,Ha-ha-ow!
00:24:46.484,00:24:49.447,- I think I prefer the mast.
00:24:49.571,00:24:53.951,I used to punch the ironwood trees by the palace to train.
00:24:54.076,00:24:55.619,Now I feel nothing.
00:24:56.412,00:24:58.622,That's severely cool.
00:25:01.375,00:25:02.709,Again!
00:25:02.835,00:25:04.795,Hah!
00:25:04.920,00:25:09.549,"So, uh, this punching ironwood trees, how long did you have to do that?"
00:25:09.675,00:25:13.053,- Twenty years.
00:25:13.179,00:25:15.473,"Is there any, uh, you know, faster way?"
00:25:15.597,00:25:18.225,"You know, until you, uh, you know... don't feel anything?"
00:25:18.351,00:25:19.352,No.
00:25:19.477,00:25:21.812,- Besides...
00:25:24.440,00:25:27.651,I don't think hard style is your thing.
00:25:28.277,00:25:29.820,Oh.
00:25:31.947,00:25:34.783,"Po, why are you really out here?"
00:25:36.285,00:25:39.497,I just found out that my dad...
00:25:41.415,00:25:43.334,Your dad? The goose.
00:25:45.711,00:25:48.088,That must have been quite a shock.
00:25:48.214,00:25:50.174,Yeah.
00:25:50.299,00:25:53.093,- And this bothers you?
00:25:53.219,00:25:56.222,"We're warriors, right?"
00:25:56.347,00:25:58.349,Souls of platinum.
00:25:58.474,00:25:59.933,Like you.
00:26:00.059,00:26:01.852,So hardcore you don't feel anything.
00:26:03.354,00:26:06.273,Yo. Wow.
00:26:06.399,00:26:09.276,- I was...
00:26:09.402,00:26:11.070,Nothing. Nothing.
00:26:11.195,00:26:13.280,Po's having daddy issues.
00:26:13.406,00:26:16.783,I'm so lucky. I don't have any problems with my dad.
00:26:16.909,00:26:19.328,Maybe it's because Mom ate his head before I was born.
00:26:19.453,00:26:22.331,- I don't know.
00:26:22.456,00:26:24.542,Po is the one freaking out.
00:26:24.666,00:26:26.544,- I'm not freaking out.
00:26:26.668,00:26:29.171,- I'm freaking in.
00:26:29.296,00:26:32.091,- What?
00:26:32.216,00:26:34.385,Gongmen City.
00:26:52.986,00:27:01.161,"He used to let me play here beside him, promising someday that this throne would be mine."
00:27:05.791,00:27:07.126,A little to the left.
00:27:07.251,00:27:09.420,"Oh, but it's so heavy, master!"
00:27:09.545,00:27:12.548,Thirty years I've waited for this moment.
00:27:12.672,00:27:16.469,Everything must be exactly how I envisioned it.
00:27:16.594,00:27:19.930,And I envisioned it a little to the left.
00:27:20.055,00:27:22.391,- Perfect!
00:27:22.516,00:27:26.186,With the weapon by my si...
00:27:28.147,00:27:33.819,"With the weapon by my side, all of China will bow before me."
00:27:33.944,00:27:39.492,"We move out in three days, when the moon is full and the tide is high."
00:27:41.285,00:27:44.497,"Now, you old goat, why don't you tell me my..."
00:27:44.622,00:27:45.539,Fortune?
00:27:45.663,00:27:47.458,F... Future.
00:27:47.583,00:27:50.377,I was going to say future.
00:27:50.503,00:27:54.381,Look into your bowl and tell me what glory awaits.
00:27:55.882,00:28:05.976,If you continue on your ...you will find yourself...
00:28:07.102,00:28:08.479,Oh.
00:28:08.604,00:28:11.064,I see...
00:28:11.190,00:28:13.275,I see...
00:28:13.859,00:28:15.235,I see pain.
00:28:15.361,00:28:17.655,- Ow!
00:28:17.779,00:28:20.407,How dare you?
00:28:20.533,00:28:23.494,- Followed by denial.
00:28:23.619,00:28:26.913,- You're just saying what's happening...
00:28:27.039,00:28:32.294,- The most important time is now.
00:28:32.419,00:28:34.838,But if you really want to see the future...
00:28:37.424,00:28:39.385,"Oh, what do you see?"
00:28:48.060,00:28:52.523,...is defeated by a warrior of black and white.
00:28:53.566,00:28:55.693,Nothing has changed.
00:29:01.156,00:29:04.660,"That's impossible, and you know it."
00:29:04.784,00:29:07.787,"It is not impossible, and he knows it."
00:29:07.913,00:29:11.500,- Who?
00:29:11.625,00:29:14.294,- A panda?
00:29:14.420,00:29:17.256,A kung fu warrior.
00:29:17.381,00:29:19.007,Big and furry.
00:29:19.132,00:29:22.094,Soft and squishy. Ugh.
00:29:22.219,00:29:26.014,There are no more pandas.
00:29:26.139,00:29:29.560,"eyesight, he can see the truth."
00:29:29.685,00:29:32.563,Why is it that you cannot?
00:29:32.688,00:29:36.775,Find this panda and bring him to me!
00:29:36.900,00:29:38.360,"Yes, sir!"
00:29:38.485,00:29:42.656,One panda lives.
00:29:42.781,00:29:46.326,You're right.
00:29:46.452,00:29:50.914,Then I will kill him and make you wrong.
00:29:52.750,00:29:54.918,Will you stop that!
00:30:07.180,00:30:10.476,That must be Shen's palace on the other side of the city.
00:30:10.601,00:30:18.150,"Great. We'll march into the tower and proclaim, We are the Dragon Warrior and the Furious Five, and we are here to bring you to justice!"
00:30:20.694,00:30:21.987,What are you doing?
00:30:22.112,00:30:23.822,This place is crawling with wolves.
00:30:28.868,00:30:31.913,"Hey, isn't that the guy who hammered you in the face?"
00:30:33.832,00:30:35.083,Oh!
00:30:35.208,00:30:36.794,I do not like that guy.
00:30:36.918,00:30:40.422,We need to get to that tower without being spotted by those wolves.
00:30:40.547,00:30:43.425,Got it. Stealth mode.
00:30:54.520,00:30:56.605,- Ow!
00:31:10.327,00:31:12.496,Hmm. Where did those noodles go?
00:31:13.455,00:31:14.956,Ooh.
00:31:18.877,00:31:21.380,I couldn't help but...
00:31:21.505,00:31:24.424,"Yeah, OK."
00:31:24.550,00:31:28.136,- Where's Po?
00:31:30.180,00:31:32.974,Ooh. OK.
00:31:38.856,00:31:40.691,Guys! Guys?
00:31:40.816,00:31:42.651,"- Hey, Po."
00:31:42.776,00:31:44.277,"So that was stealth mode, huh?"
00:31:44.403,00:31:46.988,"To be honest, not one of my stronger modes."
00:31:47.113,00:31:49.032,"...gold in there, come on!"
00:31:52.035,00:31:54.329,You stole all my metal pots for Lord Shen!
00:31:54.454,00:31:58.751,"- Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!"
00:31:58.876,00:32:00.836,"Po, do something."
00:32:00.960,00:32:03.714,How am I supposed to help her cook rice without getting caught?
00:32:03.839,00:32:05.924,"- Wait, I have a better idea."
00:32:06.049,00:32:07.092,One.
00:32:07.217,00:32:09.344,- Hey.
00:32:14.266,00:32:16.309,- Aaargh!
00:32:16.435,00:32:18.937,Ooh. Ah.
00:32:19.062,00:32:20.647,Yuck!
00:32:20.773,00:32:22.691,We're here to liberate the city and bring Shen to justice.
00:32:22.816,00:32:25.068,- You will need help.
00:32:22.816,00:32:26.445,"- Thank you, brave sheep, but it's too dangerous."
00:32:26.570,00:32:28.238,"Oh, no, not me."
00:32:28.363,00:32:29.740,It's not safe to speak here.
00:32:29.865,00:32:31.116,Right.
00:32:31.241,00:32:32.117,Ooh.
00:32:33.702,00:32:36.162,I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.
00:32:36.288,00:32:39.207,They're in Gongmen Jail on Black Dragon Alley.
00:32:39.332,00:32:41.251,What? They're still alive?
00:32:41.376,00:32:46.381,"They must be in that jail gathering intelligence, hatching a plot to use their awesomeness to defeat the weapon!"
00:32:46.506,00:32:50.009,"OK, let's go!"
00:32:50.135,00:32:51.637,Hey! Stop that costume!
00:32:51.762,00:32:53.597,- Hold it right there!
00:32:53.722,00:32:56.266,- Get them!
00:32:56.391,00:32:57.851,Take... that!
00:32:57.976,00:32:59.853,- Keep going!
00:33:00.437,00:33:01.939,Hey!
00:33:12.240,00:33:13.992,Ha-ha.
00:33:24.127,00:33:25.337,Surround him.
00:33:29.299,00:33:30.801,Gotcha!
00:33:30.926,00:33:31.969,Huh?
00:33:32.093,00:33:33.178,Huh? Where'd he go?
00:33:33.303,00:33:35.430,Spread out!
00:33:35.555,00:33:38.558,a part of everywhere?
00:33:38.684,00:33:42.479,- I... I guess.
00:33:46.984,00:33:50.529,They must be close.
00:33:50.654,00:33:52.823,"Sorry, Po. It's just me."
00:33:53.699,00:33:55.993,Look. Gongmen Jail.
00:33:59.371,00:34:01.373,"Aw, it's cute."
00:34:07.086,00:34:09.631,- Yah!
00:34:12.300,00:34:16.054,- Ohh!
00:34:16.179,00:34:18.473,"At the first sign of trouble, I'll give you a signal."
00:34:18.598,00:34:19.808,"Ga-gah, gi-gee!"
00:34:19.933,00:34:21.977,- You mean like Crane does?
00:34:22.101,00:34:24.396,"Excuse me, when have I ever made that noise?"
00:34:24.521,00:34:28.859,Master Ox! Master!
00:34:28.984,00:34:33.238,The ferocious Master Croc!
00:34:33.363,00:34:36.575,And Master Storming Ox.
00:34:36.700,00:34:39.536,I can't believe we're rescuing actual legends of kung fu.
00:34:39.661,00:34:41.663,We're gonna free you from those bonds of injustice. No problem.
00:34:41.788,00:34:44.207,Gotta be a key around here.
00:34:44.332,00:34:45.751,Yah!
00:34:45.876,00:34:48.503,"Oh, good! You found it."
00:34:48.628,00:34:52.340,"We're coming for you, Shen!"
00:34:52.465,00:34:54.593,Wah-hah-hoo-hoo!
00:34:54.718,00:34:56.261,Whoo...
00:34:56.386,00:34:58.055,"Guys, are we going or not?"
00:34:58.179,00:34:59.514,Do you want to meet us there later?
00:34:59.639,00:35:01.600,"You do want to take back your city, right?"
00:35:01.725,00:35:03.435,Of course we do.
00:35:03.560,00:35:07.397,"But if we stand up to Shen, he will turn the weapon on the city."
00:35:07.522,00:35:10.859,Listen to yourself.
00:35:10.984,00:35:16.073,- If we all fight together...
00:35:16.197,00:35:19.659,"Oh, would it?"
00:35:19.785,00:35:22.996,- We get inside and then...
00:35:26.291,00:35:27.584,...by the unstoppable weapon.
00:35:27.709,00:35:32.923,Nothing's unstoppable except for me when I'm stopping you from telling me something's unstoppable!
00:35:42.975,00:35:46.019,"Master Ox, I'm not letting you stay in this cell."
00:35:46.144,00:35:47.896,I'd like to see you get me out!
00:35:48.021,00:35:49.230,Hah!
00:35:53.234,00:35:55.737,You guys see that?
00:35:55.862,00:35:57.697,Come on! Whatever happened to being heroes?
00:35:57.823,00:36:00.826,The only hero in this town is a dead one!
00:36:00.951,00:36:02.452,Aaargh!
00:36:05.413,00:36:08.792,"Like I said, you are not getting me out of this cell!"
00:36:11.711,00:36:13.755,Yes! Ha-ha! Whoo!
00:36:13.880,00:36:16.633,"All right, let's go!"
00:36:16.758,00:36:18.135,I get the top bunk.
00:36:20.095,00:36:21.847,"It's time to surrender, panda."
00:36:21.972,00:36:24.223,Kung fu is dead.
00:36:24.349,00:36:26.643,I... Ooh...
00:36:30.313,00:36:33.358,Kung fu is dead? Fine!
00:36:33.483,00:36:37.154,You stay in your prison of fear with bars made of hopelessness.
00:36:37.278,00:36:40.406,And all you get are three square meals a day of shame!
00:36:40.532,00:36:42.200,With despair for dessert.
00:36:42.325,00:36:49.749,We'll take on Shen and prove to all those who are hungry for justice and honor that kung fu still lives!
00:36:49.875,00:36:51.459,Yeah!
00:36:54.462,00:36:55.672,Monkey!
00:36:56.131,00:36:56.882,Ka-kaaa!
00:36:57.007,00:36:58.341,You! You're mine!
00:36:58.466,00:37:00.426,I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!
00:37:00.552,00:37:03.471,"My fist in your plush, cuddly, super-soft face!"
00:37:04.639,00:37:06.141,Uh-oh.
00:37:06.265,00:37:07.976,Get him!
00:37:08.101,00:37:10.645,- Get me out of here!
00:37:15.108,00:37:16.609,Faster!
00:37:20.446,00:37:21.656,"Go, go!"
00:37:21.781,00:37:24.868,- Lose him!
00:37:26.327,00:37:28.454,- Viper!
00:37:28.580,00:37:30.082,Oooh-waaah!
00:37:30.207,00:37:32.584,Whoo-hah!
00:37:37.547,00:37:38.631,What?
00:37:38.757,00:37:40.717,Watch out!
00:37:40.842,00:37:43.344,Whoa! Waargh!
00:37:43.469,00:37:45.388,"Uncool, very uncool!"
00:37:48.850,00:37:51.144,"Guys, guys, guys!"
00:37:53.730,00:37:55.232,Ha-ha-ha!
00:37:55.356,00:37:56.858,Maybe something smaller!
00:37:56.983,00:37:59.485,"No, no! Oh, no, no."
00:38:01.446,00:38:03.615,"Ha, ha-ha, ha-ha, ha!"
00:38:03.740,00:38:07.035,Cute bunnies off the face!
00:38:09.996,00:38:12.249,Aaaargh!
00:38:18.255,00:38:19.631,We've lost them.
00:38:19.756,00:38:22.675,Ah!
00:38:30.642,00:38:32.351,Hah!
00:38:32.477,00:38:34.604,"Crane, catch!"
00:38:35.730,00:38:36.773,Wheee!
00:38:36.898,00:38:38.775,- Gotcha!
00:38:38.900,00:38:41.945,Whoa! Ow!
00:38:46.407,00:38:47.700,Ha-ha!
00:38:47.826,00:38:50.162,"Guys, guys, guys, give me a shove!"
00:38:50.287,00:38:52.455,"Mantis, now!"
00:39:05.593,00:39:07.386,Is that all you've got?
00:39:05.593,00:39:09.555,"'Cause it feels like I'm fighting a big, old, fluffy cloud!"
00:39:09.681,00:39:11.724,"Well, this cloud is about to bring the thunder!"
00:39:11.850,00:39:15.353,- Ooh! Ow! Ow!
00:39:15.478,00:39:17.355,- Your turn!
00:39:17.480,00:39:18.940,Ha-ha-ha!
00:39:19.065,00:39:21.526,- Why are there...
00:39:28.449,00:39:31.494,"Ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow!"
00:39:37.667,00:39:40.295,Come here!
00:39:41.420,00:39:44.841,Yes! Taste the defeat!
00:39:44.966,00:39:46.718,Let me tell you something.
00:39:46.843,00:39:49.221,"Next time you mess with a panda, you better bring a whole..."
00:39:59.189,00:40:03.943,"I guess nobody told you, if you mess with the wolf, you get the fangs."
00:40:04.069,00:40:06.112,- Ooh!
00:40:06.238,00:40:08.781,What are you going to do now?
00:40:11.450,00:40:13.203,We surrender!
00:40:13.328,00:40:14.620,Ha!
00:40:16.915,00:40:20.001,"You can chain my body, but you'll never chain my..."
00:40:20.126,00:40:21.294,...warrior spirit.
00:40:21.419,00:40:22.545,"Hey, don't forget the little guy."
00:40:22.670,00:40:23.880,Did you just call...?
00:40:24.005,00:40:25.798,"Po, what are you doing?"
00:40:25.924,00:40:28.301,Trust me. I got a pl...
00:40:28.426,00:40:31.470,No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?
00:40:31.596,00:40:33.306,Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
00:40:33.431,00:40:38.228,"The more you move, These are the best cuffs!"
00:40:40.188,00:40:43.400,"Greetings, panda."
00:40:44.317,00:40:46.611,"No, no."
00:40:49.697,00:40:53.201,We meet at last!
00:40:53.326,00:40:55.203,"Greetings, panda."
00:40:57.789,00:41:01.542,- You are afraid for a reason.
00:41:01.667,00:41:04.045,He is coming to me in chains.
00:41:04.170,00:41:07.424,"- If anyone should be afraid, it's..."
00:41:10.385,00:41:13.179,Don't even think about it.
00:41:26.067,00:41:31.489,"I hope this turns out better than your plan to cook rice in your stomach, by eating it raw and then drinking boiling water."
00:41:31.614,00:41:33.491,This plan is nothing like that plan.
00:41:33.616,00:41:36.077,- How?
00:41:48.465,00:41:50.633,Keep moving.
00:41:56.055,00:41:58.891,"Ah, my old enemy."
00:42:03.480,00:42:05.190,Stairs.
00:42:33.510,00:42:36.846,Thanks for carrying me those last few flights. OK.
00:42:36.971,00:42:39.224,I threw up a little bit on the third floor.
00:42:39.349,00:42:41.059,Someone might want to clean that up.
00:42:41.184,00:42:43.728,Is there some sort of evil janitor or something?
00:42:43.853,00:42:45.522,"Greetings, panda."
00:42:45.646,00:42:48.274,- We meet at...
00:42:49.692,00:42:51.027,Hey.
00:42:51.152,00:42:54.280,You've grown up bigger than I thought.
00:42:54.406,00:42:57.158,Hey. Enough with the poking around.
00:42:57.283,00:43:00.203,"Strong, hmm? Healthy."
00:43:00.328,00:43:02.788,"Look, I don't know who you are, but please stand aside, sir."
00:43:02.914,00:43:05.666,- Oh! Sorry.
00:43:05.791,00:43:08.211,The beard threw me.
00:43:08.336,00:43:11.672,- False advertising.
00:43:11.797,00:43:13.632,Bring the prisoners to me.
00:43:13.758,00:43:15.343,"Sorry, ma'am."
00:43:15.468,00:43:18.304,Keep your eyes peeled for the... weapon!
00:43:19.055,00:43:21.224,Yeargh! Hah! Yah!
00:43:22.683,00:43:24.810,Sparrow kick! Wyy-yah!
00:43:24.936,00:43:26.854,We did it!
00:43:26.979,00:43:28.856,Did you guys see that?
00:43:28.981,00:43:31.317,Waaargh...!
00:43:32.360,00:43:33.736,Oh!
00:43:37.949,00:43:41.077,Do you actually believe this is the warrior destined to defeat me?
00:43:41.202,00:43:44.497,I do not.
00:43:47.125,00:43:51.087,A lifetime to plot his revenge and he comes to me on his knees.
00:43:51.212,00:43:53.214,What? A lifetime?
00:43:53.339,00:43:54.673,I did not have a lifetime.
00:43:54.799,00:43:58.136,"We only heard about Master Rhino a few days ago, and we came to avenge him!"
00:43:58.261,00:44:01.598,You've come to avenge nothing else?
00:44:01.722,00:44:04.016,"Well, yeah. All the pots and pans that you stole."
00:44:04.142,00:44:06.436,- I'm gonna want those back.
00:44:06.561,00:44:09.772,"You probably did some other evil stuff along the way, I don't know."
00:44:09.897,00:44:11.524,- What else did you do?
00:44:11.690,00:44:13.234,- Know what?
00:44:13.359,00:44:14.611,What's so funny?
00:44:14.735,00:44:17.614,The very thing that you clearly do not know!
00:44:17.738,00:44:21.700,"OK, enough of these riddles!"
00:44:21.826,00:44:25.204,"First we come in and the weapon is tiny. Surprise, it's big."
00:44:25.330,00:44:27.748,"Then the lady over here, I think it's a guy."
00:44:27.873,00:44:29.292,'Cause he's got... Whoa!
00:44:29.417,00:44:37.216,The only reason you are still alive is that I find your stupidity mildly amusing.
00:44:37.342,00:44:40.761,"Well, thank you. But I find your evilness extremely annoying."
00:44:40.886,00:44:42.805,"Who do you think you are, panda?"
00:44:42.930,00:44:45.433,"Who do you think I am, peacock?"
00:44:54.317,00:44:57.153,Why are we laughing?
00:44:57.278,00:44:58.779,Take aim.
00:45:14.711,00:45:15.672,Huh?
00:45:15.796,00:45:18.591,"Well, light the thing!"
00:45:18.715,00:45:20.926,I did!
00:45:25.056,00:45:27.266,Fear the bug!
00:45:30.228,00:45:31.437,Ha-ha!
00:45:39.529,00:45:41.698,Tigress!
00:46:14.146,00:46:15.690,You... you were there.
00:46:15.814,00:46:18.901,"Yes. Yes, I was."
00:46:26.743,00:46:27.993,You just let Shen get away!
00:46:28.119,00:46:29.912,At least we destroyed the weapon.
00:46:34.208,00:46:36.419,Fire!
00:46:38.588,00:46:40.757,"Oh, no, he's got way more."
00:46:42.883,00:46:44.176,"Aargh, aargh!"
00:46:46.638,00:46:48.805,- My wing!
00:46:48.931,00:46:50.349,Coming! Aaargh!
00:46:50.475,00:46:52.602,- Watch out!
00:46:54.228,00:46:56.063,Whoa. Wow!
00:46:56.188,00:46:59.358,- Help me up!
00:46:59.484,00:47:01.235,Use the ropes.
00:47:03.946,00:47:06.115,Waaargh!
00:47:09.952,00:47:12.204,"Run, run, little panda!"
00:47:23.257,00:47:25.217,"Po, come on."
00:47:25.343,00:47:28.304,"- I got it, I got it!"
00:47:31.599,00:47:33.810,- We're trapped!
00:47:40.692,00:47:42.067,Yah!
00:47:42.777,00:47:44.320,Fire!
00:47:45.488,00:47:47.824,Get back!
00:47:47.948,00:47:50.159,Hah! Hah!
00:47:54.747,00:47:57.709,- The only way out is up.
00:48:05.924,00:48:08.093,Yee-hah!
00:48:09.136,00:48:10.221,Whoo-hoo!
00:48:10.346,00:48:13.599,Follow me! Come on!
00:48:13.725,00:48:15.601,- Where are they going?
00:48:15.727,00:48:18.103,Come on! Keep going!
00:48:24.861,00:48:26.612,Here we go!
00:48:30.032,00:48:32.368,Whoa-aahh!
00:48:44.963,00:48:46.465,You idiot!
00:48:46.591,00:48:48.467,Ow! My nose!
00:48:48.593,00:48:52.680,Call in the wolves! All of them.
00:48:52.805,00:48:56.768,The Year of the Peacock begins now!
00:48:56.893,00:48:58.185,Right now?
00:48:58.310,00:49:04.191,"'Cause it's the middle of the year, so you'd only get, like, a half of the Year of the Peacock."
00:49:04.316,00:49:08.195,"And this is the Year, of course, of the Peacock."
00:49:08.320,00:49:09.988,"Happy New Year, sir."
00:49:13.492,00:49:17.830,Get the wolves ready.
00:49:17.954,00:49:19.081,Now!
00:49:19.206,00:49:21.250,"Now, now, now, now!"
00:49:21.375,00:49:24.378,"Move! Move, move, move, move!"
00:49:46.358,00:49:48.611,- Let's go.
00:49:53.407,00:49:57.161,"Oh, you! What did you do?"
00:49:57.286,00:49:59.121,What happened to stopping Shen?
00:50:00.372,00:50:03.334,Yeah.
00:50:03.459,00:50:05.377,"Guys, come on."
00:50:05.503,00:50:08.380,"I meant for him to get away because, uh..."
00:50:08.506,00:50:10.967,...it was a trick.
00:50:11.091,00:50:16.848,I was thinking...
00:50:16.973,00:50:18.516,That makes no sense.
00:50:18.641,00:50:21.894,- What do you mean?
00:50:22.018,00:50:24.647,- You had Shen. What happened?
00:50:24.772,00:50:27.650,I don't know what you're talking about. I... Yeah...
00:50:27.775,00:50:29.318,"OK, he caught me off guard."
00:50:29.986,00:50:32.154,The truth.
00:50:34.365,00:50:37.910,Fine. They will keep you far from danger.
00:50:38.034,00:50:40.913,- Real far.
00:50:41.037,00:50:43.039,You're staying here.
00:50:43.165,00:50:45.167,W... Wait!
00:50:45.292,00:50:47.294,I have to go ba...
00:50:51.465,00:50:53.009,You're staying here!
00:50:53.133,00:50:56.178,I'm going.
00:50:56.721,00:50:59.181,Whoa!
00:50:59.306,00:51:01.600,OK. I wasn't ready that time.
00:51:01.726,00:51:03.435,Guys? Don't.
00:51:03.561,00:51:05.145,Ready.
00:51:05.270,00:51:06.522,Look!
00:51:12.695,00:51:15.155,- Aaaah!
00:51:18.910,00:51:20.452,Stay down.
00:51:21.871,00:51:24.665,- I have to get to him.
00:51:27.209,00:51:29.628,He was there! OK?
00:51:29.754,00:51:33.089,The peacock was there the last time I saw my parents.
00:51:33.215,00:51:36.761,He knows what happened.
00:51:36.886,00:51:39.680,Who I am.
00:51:43.183,00:51:45.811,"Look, I'm going."
00:51:45.937,00:51:48.230,I have to know.
00:51:48.355,00:51:51.483,- The hardcore can't understand.
00:51:56.447,00:51:58.657,The hardcore do understand.
00:52:00.158,00:52:03.662,But I can't watch my friend be killed.
00:52:03.788,00:52:08.084,- We're going.
00:52:08.208,00:52:11.587,- Stop being a wimp.
00:52:12.797,00:52:15.257,- No.
00:52:15.382,00:52:17.384,You're better off here.
00:52:26.644,00:52:28.813,Soothsayer.
00:52:28.938,00:52:31.607,We sail to victory tonight.
00:52:31.732,00:52:34.192,Your magic panda is clearly a fool.
00:52:34.318,00:52:37.321,Are you certain it is the panda who is a fool?
00:52:37.446,00:52:40.116,"You just destroyed your ancestral home, Shen."
00:52:40.240,00:52:45.621,A trivial sacrifice when all of China is my reward.
00:52:45.746,00:52:48.248,Then will you finally be satisfied?
00:52:48.373,00:52:52.544,Will the subjugation of the whole world finally make you feel better?
00:52:52.670,00:52:54.170,"Mmm, it's a start."
00:52:54.296,00:52:57.341,I might also convert the basement into a dungeon.
00:52:59.718,00:53:02.554,The cup you choose to fill has no bottom.
00:53:02.680,00:53:06.892,It is time to stop this madness.
00:53:07.018,00:53:08.602,Why on earth would I do that?
00:53:08.727,00:53:11.897,So your parents can rest in peace.
00:53:12.023,00:53:15.275,My parents hated me.
00:53:16.152,00:53:18.112,Do you understand?
00:53:19.363,00:53:21.448,They wronged me.
00:53:21.573,00:53:24.785,And... I will make it right.
00:53:24.910,00:53:26.162,They loved you.
00:53:26.286,00:53:31.291,They loved you so much that having to send you away killed them.
00:53:33.669,00:53:37.173,The dead exist in the past...
00:53:37.297,00:53:39.675,...and I must tend to the future.
00:53:44.304,00:53:48.308,Set the Soothsayer free.
00:53:48.433,00:53:50.061,"Goodbye, Shen."
00:53:50.186,00:53:52.063,I wish you happiness.
00:53:52.188,00:53:55.231,Happiness must be taken...
00:53:56.734,00:53:59.195,...and I will take mine.
00:54:12.833,00:54:14.043,Huh?
00:54:24.803,00:54:28.182,"If all of those weapons leave the building, China will fall."
00:54:28.306,00:54:30.893,- We bring down the building!
00:54:31.018,00:54:32.603,How about this?
00:54:33.812,00:54:35.898,Oh! This will work!
00:54:36.023,00:54:39.068,"- All right, let's go."
00:54:46.324,00:54:47.283,Aargh!
00:54:54.250,00:54:56.543,call it Year of the Peacock?
00:54:56.668,00:54:58.629,- Hey.
00:54:58.754,00:54:59.880,Hey.
00:55:00.005,00:55:01.423,OK. Keep it cool.
00:55:01.548,00:55:04.218,Where are you going?
00:55:06.137,00:55:07.429,On your feet!
00:55:07.554,00:55:09.765,And wipe those stupid grins off your faces.
00:55:24.320,00:55:26.949,"Faster, faster."
00:55:36.959,00:55:39.295,"Greetings, panda."
00:55:42.631,00:55:44.133,Tell me what happened that night.
00:55:44.258,00:55:45.550,What night?
00:55:45.676,00:55:48.637,- That night.
00:55:48.762,00:55:51.890,"Yes. We're talking about the same night, right?"
00:55:52.016,00:55:54.350,"Yes, I was there."
00:55:54.476,00:55:56.770,Yes. I watched as your parents abandoned you.
00:55:56.895,00:55:58.230,It's a terrible thing.
00:55:58.354,00:56:00.941,I believe it went something like this.
00:56:01.900,00:56:03.110,Waah!
00:56:04.444,00:56:07.031,Aaaah!
00:56:11.660,00:56:13.078,Here's your New Year's gift.
00:56:13.204,00:56:15.331,Hope you like it 'cause you can't return it.
00:56:17.166,00:56:20.502,Po? What's he doing here?
00:56:20.627,00:56:22.046,Return it! Return it!
00:56:26.842,00:56:28.802,Yah! Hah!
00:56:33.974,00:56:36.518,to die to find the truth?
00:56:36.643,00:56:37.936,You bet I am.
00:56:38.062,00:56:40.105,Although I'd prefer not to.
00:56:40.231,00:56:41.732,Yow!
00:56:43.859,00:56:45.861,Waargh!
00:57:04.462,00:57:06.006,Wah!
00:57:06.131,00:57:07.174,Yah!
00:57:12.221,00:57:14.014,Whoa! Oh!
00:57:33.367,00:57:34.701,Um...
00:57:34.826,00:57:36.453,"I said that too soon, didn't I?"
00:57:36.578,00:57:39.248,Kee-ya! Ahhh!
00:57:45.045,00:57:46.380,Po!
00:57:51.051,00:57:52.386,"Po, get away from him."
00:57:52.510,00:57:54.930,I'll get up.
00:57:57.557,00:57:58.558,"No more running, Shen."
00:57:58.683,00:58:00.311,So it seems.
00:58:00.436,00:58:02.438,Now... answers.
00:58:02.562,00:58:04.189,"Oh, you want to know so badly."
00:58:05.774,00:58:09.153,"You think knowing will heal you, huh?"
00:58:09.278,00:58:13.324,Fill some crater in your soul?
00:58:13.449,00:58:15.700,"Well, here's your answer."
00:58:15.826,00:58:19.121,Your parents didn't love you.
00:58:19.830,00:58:24.668,"But here, let me heal you!"
00:58:30.590,00:58:32.301,- Ah!
00:58:38.807,00:58:40.100,Oh!
00:59:47.042,00:59:49.378,"Yeah, like you could make me drink that."
00:59:49.503,00:59:51.505,Aaahh! Aaah...
00:59:53.673,00:59:57.969,"If I wanted you dead, I would have left you in that river."
00:59:58.095,00:59:59.304,"Well, why save me?"
00:59:59.430,01:00:02.224,So you can fulfill your destiny.
01:00:02.349,01:00:05.769,What are you talking about?
01:00:09.981,01:00:13.360,I'm surprised you remember so little.
01:00:13.485,01:00:16.863,But you were so little when it happened.
01:00:16.988,01:00:19.866,- Aah!
01:00:22.536,01:00:24.704,Perhaps you do remember.
01:00:24.829,01:00:27.165,What? It's just a stupid nightmare.
01:00:27.291,01:00:29.626,Nightmare or memory?
01:01:00.324,01:01:02.993,This was a thriving village.
01:01:03.118,01:01:06.704,Young Shen was in line to rule Gongmen City.
01:01:06.830,01:01:08.790,But he wanted more.
01:01:08.915,01:01:13.211,I foretold that someone would stand in his way.
01:01:13.337,01:01:14.796,A panda.
01:01:14.921,01:01:18.758,But I never could have foretold what came next.
01:01:31.980,01:01:33.607,Get them all!
01:01:40.071,01:01:42.282,Take our son and run away.
01:01:42.407,01:01:43.659,Go!
01:01:57.005,01:01:59.049,Stop fighting.
01:01:59.174,01:02:00.842,Let it flow.
01:03:08.034,01:03:10.746,Shh. Shh!
01:03:13.373,01:03:15.083,Mmm-ma.
01:04:04.549,01:04:11.973,Your story may not have such a happy beginning but that doesn't make you who you are.
01:04:12.098,01:04:15.477,It is the rest of your story.
01:04:15.602,01:04:17.854,Who you choose to be.
01:04:49.845,01:04:53.390,"So, who are you, panda?"
01:05:01.481,01:05:03.066,I am Po.
01:05:04.568,01:05:06.820,And I'm gonna need a hat.
01:05:16.079,01:05:18.582,"Such sad, sad faces."
01:05:18.707,01:05:21.918,But now is a time only for joy.
01:05:22.043,01:05:26.130,You are going to be part of something beautiful.
01:05:28.383,01:05:36.767,"Once we reach the harbor, in front of all the world, you and your precious kung fu will die."
01:05:38.852,01:05:43.899,Then China will know to bow before me.
01:05:44.023,01:05:44.982,Set sail!
01:05:45.108,01:05:46.568,- Aargh!
01:05:56.745,01:05:58.538,What is that?
01:06:18.224,01:06:21.728,"Honestly, guys, I never thought I'd die like this."
01:06:21.853,01:06:26.733,I always thought I'd meet a nice girl and settle down and then she'd eat my head.
01:06:26.858,01:06:29.319,- So sad.
01:06:29.444,01:06:31.321,Po would want us to remain strong.
01:06:31.446,01:06:34.532,Hardcore.
01:06:42.290,01:06:43.875,"Lord Shen, what about the bridge?"
01:06:44.000,01:06:46.878,Nothing stands in my way.
01:06:57.472,01:06:59.474,You coward!
01:07:08.817,01:07:10.109,Po?
01:07:14.906,01:07:16.032,Huh?
01:07:16.157,01:07:21.162,How many times do I have to kill the same stinking panda?
01:07:30.547,01:07:32.007,Shen!
01:07:32.131,01:07:34.718,A panda stands between you and your...
01:07:37.012,01:07:38.013,What?
01:07:38.137,01:07:39.639,Prepare yourself for a hot...
01:07:42.058,01:07:43.643,Your reign of terror comes to an end.
01:07:43.768,01:07:47.313,- What?
01:07:47.438,01:07:49.816,Disc of Destruction!
01:08:00.618,01:08:01.912,OK.
01:08:02.037,01:08:03.830,Take aim!
01:08:14.925,01:08:17.552,- Ready?
01:08:19.095,01:08:21.097,Ohh! Aargh! Ow!
01:08:25.226,01:08:27.062,"Oh, ho, ho, ho!"
01:08:31.775,01:08:34.569,This way and that way.
01:08:37.321,01:08:38.907,You can't follow me.
01:08:39.657,01:08:41.492,Just get him!
01:08:44.704,01:08:45.914,Oh!
01:08:46.039,01:08:47.958,"- Yeah, huh. Here we go."
01:08:51.544,01:08:52.921,Ya-ha!
01:08:54.672,01:08:56.466,"- No, no, no, don't shoot!"
01:08:56.591,01:08:57.968,"No, don't shoot!"
01:08:58.093,01:09:00.678,- Don't shoot.
01:09:00.804,01:09:02.513,I won't shoot if you won't shoot.
01:09:02.639,01:09:03.932,Don't shoot!
01:09:04.724,01:09:06.183,Woo-woo! Hah!
01:09:06.309,01:09:08.144,Don't shoot! Crossfire!
01:09:08.269,01:09:09.437,Attack!
01:09:11.481,01:09:13.274,Hi-yah! Yah!
01:09:15.276,01:09:16.653,Catch of Freedom!
01:09:16.778,01:09:18.071,Monkey!
01:09:23.242,01:09:25.495,"Impressive, Dragon Warrior."
01:09:25.620,01:09:26.830,Step one: Free the Five.
01:09:26.955,01:09:28.247,What's step two?
01:09:28.372,01:09:30.000,"Honestly, I didn't think I'd make it this far."
01:09:30.125,01:09:33.419,- Po!
01:09:38.091,01:09:39.968,Woo-hoo! Nice.
01:09:42.428,01:09:43.888,"Viper, Puppet of Death!"
01:09:44.472,01:09:45.640,Tigress!
01:09:51.813,01:09:52.689,Huh!
01:09:55.316,01:09:57.401,- Cham-pah!
01:09:57.527,01:09:58.736,Vengeance is served.
01:09:58.862,01:10:00.446,- Why did you...?
01:09:58.862,01:10:01.990,- Your friend there is very persuasive.
01:10:05.827,01:10:07.037,Hi-yah!
01:10:07.162,01:10:09.330,Yoo-ha! Wah!
01:10:09.455,01:10:10.832,Master Shifu!
01:10:12.959,01:10:15.503,Quickly. Use their boats to block the way.
01:10:23.594,01:10:26.014,Aah! Aah! Aah!
01:10:26.139,01:10:27.348,Crane!
01:10:28.391,01:10:31.394,Wings of Justice!
01:10:31.519,01:10:33.521,Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!
01:10:34.355,01:10:35.690,Yee-haw!
01:10:39.485,01:10:40.695,What?
01:11:03.551,01:11:05.220,Why aren't we firing?
01:11:05.344,01:11:09.682,"They're taking out our gunners, sir. They're getting close."
01:11:09.807,01:11:13.436,Fire! Fire!
01:11:13.561,01:11:15.563,"But, sir, we'll kill our own."
01:11:15.688,01:11:17.815,"I said, fire at them!"
01:11:17.941,01:11:19.192,Fire!
01:11:21.569,01:11:22.862,No.
01:11:30.120,01:11:31.412,Po!
01:12:07.198,01:12:08.532,Tigress?
01:12:58.041,01:12:59.750,As you wish.
01:12:59.876,01:13:02.295,Let's finish this.
01:13:25.318,01:13:26.652,Fire!
01:13:31.157,01:13:35.328,Inner peace. Inner peace.
01:13:52.720,01:13:54.347,Aaieee!
01:13:54.471,01:13:55.932,"Ho, ho, ho!"
01:13:56.057,01:13:57.392,"Cha, cha, cha!"
01:14:00.895,01:14:02.105,Again!
01:14:04.190,01:14:06.025,"Whoa, whoa!"
01:14:10.654,01:14:14.742,Kill him! Somebody kill him!
01:14:16.244,01:14:19.372,Aah... oh!
01:14:19.496,01:14:20.581,"Ha, ha!"
01:14:30.674,01:14:31.968,Yai!
01:14:35.388,01:14:37.473,- What?
01:14:45.648,01:14:47.108,Keep firing!
01:14:47.233,01:14:48.943,Keep firing!
01:14:56.742,01:14:58.786,Aaahh!
01:15:09.088,01:15:10.423,Skadoosh!
01:15:41.162,01:15:42.663,How did you...?
01:15:43.747,01:15:45.708,How did you do it?
01:15:49.212,01:15:52.048,"You know, you just keep your elbows up and keep the shoulders loose."
01:15:53.549,01:15:55.218,How did you find peace?
01:15:55.343,01:15:57.594,I took away your parents.
01:15:57.720,01:15:59.222,Everything.
01:15:59.347,01:16:01.598,I scarred you for life.
01:16:01.724,01:16:04.268,"See, that's the thing, Shen."
01:16:04.394,01:16:05.895,Scars heal.
01:16:06.020,01:16:08.105,"No, they don't."
01:16:08.231,01:16:09.690,Wounds heal.
01:16:09.815,01:16:11.692,"Oh, yeah."
01:16:11.817,01:16:15.238,"- They fade, I guess."
01:16:15.363,01:16:16.947,"You should, Shen."
01:16:17.073,01:16:21.285,You gotta let go of that stuff from the past 'cause it just doesn't matter.
01:16:21.411,01:16:25.831,The only thing that matters is what you choose to be now.
01:16:25.956,01:16:27.458,You're right.
01:16:27.583,01:16:30.253,Then I choose... this!
01:16:35.966,01:16:37.176,Aargh!
01:16:57.029,01:16:58.239,Whoa!
01:16:59.156,01:17:01.367,Ohh! Aargh!
01:17:22.721,01:17:25.266,That was pretty hardcore.
01:17:34.191,01:17:38.529,"- Po, come here! Yeah!"
01:17:38.654,01:17:42.658,It seems you have found inner peace.
01:17:42.783,01:17:45.119,And at such a young age.
01:17:45.244,01:17:47.037,"Well, I had a pretty good teacher."
01:17:47.163,01:17:48.498,Oh!
01:18:08.100,01:18:09.685,he's not here?
01:18:09.810,01:18:11.562,It's my son's birthday.
01:18:11.687,01:18:14.273,All he wanted was to meet the Dragon Warrior.
01:18:14.398,01:18:16.733,"How about some tofu birthday cake instead, huh?"
01:18:16.859,01:18:20.279,"You know, I think we'll just try again another time."
01:18:20.404,01:18:21.989,When do you think he'll be back?
01:18:24.617,01:18:25.701,I don't know.
01:18:25.826,01:18:27.578,"OK, I don't know."
01:18:27.703,01:18:28.829,Maybe never.
01:18:28.954,01:18:30.247,"I mean, I worry, OK?"
01:18:30.373,01:18:32.333,But that's my job.
01:18:32.458,01:18:34.335,"At least, I was his dad."
01:18:34.460,01:18:37.004,Why did he have to go and save China?
01:18:37.129,01:18:38.506,I know why.
01:18:38.631,01:18:40.007,But why?
01:18:40.132,01:18:42.510,He's just one little panda.
01:18:51.977,01:18:53.521,Aaah!
01:18:57.858,01:19:00.069,"So, how did it go?"
01:19:00.194,01:19:01.737,Did you save China?
01:19:02.572,01:19:04.073,Yep.
01:19:04.198,01:19:06.492,"Well, I knew you would."
01:19:06.617,01:19:08.411,That's why I had new signs made.
01:19:08.536,01:19:10.829,My son saved China.
01:19:10.954,01:19:13.541,"Buy one dumpling, get one free."
01:19:13.666,01:19:15.125,"Hey, that's a pretty good deal."
01:19:15.251,01:19:18.045,- Would you like to try one?
01:19:20.548,01:19:23.217,There's something I should tell you.
01:19:25.386,01:19:31.267,"While I was gone, I found the village where I was born."
01:19:31.392,01:19:35.646,I found out how I ended up in that radish basket.
01:19:35.771,01:19:37.064,You did?
01:19:37.690,01:19:39.442,I know who I am.
01:19:40.401,01:19:41.694,You do?
01:19:43.446,01:19:45.239,I'm your son.
01:19:51.370,01:19:52.955,"I love you, Dad."
01:19:54.373,01:19:56.083,"I love you, too, son."
01:19:58.877,01:20:01.714,"Ah. Delicious, fat radishes!"
01:20:01.838,01:20:04.300,You're probably hungry.
01:20:04.425,01:20:05.968,What are you talking about?
01:20:06.093,01:20:07.928,"- No, no, I'll cook."
01:20:08.053,01:20:10.097,It's the least I can do.
01:20:10.222,01:20:12.349,"No, it's the least I can do."
01:20:12.475,01:20:13.643,- Po.
01:20:13.768,01:20:15.436,- Po!
01:20:15.561,01:20:17.020,Let's both cook.
01:20:17.146,01:20:19.690,- Together.
01:20:19.815,01:20:21.275,"No, I'll cook."
01:20:56.310,01:20:58.771,My son is alive!
