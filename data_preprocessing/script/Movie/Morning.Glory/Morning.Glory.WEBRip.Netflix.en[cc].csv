00:00:34.576,00:00:35.744,-You must be... -Bill.
00:00:35.828,00:00:36.662,-Yeah. -Hi.
00:00:40.290,00:00:41.834,Thanks for having dinner so early.
00:00:41.917,00:00:44.003,"I know it's, uh... It's a pain."
00:00:44.085,00:00:46.129,"Oh, no, it's... It's, uh..."
00:00:47.255,00:00:48.841,Interesting crowd.
00:00:52.845,00:00:54.555,"I'm... I work at Good Morning, New Jersey and..."
00:00:54.638,00:00:56.015,"Right, on Channel 9, right?"
00:00:56.473,00:00:57.599,Right. Yeah.
00:00:57.683,00:01:06.901,"So, yeah, we're on really early, so I... I go to bed really early and we used to be on at, um, 5:00 a.m., but then we got bought by this, um, giant company and they wanted to run us instead of infomercials."
00:01:12.406,00:01:15.450,"Uh, sorry, I'm gonna turn this off. It's so..."
00:01:16.535,00:01:28.171,"Sorry. That's like, oh, my God, that's so annoying, I'm not gonna touch this ever again. Sorry."
00:01:28.255,00:01:29.256,"No, that's, it's..."
00:01:30.674,00:01:32.843,-It's okay. Huh? -It's okay.
00:01:35.846,00:01:39.307,I... I'm really glad that you picked this place. I...
00:01:40.059,00:01:43.520,"You know, it kind of reminds me of Matthews in Waldwick."
00:01:44.063,00:01:54.489,"They have the most amazing, like, delicious, And, um..."
00:01:56.199,00:01:59.327,Anyway... Boring!
00:01:59.411,00:02:00.245,Oh.
00:02:00.704,00:02:01.914,What do you do?
00:02:02.122,00:02:03.582,-Anna told me that you're in... -Marketing.
00:02:03.665,00:02:05.542,-Right. -For an insurance company.
00:02:12.925,00:02:16.344,"Sorry, it's... I... Oh, this is my boss."
00:02:16.428,00:02:18.388,-Go ahead. Take it. -Really?
00:02:18.472,00:02:20.099,"-Yeah. -Okay, great, thanks. Um..."
00:02:20.307,00:02:21.767,Just be a sec. Promise.
00:02:22.392,00:02:25.520,"Hi! Yeah, um, yeah."
00:02:25.771,00:02:27.648,"Yeah, I left three messages for his attorney. I don't know."
00:02:27.731,00:02:29.066,"If he doesn't call me back, I'm just gonna..."
00:02:29.149,00:02:30.818,I'm gonna... I'll wait outside his office.
00:02:43.246,00:02:44.957,"-Good morning, Becky. -Night, Jim."
00:03:01.140,00:03:02.766,Powerball lottery jackpot...
00:03:04.476,00:03:07.021,"Yes, but I did it in a really adorable way."
00:03:07.104,00:03:09.439,Rent a mini-rig. Cheaper and we can get closer to the action.
00:03:09.690,00:03:11.775,I was thinking we'd get someone in the winner's circle.
00:03:16.279,00:03:17.865,"MAN: Four, three..."
00:03:30.711,00:03:32.921,"MAN: Ready to dissolve to jib. Jib, ready to make your move."
00:03:33.088,00:03:34.464,"Ten seconds to air, everybody."
00:03:35.256,00:03:36.884,Ready to roll track and fade up under one.
00:03:37.592,00:03:40.261,"...three, two, one."
00:03:40.345,00:03:41.555,Roll track and fade up under one.
00:03:46.518,00:03:48.896,"Well, good morning, New Jersey. 4:38, if you're just waking up."
00:03:50.397,00:03:54.068,"Holland Tunnel still backed up, 'cause of an overturned big rig in the right and center lanes."
00:03:54.151,00:04:02.409,"Officials say this should be cleared up in about an hour, -But until then you should... -WOMAN: Is that snoring?"
00:04:02.492,00:04:04.828,"Oh, Jesus. Not again. Can you go to the single of Ralph, please?"
00:04:04.912,00:04:06.121,"-BECKY: Harry, Harry. -WOMAN: The Deko!"
00:04:06.205,00:04:07.956,Wrong lower third! The Deko!
00:04:08.040,00:04:10.291,...the hidden dangers that could be in your home.
00:04:11.085,00:04:14.129,All that and a look at sports at the top of the hour.
00:04:14.213,00:04:15.630,"Stick with us here at Good Morning, New Jersey."
00:04:17.340,00:04:18.425,"Nice shot, Fred. You're a stud."
00:04:18.508,00:04:19.467,No problemo.
00:04:26.767,00:04:29.019,"Hey, ho, whoo!"
00:04:29.228,00:04:30.729,-Hey. -Hi.
00:04:30.812,00:04:32.397,"Hey, I talked to Raymond in HR."
00:04:32.480,00:04:38.820,He said the company's reorganizing all the stations and they've budgeted us for a new senior producer.
00:04:39.947,00:04:43.575,"They pulled your employment records. You're getting it, Becky."
00:04:44.367,00:04:45.744,You're finally getting the job.
00:04:48.830,00:04:52.375,"Hey, kiddo, can you, uh, come by my office after the show?"
00:04:52.709,00:04:53.961,"Oh, me."
00:04:54.294,00:04:55.462,"No, not me, you."
00:05:06.431,00:05:08.267,"Make your move, jib, make your move, and..."
00:05:08.349,00:05:09.977,"And in Newark today, police arrested 12 members of..."
00:05:18.902,00:05:20.320,Ta-da!
00:05:22.697,00:05:24.324,We thought you might need this.
00:05:24.407,00:05:27.119,That better not be a box of condoms again and I didn't even use the old one.
00:05:27.202,00:05:28.912,"No, you're gonna use this."
00:05:33.834,00:05:35.294,"-Congratulations. -Yeah, congrats."
00:05:35.376,00:05:36.586,That's so sweet.
00:05:46.345,00:05:47.931,"Becky, we have to let you go."
00:05:49.057,00:05:51.434,"I'm really sorry about this, kiddo."
00:05:51.518,00:05:54.104,Corporate wants us to reduce our overhead.
00:05:54.313,00:06:00.819,We're having to make big cuts and they want me to hire a senior producer with more business experience to manage the contraction of the show.
00:06:00.902,00:06:02.988,"But wait a second. You told them that you can't do that, right?"
00:06:03.071,00:06:06.241,Because I... I've been here so long and I've worked so hard.
00:06:06.325,00:06:07.617,His name is Chip.
00:06:08.285,00:06:11.579,He... Chip starts Monday.
00:06:12.206,00:06:15.292,He has an MBA and a journalism degree from Columbia.
00:06:15.374,00:06:18.337,They're grooming him to run the whole station in a few years.
00:06:18.962,00:06:23.382,"In the meantime, I can't afford to keep you both."
00:06:25.510,00:06:28.347,"-Becky, look, I'm really... -Oh, shit."
00:06:28.763,00:06:32.184,"Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit."
00:06:32.267,00:06:35.062,"-Shitty, shitty, shit, shit. -Becky, I... I'm so sorry."
00:06:36.479,00:06:38.273,I fought them as hard as I could.
00:06:38.815,00:06:41.318,"There's lots of terrific opportunities out there, you know?"
00:06:41.400,00:06:43.695,"I mean, look at Chip. He got one."
00:06:43.820,00:06:46.698,"So, maybe this is just the push I need, you know?"
00:06:46.781,00:06:49.868,"To get me to the next level, maybe even to a network or..."
00:06:49.951,00:06:50.785,Yeah.
00:06:51.370,00:06:54.789,"I mean, it's... It's not like it's my whole life. It's only work, right?"
00:07:01.213,00:07:02.714,Did you get any severance?
00:07:04.632,00:07:05.466,Uh...
00:07:06.218,00:07:11.348,"There were some budgetary cuts, last year, so they weren't really offering."
00:07:11.431,00:07:14.434,But I have feelers out. Lots.
00:07:14.559,00:07:15.602,"Yeah, great."
00:07:15.685,00:07:20.774,"Honey, you think The Today Show is gonna call you up and hand you a job, and you have since you were eight, and it's not gonna happen."
00:07:20.857,00:07:23.110,"I don't... I know that, I do. I get it."
00:07:26.947,00:07:29.199,I let your father get your hopes up.
00:07:30.992,00:07:33.912,"He was not a happy person, let's face it."
00:07:35.163,00:07:39.418,"When he saw you aim high, he started to feel better about himself, so I never said anything."
00:07:39.500,00:07:40.627,What are you saying?
00:07:40.919,00:07:43.713,"You had a dream, you know? Great."
00:07:43.797,00:07:46.133,"When you were eight, it was adorable."
00:07:46.674,00:07:49.386,"When you were 18, it was inspiring."
00:07:49.636,00:07:52.973,"At 28, it's officially embarrassing."
00:07:54.308,00:07:57.978,And I just want you to stop before we get to heartbreaking.
00:08:28.258,00:08:32.346,"On my BlackBerry, it shows that you got my e-mail, so I was just wondering if..."
00:08:33.096,00:08:35.056,"Yeah, it shows when someone's opened it."
00:08:35.765,00:08:36.599,Hello?
00:08:36.850,00:08:38.185,BECKY: Becky Fuller. Yeah.
00:08:38.268,00:08:40.895,I just wanted to make sure that you got the resume that I e-mailed you.
00:08:40.979,00:08:42.397,You did. Great.
00:08:42.481,00:08:44.732,"Becky Fuller again. Um, I was just wondering if..."
00:08:46.109,00:08:49.404,"Yes, I did call yesterday, but I updated my resume last night and I thought that you might want..."
00:08:49.488,00:09:01.375,"I'm calling, because I was checking up on the position -MAN: Hi, Becky Fuller. -Hi."
00:09:01.458,00:09:04.419,"Oh, hi, this is Jerry Barnes calling from IBS in New York. How are you?"
00:09:04.627,00:09:06.213,Uh... Good.
00:09:06.671,00:09:12.010,"Terrific. Listen, I'm calling 'cause I received your resume, all, all five of them, actually."
00:09:12.093,00:09:15.347,"And it just so happens, uh, that we're looking for somebody..."
00:09:15.555,00:09:16.639,I'll take it.
00:09:17.265,00:09:19.184,"Well, wait, I haven't told you what it is yet."
00:09:19.726,00:09:23.021,"-Sorry. -Well, our morning show -has a vacancy and so... -I'll take it!"
00:09:23.104,00:09:28.109,"So, we're interviewing a bunch of people. Maybe you can come in -and we can have a talk. -Sure. Absolutely."
00:09:28.193,00:09:30.570,Just tell me where to go and who to talk to.
00:09:30.862,00:09:34.657,"Okay, I'll get you an e-mail with the details of where we are in the city."
00:09:34.741,00:09:36.659,-Sorry! -And shall we say 3:00?
00:09:36.743,00:09:38.495,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
00:09:53.760,00:09:57.013,Oscar says you're very talented and you work incredibly hard.
00:09:57.222,00:10:01.017,Says you're the most promising producer that he's ever fired.
00:10:01.184,00:10:04.771,"Oh, well, that's, that's good. I think."
00:10:04.938,00:10:06.398,"Uh, so you're a fan of our morning program?"
00:10:06.481,00:10:09.234,"Oh, yeah, I think it has so many..."
00:10:09.317,00:10:11.111,"Yeah, we know it's terrible."
00:10:11.194,00:10:17.284,"Perpetually in fourth place behind The Today Show, Good Morning America and that thing on CBS, whatever it's called."
00:10:17.367,00:10:19.660,It's a source of constant humiliation.
00:10:19.744,00:10:25.333,"Last year, in the network softball league, the CBS team wore hats that said, At least we're not Daybreak."
00:10:25.417,00:10:30.088,"The anchors of the show are, uh, difficult and semi-talented."
00:10:30.171,00:10:32.090,"Oh, I think Colleen Peck is a pro."
00:10:32.173,00:10:33.467,-Heinous. -Uh...
00:10:33.550,00:10:36.303,-Paul McVee is a fine reporter. -Foul.
00:10:38.346,00:10:41.849,Okay. Is Daybreak a shitty show? Yes.
00:10:42.601,00:10:45.312,But it's on a network. And not just any network.
00:10:45.395,00:10:49.566,This is one of the most legendary news divisions in the entire history of television!
00:10:49.649,00:10:58.116,"Daybreak just needs someone who believes in it, who understands that a national platform is an invaluable resource, that no story is too low or too high to reach for!"
00:10:59.493,00:11:01.369,Are you gonna sing?
00:11:03.246,00:11:05.706,"Look, Mr. Barnes. Jerry."
00:11:05.790,00:11:08.585,-Daybreak's facilities are antiquated. -Uh-huh.
00:11:08.668,00:11:12.547,"It's understaffed, underfunded. Oh, and the pay."
00:11:12.631,00:11:16.176,"-Mmm-hmm. -It's awful, about half of what you made at Hey, How The Hell Are You, New Jersey?"
00:11:16.259,00:11:19.678,You've never been an executive producer. You're too young.
00:11:19.929,00:11:29.981,"Nobody's ever heard of you. And here, your education, three, not four, years, at Fairleigh Dickinson in Teaneck, also known as Fairly Ridiculous. Did I miss anything?"
00:11:33.692,00:11:38.990,"Daybreak needs what I need, someone who believes that it can succeed."
00:11:39.366,00:11:44.621,"Trust me, I know you don't have any reason to believe in me, but I work harder than anyone else."
00:11:44.829,00:11:46.581,"I'm in first, I'm out last."
00:11:46.665,00:11:55.298,I know a shitload more about the news than someone whose daddy paid them to smoke bongs and talk semiotics at Harvard and I devote myself completely to my job. It's what I do.
00:11:55.382,00:11:56.883,It's all I am. I...
00:12:02.055,00:12:02.930,"Well, that's..."
00:12:04.807,00:12:05.933,embarrassing.
00:12:09.854,00:12:10.689,Okay.
00:12:12.357,00:12:18.238,"Thanks for the tour, and, uh, thanks for... Uh, for..."
00:12:19.155,00:12:20.073,Thanks.
00:12:34.212,00:12:35.714,It's these buttons right here.
00:12:36.673,00:12:39.593,"Oh, oh, uh, lobby. Yes, thanks."
00:12:42.761,00:12:43.888,Good day so far?
00:12:45.139,00:12:46.849,"Oh, I don't think so."
00:12:48.226,00:12:49.768,I talked too much. Ruined it.
00:13:08.121,00:13:10.457,I am such a huge admirer of yours.
00:13:10.540,00:13:14.168,"I'm a... I'm a big, huge fan. I..."
00:13:14.711,00:13:17.130,"Oh, my whole family watched you, growing up. I..."
00:13:17.631,00:13:21.760,"Of all the anchors, you were, by far, the greatest reporter."
00:13:25.472,00:13:26.847,She work for you?
00:13:26.931,00:13:27.766,No.
00:13:28.224,00:13:30.268,I'm just here to teach her how to use the elevator.
00:13:32.562,00:13:34.939,"Yes, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
00:13:35.231,00:13:36.149,May I?
00:13:36.733,00:13:37.900,"Oh, God, sorry. I..."
00:13:37.984,00:13:39.818,"Of course, of course."
00:13:42.656,00:13:43.740,Wait a second. You know him.
00:13:43.822,00:13:44.991,"Yes, I do know him."
00:14:06.137,00:14:08.181,-Hello? -JERRY: Becky Fuller.
00:14:08.723,00:14:09.557,Yes?
00:14:10.350,00:14:11.559,You sure you can do this job?
00:14:11.643,00:14:12.560,Yes.
00:14:13.353,00:14:14.395,You start on Monday.
00:14:14.479,00:14:15.522,Thank you.
00:14:23.780,00:14:26.866,"Yes, I am calling about, uh, the one-bedroom."
00:14:27.283,00:14:30.620,"Yes, I'm moving into town. I've got a new job."
00:14:30.870,00:14:32.539,I'm extremely neat and tidy.
00:14:33.581,00:14:36.334,In summer camp the kids used to pay me to make their beds.
00:14:38.961,00:14:40.588,No loud music. No kids.
00:14:40.880,00:14:42.841,I don't even have a boyfriend. Just me.
00:14:43.090,00:14:44.634,"I'll take it. I'll take it, I'll take it."
00:15:00.900,00:15:01.735,Sorry!
00:15:04.612,00:15:05.446,Sorry!
00:15:07.657,00:15:08.575,Sorry!
00:15:22.714,00:15:25.216,"Also, we'll have more on the flooding in Iowa."
00:15:25.299,00:15:28.177,"Finally, some good weather news on the way for those folks."
00:15:28.261,00:15:33.683,"So please join us tomorrow and thank you for spending -your morning here at Daybreak. -Take care, everyone."
00:15:33.767,00:15:35.810,-Are you interviewing at Daybreak? -Goodbye.
00:15:35.935,00:15:37.562,Assistant? Intern?
00:15:37.812,00:15:41.190,"Uh, no. Actually, I'm the new executive producer."
00:15:41.608,00:15:42.650,Another one?
00:15:44.026,00:15:44.861,Mmm-hmm.
00:15:46.320,00:15:47.363,Don't unpack.
00:15:49.156,00:15:51.075,"Ms. Fuller? Lenny Bergman, Senior Producer."
00:15:54.621,00:15:59.751,"You started out at WABC. You were at CBS for two years, -and here for 13. -Yeah, wow."
00:15:59.834,00:16:02.712,"-Here, let me... Let me give you a hand. -Oh, I just have one question."
00:16:02.962,00:16:05.047,-Sure. -Why haven't they bumped you up?
00:16:05.298,00:16:09.469,"Oh, it's not for me. I did it for a couple of weeks once, but they put me back at number two."
00:16:09.552,00:16:11.429,"Apparently, the crying was distracting."
00:16:11.763,00:16:13.097,"You'll love it, though. It's a great job."
00:16:13.180,00:16:15.099,Our morning meetings are at 5:00.
00:16:15.433,00:16:17.435,"Uh, isn't that kind of late?"
00:16:17.518,00:16:19.813,"-LENNY: Late? -I mean, it's just that, um..."
00:16:19.896,00:16:23.608,"I'm... I'm used to, uh, early hours, so..."
00:16:23.691,00:16:25.359,"Well, maybe we should try better donuts."
00:16:27.737,00:16:32.199,"Uh, at The Today Show, the senior staff is usually... Hi. In by 4:30..."
00:16:32.283,00:16:36.746,"Oh, we're just like The Today Show, except, you know, without the money, -viewers, respect. But very similar. -Okay."
00:16:38.915,00:16:41.709,"Whoa, that's... That's one of our good doorknobs."
00:16:42.209,00:16:43.377,Let me take care of this.
00:16:43.461,00:16:46.965,Colleen Peck has been here forever. Don't mention that.
00:16:47.173,00:16:49.801,"But McVee is paid more. Don't mention that, either."
00:16:49.884,00:16:51.636,They hate each other. Don't mention that.
00:16:51.719,00:16:54.263,But that's because Colleen hates everybody. Don't mention that.
00:16:54.347,00:16:57.892,"And she used to sleep with McVee, who threw her over for her assistant."
00:16:57.976,00:16:59.644,-BOTH: Do not mention that. -Got it.
00:16:59.727,00:17:01.312,"-After you talk to Colleen... -Yeah, yeah?"
00:17:01.395,00:17:04.231,"Make sure you get me before you talk to McVee, so I can go with you."
00:17:04.607,00:17:05.608,Why?
00:17:06.108,00:17:07.694,"I... Just trust me, okay?"
00:17:08.736,00:17:09.654,-Okay. -Okay.
00:17:09.737,00:17:10.571,-Okay. -Good.
00:17:10.905,00:17:13.491,"-Oh, can I just... -Sure. Okay, you ready?"
00:17:13.992,00:17:15.451,-I'm ready. -Good luck.
00:17:22.375,00:17:25.586,Do you know how many EPs I've had in the past 11 years? Hmm?
00:17:26.462,00:17:28.088,-Um... -Fourteen.
00:17:28.422,00:17:31.384,"If they're stupid, they get fired, and if they're smart, they quit."
00:17:35.429,00:17:37.807,"-Um, well, um... -Mmm-hmm."
00:17:37.891,00:17:47.817,-It's a real pleasure... -Do you think it's fun being in last place? Do you think I enjoy working for a network that spends more on one episode of the dating show about a bachelor dwarf than our entire weekly budget?
00:17:47.901,00:17:48.735,No...
00:17:48.818,00:17:52.071,And I've never had a decent co-anchor ever!
00:17:52.154,00:17:55.867,-We're gonna change... -Just a revolving door of cretinous morons.
00:17:55.950,00:17:58.536,-Our ratings are in the crapper. -I know. I...
00:17:58.619,00:18:01.622,"I mean, how long can this show limp along like this?"
00:18:01.706,00:18:06.753,"I know that everyone's been through a lot, and I know that there's been so many challenges along the way. But, you know..."
00:18:06.836,00:18:11.591,"You will fail like everyone else and then you'll be gone, like everyone else."
00:18:11.674,00:18:15.803,"But I will still be here, pulling the train up the hill with my teeth."
00:18:15.929,00:18:17.722,You think it's fun getting your ass kicked?
00:18:17.805,00:18:19.515,-No... -Welcome to Daybreak.
00:18:19.766,00:18:21.392,"Enjoy the pain, Gidget."
00:18:23.978,00:18:27.065,No! It's okay. I have it! I've done this a zillion times and...
00:18:27.147,00:18:29.149,I'm gonna fix that and...
00:18:29.233,00:18:30.735,"-See you later! Good talking to you. -Okay, I'll..."
00:18:34.864,00:18:39.243,Paul! Hi! I'm... I'm Becky Fuller.
00:18:39.535,00:18:42.956,Your new EP. Thrilled to meet you.
00:18:43.039,00:18:45.750,"Uh, I was just thinking maybe we could go over a few ideas."
00:18:45.833,00:18:48.795,I was thinking that maybe we could get you on the street and do some remotes.
00:18:48.878,00:18:52.924,"Yeah, I don't like to leave the studio. I like climate control."
00:18:53.132,00:18:58.262,"But, uh, if you want, we could discuss this further privately."
00:19:00.222,00:19:02.266,-What size are your feet? -Hmm?
00:19:02.349,00:19:04.143,-You wear about a six and half? Seven? -Pardon?
00:19:04.226,00:19:05.645,How do you feel about having them photographed?
00:19:07.354,00:19:08.188,Good?
00:19:08.815,00:19:09.857,Feel good about that?
00:19:09.941,00:19:11.985,-Hmm. -You should. I keep 'em very classy.
00:19:12.068,00:19:13.903,I don't...
00:19:13.987,00:19:16.238,Can I show you my blog? Sexy Feet?
00:19:17.991,00:19:19.033,No.
00:19:19.117,00:19:20.827,"-Well, I met Paul. -You talked to him alone?"
00:19:20.910,00:19:22.745,"-I told you to come see me first. -I know, but..."
00:19:22.829,00:19:26.833,"What was I gonna do? Hi, hi, everyone. Hi, I... I'm Becky."
00:19:27.041,00:19:28.709,Hi. Good morning.
00:19:32.713,00:19:34.674,"McVee. So shocking, huh?"
00:19:34.757,00:19:37.718,"Yeah, well, Mr. McVee doesn't always come to these things."
00:19:38.761,00:19:42.140,"Oh, um, could you tell Paul that we need him, please? Thanks."
00:19:42.515,00:19:46.185,"Um, okay, so let's just dive in, shall we? Uh..."
00:19:46.853,00:19:48.270,Who... Who wants to start?
00:19:48.437,00:19:50.356,Tomorrow Rocco DiSpirito wants to make lasagna.
00:19:50.439,00:19:53.985,"I told him we did that last week with the Barefoot Contessa, but he's insisting. What do I do?"
00:19:54.068,00:19:56.696,"For the segment on miniskirts, do you want all size models..."
00:19:56.779,00:20:01.993,"For next week, I want to do a piece on juice cleanses. All the celebs are doing them and they have amazing powers of rejuvenization."
00:20:02.076,00:20:06.122,"My idea is that I get a juice cleanse and then we can, like, measure my toxins..."
00:20:06.205,00:20:09.542,"For the Carville interview... I'm sorry, Lisa, do you want the living room set or the stools?"
00:20:09.625,00:20:13.546,ABC says we can't have Eva Longoria until two weeks after she does GMA. What do we do?
00:20:13.629,00:20:16.174,"On psychic animals, would you prefer a parakeet or an iguana?"
00:20:16.256,00:20:18.134,I'd like to do a piece on weathervanes. They are fascinating.
00:20:18.217,00:20:22.388,"Like, did you know the word vane comes from the Old English fana, which means flag or weathercock?"
00:20:22.471,00:20:25.141,"Friday, for cooking with squash, inside or on the plaza?"
00:20:25.224,00:20:28.519,"Okay, they're offering us the third lead in the new Patrick Dempsey movie. Do you want him?"
00:20:28.602,00:20:30.521,MAN: Great story out of Tampa about a retirement account scandal.
00:20:30.604,00:20:32.648,But we got to move quick. Should we send a team or just local talent?
00:20:32.732,00:20:34.775,Mixing board in the control room's on the fritz. 10 grand to fix it.
00:20:34.859,00:20:42.491,"For that piece on baby food, do we want an actual baby, and if so, white, black, Hispanic, Asian, blonde hair, brown hair, teeth, or no teeth?"
00:20:42.575,00:20:44.160,I have a black baby at home.
00:20:48.915,00:20:51.291,"I'm sorry, I can't hear what you're saying. I..."
00:20:51.375,00:20:56.380,"Hello! Hi, hi. Does someone wanna tell me why I had to log off BangingGrannies.com for this?"
00:21:05.514,00:21:08.226,"Tell Rocco if he insists on making lasagna, he will be bumped."
00:21:08.308,00:21:11.520,"Yes, all size models, but skirts not too short. Toxins?"
00:21:11.604,00:21:13.313,"Who said that? Yeah, they can't be measured."
00:21:13.397,00:21:15.566,"And rejuvenization, not a word."
00:21:15.649,00:21:19.862,Tell Longoria's people that she can't plug her next film unless we get her within a week of GMA...
00:21:20.154,00:21:22.531,"Parakeet. Ernie, weathercock? Seriously?"
00:21:22.615,00:21:24.491,The plaza for squash. I want Patrick Dempsey.
00:21:24.575,00:21:27.703,Tell his people we'll run him in the first hour and he can talk about whatever his thing is.
00:21:27.787,00:21:29.622,"Tampa Bay, definitely local talent."
00:21:29.705,00:21:31.165,And we've got to fix that sound board.
00:21:31.249,00:21:32.541,Find that 10 grand in the budget somewhere.
00:21:32.625,00:21:34.127,"The hair and makeup numbers, those were too high."
00:21:34.210,00:21:36.378,"So, Colleen, could you share your hair person with Lisa on her days?"
00:21:36.462,00:21:38.881,"-COLLEEN: I'd like to talk to you about that. -Great. Asian baby, no teeth."
00:21:38.965,00:21:40.174,"-Lesbian parents. -Oh, okay."
00:21:42.551,00:21:43.636,"Oh, Paul!"
00:21:43.844,00:21:44.804,Uh...
00:21:47.640,00:21:48.599,You're fired.
00:21:49.892,00:21:51.018,You're adorable.
00:21:51.351,00:21:52.394,Fired!
00:22:05.158,00:22:07.326,I'm sorry. That was unprofessional.
00:22:14.000,00:22:18.462,"Congratulations. The first day, you flushed your anchor and you got no money to pay for another one."
00:22:18.545,00:22:20.256,He was lowering the morale of the show.
00:22:20.464,00:22:22.091,How is that possible?
00:22:22.716,00:22:24.426,"BECKY: Look, you must have someone under contract."
00:22:24.510,00:22:27.263,"A local anchor, a reporter. I'll find someone."
00:22:27.345,00:22:30.057,I'll promote from within. That'll be great for morale!
00:22:30.141,00:22:32.476,Go nuts. Find somebody great. It just can't cost me a penny.
00:22:34.187,00:22:36.189,What if I gave them one of my three pennies?
00:22:36.563,00:22:39.441,Whatever it takes. Just get the ratings up.
00:22:45.198,00:22:47.491,"Lenny, hi. Yeah. Very positive."
00:22:47.574,00:22:49.409,He thinks we have terrific options.
00:22:49.952,00:22:52.538,...200 points right before closing.
00:22:52.663,00:22:54.248,Analysts fear that this...
00:22:54.332,00:22:55.499,He's not bad.
00:22:56.250,00:22:59.086,"Yeah, he's okay. Put a saddle on him, he's good to go."
00:22:59.170,00:23:00.378,...are not happy.
00:23:00.796,00:23:03.132,Should we watch 86 again?
00:23:03.216,00:23:07.094,"I got to get home, see the kids, or the wife is gonna kill me."
00:23:07.178,00:23:08.428,You have kids?
00:23:09.805,00:23:11.557,What? No.
00:23:12.058,00:23:13.893,No? Husband? Boyfriend?
00:23:17.271,00:23:18.981,"No, I'm sorry. Stupid question."
00:23:19.065,00:23:20.191,"Um, you know..."
00:23:20.274,00:23:21.942,You're hideous and repulsive.
00:23:22.026,00:23:23.319,You know what? Forget 86.
00:23:23.401,00:23:29.742,"I think that we should watch the Miami guy again, 'cause he was, I mean, you know, he was a little bit tan, but I think..."
00:23:29.992,00:23:33.371,"I think that we could just wipe that off, 'cause it's probably just one of those self-tanner things."
00:23:33.495,00:23:35.956,"BECKY: I could, you know, fix that."
00:23:36.790,00:23:37.666,Good night.
00:23:39.126,00:23:41.128,"Hey, look. It's Mike Pomeroy's fan girl."
00:23:44.215,00:23:45.299,-Hello. -Hey.
00:23:45.383,00:23:46.217,That was you.
00:23:46.342,00:23:48.135,That was really embarrassing.
00:23:53.182,00:23:55.559,"I, uh... Becky Fuller. Sorry."
00:23:55.642,00:23:57.311,Becky Fuller Becky Fuller?
00:23:57.395,00:24:00.314,The one who took out McVee? You're a legend already.
00:24:00.398,00:24:02.191,"-Oh, thanks. -I'm Adam Bennett."
00:24:02.275,00:24:04.360,I'm a producer upstairs at Seven Days.
00:24:04.442,00:24:06.279,-Hello. -So you looking for a new anchor?
00:24:06.528,00:24:07.571,Yes.
00:24:07.654,00:24:08.989,"Oh, not that guy."
00:24:09.282,00:24:11.325,You can't use that guy. That's the horse guy.
00:24:11.409,00:24:18.332,"Oh, he's not too bad. I mean, as long as we leave our hand flat Well, good luck, Becky Fuller."
00:24:18.416,00:24:20.626,"Thank you, Adam Bennett."
00:24:21.543,00:24:22.586,Need any help?
00:24:22.836,00:24:24.630,"Uh, no. I'm good. Thanks."
00:24:26.340,00:24:29.760,The sports guy from St. Louis is not bad. Let's watch him again.
00:24:29.843,00:24:33.306,"No, we need some gravitas. We need people to trust us."
00:24:33.389,00:24:37.226,"I mean, you know, if news breaks on the air, we need to be able to cover it credibly."
00:24:37.310,00:24:40.146,"What, do you actually think that we can cover breaking news?"
00:24:42.398,00:24:46.986,Thousands gathered today to see if the tiny buck-toothed creature would spot his own shadow.
00:24:47.069,00:24:54.160,"But the sad tooth is, according to Punxsutawney Phil, this bitter winter is far from over. Back to you, Mike."
00:24:59.665,00:25:04.753,"Yesterday, the Secretary of State held a top-level What's funny?"
00:25:04.837,00:25:06.255,You put Seabiscuit back in?
00:25:06.339,00:25:10.676,MIKE: But we agree that Hezbollah has shown a willingness to continue to attack.
00:25:10.759,00:25:11.593,Becky?
00:25:12.261,00:25:13.429,Can I call you back?
00:25:13.511,00:25:15.597,...continuing Israeli incursions.
00:25:16.015,00:25:20.769,What steps are you taking to limit these Hezbollah retaliations?
00:25:21.270,00:25:23.521,"You have Pomeroy under contract, right?"
00:25:24.273,00:25:28.319,Yeah. He was supposed to do stories for one of our magazine shows.
00:25:28.402,00:25:30.404,-Yeah? -We couldn't use anything he pitched.
00:25:30.696,00:25:36.035,-Nothing? -An eight-part story on the United Nations. An interview with a Pashtun warlord.
00:25:36.118,00:25:39.997,A piece on micro-finance in Asia? It's all been so tempting.
00:25:40.080,00:25:41.539,Jerry! Jerry!
00:25:41.623,00:25:42.791,So we're just paying him to sit there.
00:25:43.083,00:25:45.836,Wait. But he must have millions on his contract.
00:25:45.919,00:25:48.255,You have a world-caliber news man with nothing to do!
00:25:48.339,00:25:54.428,"Becky, this is... No, Pomeroy has reported on every major story of the last three decades, with integrity and courage!"
00:25:54.512,00:25:57.555,"I mean, he was the only anchor to go down to Ground Zero on the day."
00:25:57.639,00:26:01.310,"His Q ratings, I looked at them, they're unbelievable, and you're already paying him."
00:26:01.394,00:26:03.521,I have to go. We'll discuss this.
00:26:05.481,00:26:07.400,I want to look at his contract!
00:26:07.649,00:26:09.735,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hi.
00:26:09.902,00:26:13.780,I need your approval to look at his contract.
00:26:16.075,00:26:17.117,Please.
00:26:43.977,00:26:44.853,Hi.
00:26:46.063,00:26:46.980,Hi.
00:26:49.525,00:26:54.029,"I'm Becky Fuller and, uh, we actually met the other day in the elevator."
00:26:55.406,00:26:57.199,And what the hell are you doing here?
00:26:57.866,00:27:01.412,I'm the producer of Daybreak and we're actually looking for a new anchor.
00:27:02.746,00:27:04.415,Then why are you here?
00:27:07.126,00:27:08.961,Go away.
00:27:09.795,00:27:13.090,"Okay, just hear me out, because the show actually has a lot of potential."
00:27:13.173,00:27:29.815,"We're starting over basically, You've been a journalist your whole life, ever since your elementary school paper, The Beaverton Bee."
00:27:29.940,00:27:31.984,"I mean, you've got to miss it. You..."
00:27:32.067,00:27:34.403,"News breaks, it must just kill you not to be out there."
00:27:34.487,00:27:36.489,Morning shows don't do news.
00:27:37.197,00:27:41.577,"Jesus, Daybreak. Half the people that watch your show have lost their remote."
00:27:41.743,00:27:44.538,The other half are waiting for their nurse to turn them over.
00:27:45.247,00:27:48.584,"If I wanted to come back, I could have any job I chose."
00:27:48.666,00:27:51.378,But you can't work on another network for another two years.
00:27:51.629,00:27:55.673,So I'll continue to enjoy my life on IBS's dime.
00:27:55.799,00:27:58.260,"All right, all right, I didn't want to have to do this. I really didn't."
00:27:58.344,00:28:00.804,-I looked at your contract. -What?
00:28:00.887,00:28:01.972,With the lawyers.
00:28:02.055,00:28:03.265,My contract?
00:28:03.390,00:28:06.352,And you're right. They do have to pay you for the last two years of your contract.
00:28:06.435,00:28:09.687,Unless six months have elapsed without you appearing on the air in any capacity.
00:28:09.771,00:28:16.862,"Then, if the network offers you an official position and you don't take it, they can terminate your contract and the $6 million that you have left on it."
00:28:17.779,00:28:20.949,"So, here's me with an official offer."
00:28:24.828,00:28:26.872,the position of co-host of Daybreak.
00:28:31.043,00:28:31.960,You're joking.
00:28:33.671,00:28:35.255,"No. Actually, I'm not."
00:28:36.632,00:28:38.592,Do you have any idea what's going on in the world?
00:28:38.676,00:28:43.263,And you want me to do stories about baked Alaska?
00:28:46.517,00:28:48.477,You just need to have an open mind.
00:28:48.561,00:28:51.397,"-Open mind. -I mean, yes, the morning news has a wider range of stories..."
00:28:53.524,00:28:57.361,"Your program is in the news department, you cretin!"
00:28:57.570,00:29:00.030,News is a sacred temple.
00:29:00.113,00:29:04.159,And you're part of the cabal that's ruining it with horseshit!
00:29:04.284,00:29:05.785,That's not actually fair.
00:29:05.869,00:29:09.248,Because the first half hour of a morning show is a damn fine news broadcast.
00:29:09.331,00:29:10.749,"Sure, we cover the news and entertainment."
00:29:10.832,00:29:12.959,That's everything a newspaper has ever done.
00:29:13.043,00:29:15.087,There's nothing wrong with that. Think of it this way.
00:29:15.170,00:29:20.300,"We're like a well-informed neighbor, coming over to chat with people in the morning. You know, Brokaw did the morning news."
00:29:20.384,00:29:22.969,And Charlie Gibson. Walter Cronkite did it at the beginning of his career.
00:29:23.053,00:29:26.473,"I mean, he co-hosted a morning program with a puppet named Charlemagne."
00:29:33.855,00:29:40.987,"WOMAN: It's inexpensive and uses things -WOMAN: You can make globes, hats... -COLLEEN: Mmm-hmm."
00:29:41.071,00:29:42.155,WOMAN: Especially pinatas.
00:29:42.239,00:29:49.162,"Now, mache means to chew in French, but we're not actually going to be eating any of this, right?"
00:29:51.790,00:29:52.750,No.
00:29:53.542,00:29:56.044,"Coming up next, you've heard her sing."
00:29:56.128,00:29:58.797,"Well, today, you're going to hear about her sweet tooth."
00:29:59.089,00:30:03.260,Join us as we bake brownies with Celine Dion's personal chef.
00:30:03.343,00:30:06.221,"-All that and more, coming up on Daybreak. -Bye."
00:30:06.305,00:30:07.139,We're clear!
00:30:07.723,00:30:10.892,"Oh, my God, will somebody please get this off? Thank you, thank you."
00:30:11.310,00:30:12.561,Thank you very much.
00:30:12.811,00:30:16.315,"Okay, so, we don't have time for the sit-down, so we're just gonna run the package, all right?"
00:30:16.398,00:30:17.441,Are you okay?
00:30:18.233,00:30:19.067,What?
00:30:19.151,00:30:22.821,Don't beat yourself up. He was never gonna do it. Pomeroy?
00:30:22.904,00:30:24.114,How did you know that?
00:30:24.364,00:30:30.788,"Mike was never gonna come to work at this little dog and pony show, especially not working for somebody -like, well, I'm sorry, but you. -Like, yeah."
00:30:30.870,00:30:40.714,"You. Not in a thousand years. I mean, obviously, don't get me wrong, Oh, my God."
00:31:00.526,00:31:02.068,I've won eight Peabodys.
00:31:02.986,00:31:04.070,A Pulitzer.
00:31:04.613,00:31:06.114,Sixteen Emmys.
00:31:07.616,00:31:09.951,I was shot through the forearm in Bosnia.
00:31:10.786,00:31:13.622,Pulled Colin Powell from a burning Jeep.
00:31:14.456,00:31:20.713,I laid a cool washcloth on Mother Teresa's forehead during a cholera epidemic.
00:31:21.588,00:31:25.008,I had lunch with Dick Cheney.
00:31:31.807,00:31:32.891,That is correct.
00:31:34.768,00:31:37.521,"WOMAN: Five, four, three..."
00:31:37.979,00:31:39.189,"Oh, fuck."
00:31:41.692,00:31:45.654,"God, does he cook? Does he do... I don't know, fashion segments and gossip?"
00:31:45.738,00:31:49.491,Does he have three-year-old octuplets barf all over him like I did last year?
00:31:49.575,00:31:52.411,"Well, unfortunately, in the '80s, someone gave him story refusal rights, so no."
00:31:52.494,00:31:55.497,"Oh, I don't even care. Does he know that this is called morning television?"
00:31:55.581,00:31:59.752,"BECKY: Yes, and I think that after a little bit of time, he's really gonna want to do a mix of stories."
00:31:59.835,00:32:04.256,Face it! I'm going to end up making turkey meatballs with Mario Batali for the rest of my natural life.
00:32:04.339,00:32:06.091,MAN: I need the new titles ASAP.
00:32:06.174,00:32:11.889,"LENNY: Okay, folks, let's move it. Single malt. We've got the hand soap, we got the mixers, the papers, and tropical fruit."
00:32:11.971,00:32:14.015,Here we go. Whoever heard of mangosteen?
00:32:14.391,00:32:15.642,"Apparently, he has."
00:32:15.726,00:32:22.357,"This is Colleen's dressing room and, um... She's so looking forward to seeing you."
00:32:22.733,00:32:24.818,Good. Great. Glad to hear it.
00:32:26.695,00:32:29.114,"MIKE: And, uh, this is mine?"
00:32:29.531,00:32:31.617,"BECKY: Yes, but Colleen is, um..."
00:32:32.534,00:32:33.702,Never mind.
00:32:34.620,00:32:36.037,You got me the newspapers? Mmm-hmm.
00:32:36.121,00:32:37.122,The mixers?
00:32:38.749,00:32:40.292,The tropical fruit plate.
00:32:46.298,00:32:47.257,Nice of you.
00:32:47.716,00:32:48.550,Yes...
00:32:49.468,00:32:53.513,"If Colleen wants me, I'll be in here."
00:32:55.808,00:32:56.725,Okay.
00:33:00.854,00:33:04.566,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He should come in here."
00:33:07.903,00:33:08.987,Okay.
00:33:09.070,00:33:10.530,What the hell is that?
00:33:11.573,00:33:12.616,No hurry.
00:33:14.493,00:33:16.369,No. No and no.
00:33:18.914,00:33:19.998,Okay.
00:33:20.081,00:33:22.668,Did you tell her I have papaya in here?
00:33:23.168,00:33:27.756,He gets a tropical fruit plate? That is just so pathetic.
00:33:29.675,00:33:31.176,BECKY: That guy might be our only hope.
00:33:31.259,00:33:34.596,So I suggest you just man up and get in there!
00:33:34.680,00:33:36.723,Whoo! That is such a good speech!
00:33:36.974,00:33:39.726,Guess what? I'm not going.
00:33:49.152,00:33:53.907,"So, we'll be shooting Mike's promos all week and then, uh, we'll finalize the format of the show on Friday."
00:33:53.991,00:33:56.242,And then we'll rehearse Mike's openings and some segues.
00:33:56.326,00:33:59.454,Excuse me. Who is going to say goodbye?
00:34:01.206,00:34:03.917,"-Pardon? -Well, at the end of the show?"
00:34:04.877,00:34:07.086,"Oh, uh, it doesn't really matter."
00:34:07.170,00:34:09.381,"I mean, Mike, you don't mind if Colleen says goodbye?"
00:34:09.548,00:34:12.258,"Well, who do you think the public would rather hear from last?"
00:34:12.509,00:34:20.058,Someone who's won every broadcast award on the face of the planet or the former Miss Pacoima?
00:34:21.018,00:34:23.562,It's Arizona!
00:34:23.729,00:34:26.690,"In case you're interested, I was Miss Arizona!"
00:34:37.242,00:34:39.494,We can't both have our arms folded.
00:34:39.786,00:34:41.914,"And I am the female here, I think."
00:34:42.039,00:34:43.456,Colleen on this side.
00:34:43.540,00:34:44.666,"Of course, I'd be more than happy to."
00:34:53.383,00:34:55.552,"Can you just step away, just for a second? Thanks."
00:34:56.219,00:34:58.179,We don't want to take up your precious... Hello?
00:34:59.639,00:35:00.933,Is that better?
00:35:01.767,00:35:03.476,What's next? Bubble bath?
00:35:06.229,00:35:07.731,Hey. Hi!
00:35:11.109,00:35:16.740,"Hey, I just came to, uh... To offer my condolences on hiring the third worst person in the world."
00:35:21.327,00:35:25.457,"Yes. I, um... Who are the other two?"
00:35:25.707,00:35:30.587,"Oh, Kim Jong Il and Angela Lansbury, actually."
00:35:31.088,00:35:32.297,She knows what she did.
00:35:32.965,00:35:34.007,Okay.
00:35:34.382,00:35:38.511,"So, I, uh... I gather that you worked with Mike at the Nightly News."
00:35:38.804,00:35:45.102,"Worst year of my life. The entire time we worked together, the only thing he ever called me was Senor Dipshit."
00:35:48.146,00:35:49.272,"-I'm sorry, that's not funny. -No."
00:35:49.355,00:35:51.817,"That's terrible. That is terrible, actually."
00:35:51.984,00:35:53.526,"Yeah, so, um..."
00:35:54.027,00:35:57.072,So now is an excellent time for you to take up drinking.
00:35:57.155,00:36:06.706,"And, uh... And I came by to say that sometimes after work, a few of us go over to Schiller's on Madison, -so, you know, if you're ever around... -Oh."
00:36:07.165,00:36:08.083,Around.
00:36:08.667,00:36:10.043,"Yeah, available."
00:36:10.127,00:36:15.256,"Oh, okay. Yeah. Um, that, uh, would be nice..."
00:36:15.340,00:36:24.432,"Yeah, I... I don't... I don't really go out very much, but if I'm in the neighborhood, -I will definitely stop by and say hi. -Well, like tomorrow."
00:36:24.724,00:36:25.558,Around 8:00.
00:36:25.809,00:36:27.477,"Okay. Yeah, sounds good."
00:36:28.728,00:36:29.562,"-All right. -Sure, yeah."
00:36:32.649,00:36:35.527,That's not too shabby. You got a new anchor.
00:36:35.610,00:36:39.447,Somebody asked you out on a date. Things are looking up.
00:36:40.239,00:36:43.035,"Um, that was... He... Not asking me out on a date."
00:36:43.118,00:36:44.911,I think it was. I was standing right there.
00:36:45.162,00:36:46.872,"-Uh, no, no. -Yeah."
00:36:46.955,00:36:50.125,He was just mentioning that he might be somewhere. I mean...
00:36:50.458,00:36:54.629,"Oh, come on, please, I think I would know -if I was being asked out on a date. -It's a date."
00:36:54.713,00:36:58.341,"So, we've got the bird whisperer -confirmed for Tuesday? -Yes."
00:36:58.424,00:37:00.635,"Great. And, uh... Al Green on the plaza Wednesday."
00:37:00.719,00:37:01.887,-Two songs. -Okay.
00:37:02.095,00:37:04.848,"And, Colleen, do you want to do the interview between the songs?"
00:37:08.018,00:37:09.519,"Oh, no, let me."
00:37:16.401,00:37:21.614,"Okay. Mike, so we have this great story on children's water safety."
00:37:24.076,00:37:25.243,Not my thing.
00:37:26.870,00:37:30.665,"Okay, how about a rundown of the new shows on the fall television season?"
00:37:30.749,00:37:32.584,"Oh, yeah. That's a no."
00:37:32.918,00:37:37.380,Okay. The boom in organic farming. Very hot topic right now.
00:37:37.881,00:37:39.382,"That's newsy, right?"
00:37:40.466,00:37:42.761,What do you want me to do? Fire another anchor?
00:37:42.844,00:37:45.471,Then we're gonna be stuck with that guy who counts with his hooves.
00:37:45.805,00:37:48.266,Colleen can't do every story that's not hard news.
00:37:48.349,00:37:50.476,It's Mike Pomeroy. He's a legend.
00:37:50.560,00:37:52.270,"-You know, what am I supposed to tell him? -There she is."
00:37:52.395,00:37:54.397,"What... Oh, hi."
00:37:54.606,00:37:56.775,"Interesting, Jerry hired you."
00:37:58.317,00:38:02.155,No polish. No pedigree. Those bangs.
00:38:09.537,00:38:10.496,Just wondering.
00:38:12.665,00:38:14.417,-He's a peach. -Yeah.
00:38:17.712,00:38:20.632,one of the most legendary newsmen of all time.
00:38:21.424,00:38:25.053,"Soon, he'll be bringing his experience to morning television."
00:38:25.344,00:38:30.809,Let Mike Pomeroy show you the world over your first cup of coffee!
00:38:30.892,00:38:33.603,"-For Christ's sake. -What? What, what, what is it now?"
00:38:33.686,00:38:36.773,"It's embarrassing. I mean, what's in the briefcase?"
00:38:36.856,00:38:38.858,-BECKY: What do you mean? -What? Special anchorman papers?
00:38:38.942,00:38:40.693,-It doesn't really matter. -My lunch? And where am I going?
00:38:40.777,00:38:42.570,-We've been over this eight times! -I'm running to nowhere.
00:38:42.654,00:38:45.406,"-I look like a jackass! -No... Yes, you do."
00:38:47.033,00:38:49.911,"You know, whoever gave you promo approval was smoking crack!"
00:38:49.995,00:38:53.539,-I want to meet that person. -I was mopping the floor -with Peter Jennings at the time. -I want to have words with...
00:38:53.623,00:38:55.583,I could have had hookers and eight balls written into my contract.
00:38:55.667,00:38:56.751,"Oh, how nice for you."
00:38:56.835,00:38:58.377,MAN: Over your first cup of coffee.
00:38:58.503,00:39:00.713,Why do we have to mention that first cup of coffee?
00:39:00.797,00:39:05.260,"Why not just say, Watch Mike Pomeroy before your morning dump?"
00:39:08.972,00:39:15.854,"BECKY: So for the fashion segments, I think it's important that we interpret runway trends for our viewers because they're not all 6-foot and Size 0."
00:39:16.813,00:39:18.356,"Man, he's cute."
00:39:18.690,00:39:20.317,-I went to Yale with him. -Shut up.
00:39:20.399,00:39:22.319,-You did not. -Everyone was madly in love with him.
00:39:22.735,00:39:25.030,"Actually, just me and every single person I knew."
00:39:25.113,00:39:27.282,-Can we just... -His dad was editor of Newsweek.
00:39:27.365,00:39:28.491,His mom's family is rich as hell.
00:39:28.574,00:39:30.202,They own like Tupperware or something.
00:39:30.285,00:39:32.954,He rowed crew for Yale when they won the national championship.
00:39:35.290,00:39:37.292,"Oh, hi."
00:39:41.379,00:39:42.421,You know him?
00:39:42.505,00:39:44.174,"No. Yeah, well, yes, I mean, I..."
00:39:45.591,00:39:47.219,-Yes. -Don't you think he's smokin'?
00:39:47.593,00:39:49.387,-Smokin'. -MAN: Yeah.
00:39:52.598,00:39:54.392,-MAN: Not a hard question. -WOMAN: He's walking away.
00:39:54.475,00:39:57.729,"So, jeans and belts."
00:40:17.456,00:40:20.459,"Well, you know, I asked him to do a piece on Trump."
00:40:20.710,00:40:24.381,And he actually picked up my Diet Coke and hurled it across the room.
00:40:24.463,00:40:27.133,"-Wow, he picked it up. -Just missed me. He did."
00:40:27.217,00:40:31.388,I asked him to cover a bumper crop of cranberries and he slapped me in the face.
00:40:32.638,00:40:34.391,-He did? -It's true.
00:40:34.766,00:40:36.768,"-Really? -Of course, he was drunk off his ass."
00:40:36.851,00:40:37.810,WOMAN: Adam!
00:40:38.186,00:40:40.063,"-Hi. -Oh, hi. How are you?"
00:40:40.146,00:40:41.189,I'm good.
00:40:42.399,00:40:44.609,-Hi. -You never called me!
00:40:44.692,00:40:45.777,"ADAM: Oh, I'm sorry."
00:40:45.860,00:40:48.863,"We, um... I was... I've been working a lot."
00:40:49.114,00:40:52.200,"Well, uh, maybe I'll see you at Barton's regatta party on Saturday."
00:40:52.284,00:40:53.910,"-ADAM: Great, great. -Okay, great."
00:40:53.993,00:40:55.120,"ADAM: Yeah, cool..."
00:40:55.203,00:40:56.162,Um...
00:40:56.704,00:40:58.039,"Sorry, I was just..."
00:40:58.123,00:40:59.624,"Oh, that's okay."
00:40:59.707,00:41:01.918,"Absolutely fine. That's fine, fine."
00:41:02.001,00:41:03.253,-Bye. -See you later.
00:41:06.756,00:41:07.799,Yeah.
00:41:08.507,00:41:22.147,"So, um, anyway, the reason that I came by tonight, was because I don't really know that many people who know Mike, and I thought, that, you know, I could get, uh, your professional feedback."
00:41:24.149,00:41:25.317,"Yeah, you know."
00:41:25.442,00:41:29.446,"I mean, 'cause I'm actually new in town and I don't..."
00:41:29.528,00:41:31.114,"-Oh, come on. -Oh, no, please."
00:41:31.364,00:41:33.658,"...have that many work contacts, so..."
00:41:34.075,00:41:38.079,Great. So we'll be contacts?
00:41:38.246,00:41:39.872,"Oh, that would be great."
00:41:40.706,00:41:42.459,"Well, you can never have enough of those."
00:41:44.710,00:41:47.255,"So, uh, definitely be seeing you around."
00:41:47.964,00:41:49.507,-Okay. -Okay.
00:41:59.351,00:42:00.435,Shit.
00:42:02.854,00:42:05.398,Okay. Good rehearsal. Good stuff.
00:42:05.482,00:42:09.361,"So, let's just alternate the voice-over intros of the headlines."
00:42:09.444,00:42:11.612,-Okay. -And then ad lib.
00:42:11.863,00:42:16.034,"So, let's say, for example, we're doing a story about, I don't know, uh, a midterm election."
00:42:16.117,00:42:17.160,But we won't.
00:42:17.452,00:42:19.620,Because the morning shows don't do news.
00:42:19.704,00:42:21.039,Pompous. That's really interesting.
00:42:21.122,00:42:22.665,That's a different color for you.
00:42:23.041,00:42:28.463,"That's... Okay, and you two should just sort of, you know, banter back and forth a little bit."
00:42:28.546,00:42:32.217,"Banter, from the Latin word, meaning to gibber like a moron?"
00:42:32.467,00:42:33.843,"Just, you know, talk about the headlines."
00:42:33.926,00:42:35.636,That's... That's what I mean.
00:42:36.804,00:42:39.516,I'm not gonna sit here and rehearse like I'm in summer stock.
00:42:39.598,00:42:41.767,"I've been on the air for 40 years, for Christ's sake."
00:42:41.851,00:42:43.728,I think I know how to ad lib.
00:42:45.771,00:42:49.734,The spill began when the tanker was damaged in heavy seas outside Galveston.
00:42:50.735,00:42:52.028,"Knock, knock."
00:42:52.278,00:42:53.779,Can I come in?
00:42:54.613,00:43:00.745,"Uh, I just, uh, wanted to say, you know, um, good luck."
00:43:02.497,00:43:04.207,Colleen's Pap smear.
00:43:06.084,00:43:07.668,A television classic.
00:43:09.379,00:43:11.172,Are you drunk?
00:43:11.756,00:43:13.299,Insufficiently.
00:43:14.675,00:43:17.678,Current weather conditions are complicating efforts to contain the...
00:43:17.762,00:43:19.222,That's my chair.
00:43:20.598,00:43:21.433,What?
00:43:21.516,00:43:24.561,That's where I belong. There.
00:43:25.061,00:43:26.645,Authorities have asked the federal government...
00:43:26.771,00:43:28.814,"Took it away from me, those mother..."
00:43:28.898,00:43:31.568,"I think maybe you should just you know, go home..."
00:43:31.650,00:43:32.485,See this?
00:43:32.569,00:43:33.861,Yes. What is that?
00:43:34.028,00:43:36.406,Forty-year-old Bruichladdich.
00:43:36.906,00:43:39.951,I only drink this when I'm practically suicidal.
00:43:40.659,00:43:41.953,"Uh, okay."
00:43:43.829,00:43:45.831,You're... You're very funny.
00:43:46.082,00:43:47.375,"Um, uh..."
00:43:47.833,00:43:50.711,"Well, I'm gonna see you tomorrow, right?"
00:44:21.742,00:44:22.701,-Hi. -Oh.
00:44:22.785,00:44:24.370,-Hi. -Hi.
00:44:24.454,00:44:26.456,"Hi. Um, I..."
00:44:26.831,00:44:30.168,Sorry. I thought that I might swing by to...
00:44:36.799,00:44:38.134,What are you working on?
00:44:38.717,00:44:39.718,Uh...
00:44:39.802,00:44:43.014,"Well, we're working on a piece on the communist rebels in the Philippines."
00:44:43.097,00:44:44.182,Good. That sounds great.
00:44:44.265,00:44:46.518,So I went to the bar the other night to see you.
00:44:46.601,00:44:49.479,"Yeah, I could tell. By the way you ran in the other direction."
00:44:49.562,00:44:51.397,Your arms pinwheeling.
00:44:56.611,00:44:58.530,"Yeah. Okay, fair, true."
00:45:00.865,00:45:05.537,I think that you're sort of comically great.
00:45:06.078,00:45:11.501,"And I thought it seemed so promising, so, um, I bungled it, because that's what I do. I bungle things."
00:45:11.584,00:45:18.383,"I bungle and I ramble, and that's kind of like what I'm doing right now, talking about it. You threw me off guard."
00:45:18.466,00:45:19.842,"You, with your..."
00:45:20.801,00:45:22.845,And the... And the... This...
00:45:22.928,00:45:23.888,And the...
00:45:25.598,00:45:27.850,My working on a loom?
00:45:27.933,00:45:29.352,-My... -No.
00:45:29.435,00:45:32.063,My double-handed craps. My...
00:45:33.314,00:45:35.400,-I... -My Jazzercise.
00:45:35.774,00:45:37.402,Rowing. Rowing.
00:45:37.485,00:45:39.153,-Rowing? -Championship?
00:45:39.237,00:45:40.363,I never would have got that.
00:45:42.823,00:45:44.033,But you know what I mean.
00:45:44.116,00:45:45.910,That I didn't think that you...
00:45:47.620,00:45:48.705,Liked me.
00:45:49.872,00:45:51.708,But I do. Oddly.
00:45:53.000,00:45:54.502,You're... Different.
00:45:56.003,00:45:57.380,And a deeply terrible mime.
00:45:58.797,00:46:03.302,"Well, I asked you out. Then when I saw you at the bar, I practically tackled you to the ground."
00:46:03.386,00:46:04.761,What part of that was confusing?
00:46:04.845,00:46:06.763,"Here, here, here, sit down."
00:46:07.265,00:46:10.893,"Look, my radar for that kind of thing is so bad."
00:46:10.976,00:46:14.813,"I mean, I don't know if a man's interested in me until he's naked."
00:46:14.897,00:46:20.612,"I mean, the pants come off and then I'm like, oh, I guess you don't really want to see my CD collection or talk about Kerouac."
00:46:21.654,00:46:22.905,You're nuts.
00:46:25.450,00:46:26.284,"Okay, look."
00:46:28.160,00:46:29.036,Let's start over.
00:46:29.537,00:46:32.665,Let's go out to dinner like regular people.
00:46:32.749,00:46:35.334,"Just take it slowly, just see where it leads."
00:46:35.418,00:46:36.377,How does that sound?
00:46:38.003,00:46:40.131,That sounds perfect.
00:46:45.762,00:46:47.930,"-Oh, God, I should go home. -Mmm-hmm."
00:46:48.889,00:46:50.600,"Oh, it's 8:00! It's 8:00 already."
00:46:50.683,00:46:51.684,I know.
00:46:52.101,00:46:53.852,It's Mike's first day tomorrow.
00:46:54.646,00:46:56.355,-You should definitely go. -What's the big whoop?
00:46:56.439,00:46:59.191,"I mean, you know, he's done this like a million times before."
00:46:59.275,00:47:01.402,-Yeah. -And he knows exactly what he's doing.
00:47:01.486,00:47:02.528,-Yeah. -So...
00:47:03.404,00:47:04.781,"-It's fine. -Uh, mmm-hmm."
00:47:09.577,00:47:12.204,"He didn't open a bottle of 40-year-old Bruichladdich, did he?"
00:47:13.414,00:47:14.457,How do you know that?
00:47:19.462,00:47:31.223,"When I was working with him, if there was something that he didn't want to do, the Oscars, the Olympics, something that people might actually get a tiny twinge of pleasure from, the night before he would go on a bender."
00:47:31.599,00:47:33.601,Call in sick for work the next day.
00:47:35.520,00:47:38.897,"No. No, no. This is ridiculous. I'm not..."
00:47:39.064,00:47:41.275,I'm not going out there and chasing him around.
00:47:41.359,00:47:44.654,"If he wants to screw this up, that is his problem."
00:47:49.033,00:47:49.866,Start at Elaine's.
00:47:49.950,00:47:51.285,"Oh, God, thank you. Thank you."
00:47:53.412,00:47:54.580,I'm so sorry.
00:47:55.581,00:47:57.208,We'll do it again sometime.
00:48:05.924,00:48:07.009,Thanks.
00:48:09.428,00:48:10.805,-Pomeroy? -Yeah.
00:48:10.887,00:48:13.057,He was here. He left about an hour ago.
00:48:43.337,00:48:45.339,"Oh, no. The little woman."
00:48:46.173,00:48:47.258,Incoming.
00:48:47.341,00:48:50.135,"Jesus Christ, Pomeroy, they're getting younger and younger."
00:48:52.929,00:48:55.433,"Mike, I need to talk to you."
00:48:55.641,00:48:58.477,Why? Is the baby mine?
00:48:59.896,00:49:07.278,"I will have you know that this show is very important to a lot of people, including but not limited to me. My ass is on the line here."
00:49:08.195,00:49:11.198,"-Actually, your ass is irrelevant. -Oh."
00:49:11.282,00:49:17.872,"You're just a footnote. It's my ass, my reputation, my integrity, mine!"
00:49:17.954,00:49:20.708,"Mine! You're such an egotistical, selfish person!"
00:49:20.792,00:49:22.376,I'm on-air talent!
00:49:22.460,00:49:23.294,Oh!
00:49:26.881,00:49:28.006,Get in.
00:49:29.759,00:49:30.676,Hey!
00:49:35.347,00:49:37.600,"Okay, I'm home. You can leave."
00:49:37.683,00:49:39.936,No. No.
00:49:44.356,00:49:45.357,Wow.
00:49:53.365,00:49:54.492,"Oh, my God."
00:49:59.413,00:50:00.414,Is that a real...
00:50:01.540,00:50:02.458,Of course.
00:50:12.885,00:50:14.637,"You're alone tonight, huh?"
00:50:15.137,00:50:16.054,Uh.
00:50:17.055,00:50:18.265,Makes sense.
00:50:20.225,00:50:21.310,Let me guess.
00:50:24.020,00:50:25.606,You meet a guy.
00:50:25.857,00:50:27.650,You have about three dates.
00:50:28.609,00:50:31.278,Spend the whole time talking about your job.
00:50:32.488,00:50:34.323,He loses your phone number.
00:50:38.452,00:50:43.081,"Aside from your obvious father issues, what'd he do?"
00:50:43.875,00:50:45.835,Leave you? Die?
00:50:46.210,00:50:50.130,You've got this repellent moxie.
00:50:50.214,00:50:52.800,Look at all the stories you could be doing here.
00:50:53.133,00:50:56.554,About art and hunting and fishing.
00:50:57.304,00:51:00.016,"I mean, you have grandchildren."
00:51:00.098,00:51:02.894,I didn't even know you had kids.
00:51:03.644,00:51:05.688,"Look, we could be doing parenting segments."
00:51:05.771,00:51:09.025,"-You should invite them down to the show. -Oh, right."
00:51:09.901,00:51:12.110,The ungrateful little bastards.
00:51:12.444,00:51:13.487,I don't think so.
00:51:14.446,00:51:16.281,"Well, the little tour's over."
00:51:17.783,00:51:19.952,Time to go back to your sad little life.
00:51:20.745,00:51:23.581,I'm not going anywhere until we are on the air.
00:51:23.664,00:51:26.082,"Well, please don't snore. I'm a light sleeper."
00:51:26.166,00:51:27.626,I'm not going to be sleeping.
00:51:42.391,00:51:44.018,-Good night. -Good night.
00:52:36.361,00:52:37.195,Oh!
00:52:42.534,00:52:43.828,"Let's go, girl."
00:52:53.211,00:52:54.212,What are you doing?
00:52:54.296,00:52:56.090,Have you ever seen a real egg?
00:52:56.548,00:52:59.301,These are from pastured hens in Maryland.
00:52:59.384,00:53:00.970,We have to go.
00:53:01.345,00:53:03.931,I have them delivered once a week.
00:53:04.180,00:53:05.474,We have to go.
00:53:06.142,00:53:11.730,"Now, the beauty of a frittata is that it can be made with any ingredient."

01:04:00.587,01:04:02.464,"Oh, my God! It's you, you're that guy!"
01:04:02.547,01:04:07.010,"I just saw you this morning and everyone was eating stuffed zucchini, and you were all cranky about it."
01:04:07.093,01:04:08.679,"I was like, Oh, my God, there's that guy!"
01:04:08.762,01:04:11.848,"You used to do news, right? Like a while ago? It's... Oh..."
01:04:12.265,01:04:14.768,"Please, remove your hand from my person."
01:04:14.851,01:04:16.394,"-Thank you. -Oh, this is great!"
01:04:16.478,01:04:19.564,Thank you! I can't believe it! Dan Rather!
01:04:20.440,01:04:21.274,Dan Rather!
01:04:21.358,01:04:23.485,See? People want to like you.
01:04:23.568,01:04:30.450,"You're, uh... You're in their home every day, and, you know, it's an honor and, you know, why can't you just do stories people might enjoy?"
01:04:31.117,01:04:31.993,Mike...
01:04:33.036,01:04:34.912,We're in trouble. I'm in trouble.
01:04:34.996,01:04:36.289,"Help me, please."
01:04:39.501,01:04:42.003,Dan Rather. For Christ's sake.
01:04:42.713,01:04:44.756,Becky! Becky!
01:04:47.050,01:04:49.720,I have a great idea for a segment. Get ready for this.
01:04:50.637,01:04:51.680,Past lives.
01:04:51.971,01:04:57.227,"If we could find out who celebrities had been in their past lives, I think that would be terrific, don't you?"
01:04:57.310,01:05:02.065,"I mean, what if Justin Timberlake had been Abraham Lincoln?"
01:05:03.692,01:05:07.404,Many actors have changed their names to be taken more seriously.
01:05:07.738,01:05:09.656,Ricky Schroder became Rick.
01:05:09.989,01:05:12.200,The Rock became Dwayne Johnson.
01:05:12.283,01:05:19.875,"And Portia de Rossi's name used to be Amanda, but she changed it so as to sound more like the car, which she felt sounded more impressorial."
01:05:20.083,01:05:25.589,"A new name has become the latest, hottest accessory for celebrities, like a Birkin bag or a baby."
01:05:25.922,01:05:28.091,"Back to you, Mike, or Michael."
01:05:28.174,01:05:29.967,MAN: Dissolve to Mike and ticker in.
01:05:30.051,01:05:31.553,How did she get here?
01:05:32.262,01:05:33.221,Don't ask.
01:05:33.471,01:05:35.390,What? Is she sleeping with someone?
01:05:37.809,01:05:38.685,Pardon me?
01:05:40.186,01:05:41.020,Thanks.
01:05:51.989,01:05:52.908,Have you seen these?
01:05:54.158,01:05:55.201,"Yes, but..."
01:05:55.285,01:05:56.369,You want to make the ratings worse?
01:05:56.453,01:05:57.454,That's why you came here?
01:05:57.579,01:05:59.330,"Well, no."
01:05:59.497,01:06:02.125,Mike is still getting up to speed.
01:06:02.208,01:06:04.210,-I'm still working on a couple elements. -Getting Mike up to speed?
01:06:04.294,01:06:06.421,-Yeah. -You're circling the drain.
01:06:06.630,01:06:09.883,You rarely book anybody decent because of the ratings.
01:06:09.966,01:06:11.092,You're not getting any big interviews.
01:06:11.175,01:06:12.093,We just need more time.
01:06:13.136,01:06:14.137,Just a little...
01:06:14.220,01:06:17.599,"God, you're... You're more naive than I thought, aren't you?"
01:06:19.225,01:06:20.226,Excuse me?
01:06:20.435,01:06:22.437,The network wants to cancel the show.
01:06:24.355,01:06:28.234,They want to run game shows and syndicated talk instead.
01:06:30.403,01:06:37.076,"For a second, I thought you might have a shot, especially when you got Pomeroy. But the joke's on me, 'cause it turns out you failed even more completely than the network could have thought."
01:06:37.160,01:06:39.162,"In six weeks, they cancel the show."
01:06:39.245,01:06:43.875,"So, not only will you have significantly weakened our news division, -you will have presided over the demise of a show... -No, no, no..."
01:06:43.959,01:06:45.543,...that's been on the air for 47 years! Nice work.
01:06:45.627,01:06:48.797,Why don't you go over to PBS and see if you can kill Sesame Street?
01:06:53.468,01:06:55.178,Go. You've wasted enough of my time.
01:06:57.514,01:07:00.517,We have six weeks. Can you just not tell anyone yet?
01:07:00.600,01:07:02.894,Because morale isn't exactly at a peak.
01:07:02.978,01:07:04.187,Fine. Tell 'em when you want to.
01:07:04.270,01:07:05.730,"It doesn't really matter, does it?"
01:07:07.774,01:07:10.026,"Piper, get Phil Griffin on the phone."
01:07:10.109,01:07:13.947,"Tell him if I don't hear from him by 5:00, those Super Bowl tickets go to Phyllis McGrady!"
01:07:17.742,01:07:22.706,NEWSCASTER 2: It certainly is a happy day here on Lincoln Road between Bedford Avenue and Rogers Avenue.
01:07:22.789,01:07:24.708,"This is, yes, official..."
01:07:32.256,01:07:33.675,"-MAN: We're live at 5:00, people. -Okay."
01:07:33.758,01:07:37.094,"Feathery, fleecy, flocculent?"
01:07:37.178,01:07:39.305,"Oh, for Christ's sake."
01:07:39.389,01:07:41.391,What? What's going on now?
01:07:41.474,01:07:43.810,Mike is offended by a word in the next story.
01:07:44.435,01:07:47.146,He's offended. It's about Easter chicks.
01:07:47.230,01:07:48.940,I'm not saying the word fluffy.
01:07:49.024,01:07:51.526,It's bad enough I have to do these ridiculous stories.
01:07:51.693,01:07:53.152,"Hey, you know what, buddy? Guess what?"
01:07:53.236,01:07:57.032,"Last week, I had to use the words rectal and moisture in the same sentence."
01:07:57.114,01:07:58.324,"Well, first dates can be awkward."
01:08:00.577,01:08:01.661,-Becky... -That's it!
01:08:01.745,01:08:04.039,"-Becky, Becky, what are you doing? -I've had enough!"
01:08:05.707,01:08:07.709,Mike? I need to talk to you.
01:08:07.792,01:08:09.085,"Becky, we're back in 60."
01:08:09.168,01:08:10.420,"I'm sorry, this'll just take a second."
01:08:11.546,01:08:13.882,I've looked up to you all my life.
01:08:14.632,01:08:16.634,You know that? I actually idolized you.
01:08:16.718,01:08:18.344,My dad and I used to watch you on TV.
01:08:18.678,01:08:25.268,"So just, you know, imagine my surprise when it turns out that you're actually the worst person in the entire world."
01:08:25.476,01:08:27.938,Not the third worst! The worst!
01:08:28.021,01:08:29.146,What's going on?
01:08:29.856,01:08:32.859,Pomeroy. He broke the latest Daybreak EP.
01:08:32.943,01:08:36.863,"...how lucky we all are to have these jobs, -how quickly that can be taken away. -PRODUCER: We're back in..."
01:08:36.947,01:08:42.994,"And there's this guy, this really kind of great, smokin' guy who can actually stand me long enough to have sex with me."
01:08:44.662,01:08:46.581,BECKY: And you know what? It's all just a big mess.
01:08:46.664,01:08:48.249,-Because of you! -Five...
01:08:48.332,01:08:54.547,"You know, nobody can do their jobs well around here, because you can't be bothered to do yours at all!"
01:08:54.631,01:08:55.840,WOMAN: And we're back.
01:08:59.343,01:09:03.681,"Welcome back to Daybreak. And now, with a check of the weather, here's Ernie."
01:09:03.765,01:09:04.724,Take Ernie on the plaza.
01:09:04.808,01:09:05.850,"Thanks, Colleen."
01:09:05.934,01:09:08.352,"Surprisingly toasty day out here, isn't it, folks?"
01:09:11.731,01:09:13.483,Good day to break out the bikini.
01:09:16.235,01:09:18.947,"All right. Well, what do we have here?"
01:09:20.115,01:09:21.783,"Goodness, honey. I did not put her up to this."
01:09:21.866,01:09:23.284,"Becky, coke? Diet Coke?"
01:09:23.367,01:09:25.120,"No, I don't want a Diet Coke, thank you. Step aside!"
01:09:28.748,01:09:31.084,"Jerry, I would like to talk to you."
01:09:31.167,01:09:33.044,Now you're gonna bust a cap in my ass?
01:09:33.128,01:09:34.545,What if I get the ratings up?
01:09:37.298,01:09:39.092,What if I move that needle just enough?
01:09:39.175,01:09:40.051,You won't.
01:09:40.135,01:09:41.469,"We'll, you're... You don't know that."
01:09:41.552,01:09:46.474,"-Becky. -There's got to be some number I can hit that will give us a shot, that would give us an extra six months, something."
01:09:46.557,01:09:50.103,"Oh, sure, if you got over 1.5 -or something absurd like that... -Done!"
01:09:50.728,01:09:51.855,So I've got your word?
01:09:51.980,01:09:55.942,"I get those ratings up more than three quarters of a point, -you give me more time? -It won't happen."
01:09:59.487,01:10:02.281,"Oh, and your girlfriend Lisa?"
01:10:02.740,01:10:04.951,Can you get her a dictionary and stick her on somebody else's show?
01:10:05.035,01:10:06.410,'Cause she's killing me.
01:10:10.874,01:10:14.251,"Wow, well, look who the wind blew in! What happened to you?"
01:10:14.377,01:10:16.420,"Well, we're gonna change a few things."
01:10:17.172,01:10:18.965,-Okay. -Is Ernie in place?
01:10:19.174,01:10:22.468,"Yes, he is. He'll be interviewing people as they come off the coaster."
01:10:22.552,01:10:24.971,"No, he won't. Not anymore, he's not."
01:10:25.055,01:10:26.514,We're gonna put him on that coaster.
01:10:26.639,01:10:30.143,We're gonna strap a handheld to the car in front of him and then go live. Boom.
01:10:30.560,01:10:32.687,"It's called picking up the game, people. Okay?"
01:10:32.770,01:10:36.774,"So from now on, every single story that we do, it's gonna have to be sensational!"
01:10:37.108,01:10:38.484,We're gonna be more aggressive.
01:10:38.568,01:10:40.653,We're gonna work harder. And we're gonna do it right now.
01:10:42.655,01:10:44.908,-Are you gonna... -I'm not gonna sing!
01:10:45.575,01:10:47.035,Why do people ask me that?
01:10:47.118,01:10:50.205,"So the big question is, are we gonna be able to hear his mic?"
01:10:50.413,01:10:51.497,"Yes, we will."
01:10:52.373,01:10:56.419,"If he has a heart attack, we'll be able to capture every heartrending scream."
01:10:58.838,01:10:59.672,Cue her.
01:10:59.756,01:11:05.095,Thrill-seekers have something to look forward to this summer as Six Flags unveils a brand-new roller coaster.
01:11:05.261,01:11:10.307,The Manhandler is the fastest coaster in the US with speeds up to 130 miles an hour...
01:11:10.391,01:11:11.726,Stand Ernie by. Here we go.
01:11:11.809,01:11:13.728,...in an angle of descent at 95 degrees.
01:11:14.145,01:11:19.150,"Our own Ernie Appleby is getting a sneak peek at this amazing new ride. Isn't that right, Ernie?"
01:11:19.358,01:11:21.236,MALE PRODUCER: Standing by. Open his mic. Open his mic.
01:11:21.318,01:11:23.780,"-COLLEEN: Ernie, can you hear us? -Yes. Yes, I can."
01:11:23.905,01:11:26.116,"And so far, it's a beautiful ride."
01:11:26.407,01:11:29.202,"Uh, quite an amazing view from up here."
01:11:29.368,01:11:33.998,"Mostly blue skies. Cumulus clouds on the horizon, always a good sign this time of year."
01:11:34.624,01:11:36.459,"Ooh, might be heading into our first dip."
01:11:37.418,01:11:41.756,"Oh, my. Oh, my."
01:11:57.021,01:11:59.816,"Oh, yeah. No, this is a great idea."
01:12:07.115,01:12:08.283,"ERNIE: Please, make it stop!"
01:12:12.912,01:12:13.997,What are you gonna do to him next?
01:12:14.080,01:12:15.873,Strap electrodes to his balls?
01:12:16.373,01:12:20.419,I actually felt sorry for that animatronic puppet asshole.
01:12:20.503,01:12:23.380,"Hey, look, we got 80,000 hits on YouTube already."
01:12:23.464,01:12:25.091,And Ernie is absolutely thrilled.
01:12:25.175,01:12:27.802,"Oh, and by the way, we got another bump in the minute-to-minutes."
01:12:27.885,01:12:29.637,"-Becky, good stuff. -Thank you!"
01:12:29.971,01:12:31.514,"Lighten up, Mike."
01:12:31.597,01:12:32.807,You know what I've noticed?
01:12:32.890,01:12:36.686,"People only say Lighten up, when they're gonna stick their fist up your ass."
01:12:36.769,01:12:39.189,"Well, you know what? I hate to break it to you, but the fact is..."
01:12:39.272,01:12:41.316,"-Oh, my God, amazing segment. -Thank you."
01:12:41.398,01:12:46.154,The world has been debating news versus entertainment for years and guess what?
01:12:46.237,01:12:48.531,"-Mike, your side lost. -You know what?"
01:12:49.532,01:12:50.366,What?
01:12:51.450,01:12:54.620,You're wrong. People are smart.
01:12:54.704,01:12:56.122,They want information.
01:12:56.206,01:12:58.582,"Not junk, which is all you're willing to give them."
01:12:58.875,01:13:01.336,"Junk. Sugar, sugar, sugar."
01:13:01.418,01:13:02.879,"-Excuse me. -Oh, okay."
01:13:02.962,01:13:03.921,And more sugar.
01:13:04.005,01:13:06.382,"Yeah, well, what would you have them do, Mike?"
01:13:06.465,01:13:10.303,"Uh... Ooh, ooh, eat bran all day?"
01:13:10.386,01:13:12.055,"Fiber, fiber, fiber?"
01:13:12.680,01:13:18.895,"We have to get the ratings up, Mike, or we can have a lot of high-minded ideas and not be on the air."
01:13:20.396,01:13:23.524,"This show may go down, but it's not because I'm not trying my hardest."
01:13:23.607,01:13:28.071,"You hear me? I don't care what you do, but I'm not giving up."
01:13:31.991,01:13:34.618,I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to you right now about Ernie.
01:13:35.078,01:13:36.204,"Oh, my God, you, too?"
01:13:36.287,01:13:37.538,-Yes. -Why is everyone worried about Ernie?
01:13:37.621,01:13:39.082,"-You know, he's a grown man. -Worried about Ernie?"
01:13:39.165,01:13:40.583,-Are you kidding me? -He signed release forms.
01:13:40.666,01:13:43.378,"He's a hack. Look, I see what you're doing."
01:13:43.460,01:13:48.549,"I think it's great. It's exactly what I've been waiting for, so just, you know, sign me up, Coach. Put me in."
01:13:48.632,01:13:50.426,"-Whatever you want to call it, all right? -Really?"
01:13:50.509,01:13:51.344,Yeah.
01:13:52.845,01:13:55.014,Do you have any preexisting conditions?
01:14:08.444,01:14:09.486,Would you like to hold him?
01:14:12.323,01:14:13.532,Watch it. Careful he doesn't go in there.
01:14:13.616,01:14:15.159,"No. Ah! Can you get it out, though?"
01:14:16.869,01:14:18.955,Mike wanted to be here for this. Mike Pomeroy.
01:14:24.877,01:14:25.836,BOTH: Oh...
01:14:43.313,01:14:45.773,Those are frog lips. Does a frog open its lips ever?
01:14:45.856,01:14:47.900,"Ready four, take four. Ready one. Take one."
01:14:48.734,01:14:50.861,-I'm just kidding. I would never do that. -Ready one. Take it.
01:14:52.029,01:14:54.031,"How about a big kiss, sucker?"
01:14:54.407,01:14:55.450,"Mmm, mmm."
01:14:59.662,01:15:01.289,That's a little... That's wrong.
01:15:03.624,01:15:05.376,That was so good. Do it again.
01:15:11.674,01:15:15.636,"Fiddy, Fiddy! Mr. Cent? Hi! Uh, fan. Big fan!"
01:15:18.806,01:15:22.226,"Um, I'm a producer for Daybreak and we would so love to have you on our show."

01:26:58.296,01:27:01.383,"That was better than a great story, that was great television."
01:27:01.466,01:27:05.261,"I mean, that was bran with a donut."
01:27:05.470,01:27:06.638,A bran donut.

01:27:38.837,01:27:40.047,"The truth is, I'd..."
01:27:40.923,01:27:45.510,I'd screwed up with my kids way before I got canned.
01:27:47.888,01:27:57.606,"Anyway, I was never at home and when I was, I took every phone call, watching TV out of the corner of my eye."
01:28:00.567,01:28:01.985,Why am I telling you this?
01:28:02.903,01:28:04.071,You're worse than I am.
01:28:05.655,01:28:07.950,"You'd sleep at the office, if you could."
01:28:13.329,01:28:15.165,Let me tell you how it turns out.
01:28:17.333,01:28:19.711,You end up with... With nothing.
01:28:21.379,01:28:22.214,Nothing.
01:28:26.426,01:28:27.343,Which is...
01:28:28.470,01:28:32.641,Which is what I had till you came along.
01:28:42.943,01:28:44.987,Did you just say something nice to me?
01:28:47.156,01:28:49.116,I told you I could banter.
01:29:23.317,01:29:27.154,"They're not, uh, awful."
01:29:28.822,01:29:30.157,How much longer can we get?
01:29:30.448,01:29:37.247,"Well, I have to check with upstairs, but with these I can get you a year, a comfortable year."
01:29:38.915,01:29:40.625,"I underestimated you, Becky."
01:29:41.918,01:29:44.171,"Oh, that's... That's very, very true."
01:29:45.672,01:29:46.840,NBC called.
01:29:49.134,01:29:50.093,NBC?
01:29:51.345,01:29:53.387,Wanted to know how much time you have on your contract.
01:29:58.185,01:29:59.602,The Today Show wants you.
01:30:06.276,01:30:08.402,"Well, that's very flattering. I..."
01:30:12.991,01:30:13.992,Is that what you want?
01:30:45.899,01:30:47.359,They were gonna cancel the show.
01:30:49.111,01:30:50.444,-Okay. -Yeah.
01:30:54.157,01:31:01.415,"And, you know, the thing is, is that the second I knew that everything was gonna be okay, the person that I wanted to tell was you."
01:31:04.584,01:31:07.212,The Today Show? That's huge.
01:31:12.384,01:31:14.344,But I have to think about it. I...
01:31:14.928,01:31:15.762,What?
01:31:15.845,01:31:17.139,"Well, yeah, I mean, I..."
01:31:17.680,01:31:21.810,"Well, the thing is, is that at Daybreak, everyone's really starting to click."
01:31:21.893,01:31:24.104,"You know, everybody's pitching in and doing what they're best at."
01:31:24.187,01:31:25.521,No story too high or too low.
01:31:25.605,01:31:27.607,"No, hold on, you can't say no to this."
01:31:27.690,01:31:30.526,"When you get an opportunity like this, you have to grab it."
01:31:30.610,01:31:32.486,Even Mike is almost happy.
01:31:32.570,01:31:35.698,And that's a good enough reason to give up the best job in broadcasting?
01:31:36.532,01:31:37.367,We're...
01:31:38.785,01:31:41.871,Daybreak is a family now.
01:31:43.790,01:31:46.001,"Becky, I've known Mike a long time."
01:31:46.751,01:31:49.129,I... It doesn't matter how happy he is.
01:31:49.212,01:31:52.007,He's not just gonna suddenly change into a different person.
01:31:52.299,01:31:53.507,"Well, I think you're wrong."
01:31:54.843,01:31:57.053,I know what I'm doing with him now.
01:31:57.471,01:32:00.556,I do. I do.
01:32:02.142,01:32:03.477,It's gonna be great.
01:32:06.104,01:32:09.523,"So we've got the Supreme Court Justice hearings at the top of the hour and then, um..."
01:32:09.607,01:32:13.320,"Ooh, I forgot to tell you, Anthony Bourdain wants to do a segment with you!"
01:32:13.611,01:32:16.198,Bourdain? Love him. Not doing that.
01:32:16.530,01:32:19.075,But say hi to Tony. I owe him a bottle of Patron.
01:32:20.076,01:32:21.911,"-Um, what... -What?"
01:32:22.245,01:32:25.332,We do one good story together and suddenly I'm your bitch?
01:32:25.499,01:32:26.958,Don't think so. Sorry.
01:32:28.043,01:32:29.211,"Wait. Wait, wait, wait."
01:32:29.752,01:32:31.963,You can't do one story for me?
01:32:32.714,01:32:34.632,"Oh, my God, what is wrong with me?"
01:32:34.716,01:32:37.010,"What am I doing here, beating my head against this wall?"
01:32:37.093,01:32:40.263,"I might as well go to The Today Show, where you don't have to poke Matt Lauer with a stick..."
01:32:40.347,01:32:41.473,The Today Show?
01:32:42.182,01:32:44.309,"-Yes, they offered me a job. -Of course."
01:32:44.476,01:32:45.559,But you know what? I said...
01:32:45.643,01:32:46.978,Time to move on.
01:32:47.062,01:32:48.313,You'll love The Today Show.
01:32:48.397,01:32:51.525,You and Vieira can do menopause stories every week!
01:32:51.607,01:32:53.026,You know what's really ridiculous?
01:32:53.902,01:32:58.990,"Is that until about 10 seconds ago, I'd actually considered turning my back on the best job I've ever been offered."
01:32:59.074,01:33:01.117,Isn't that totally absurd?
01:33:02.869,01:33:04.037,What's keeping you?
01:33:06.164,01:33:06.998,Okay.
01:33:07.707,01:33:15.882,"You know, if you'd ever treated me with some kind of friendship or loyalty, or trust, these things that you seem incapable of..."
01:33:15.965,01:33:19.719,"You miserable, lonely, egotistical, selfish asshole!"
01:33:45.745,01:33:48.290,They called again. The Today Show.
01:33:50.125,01:33:50.959,Thanks.
01:34:52.521,01:34:53.813,"Uh, Becky Fuller."
01:34:54.481,01:35:02.572,"Obviously, we have a long track record of success here at The Today Show, -but we're always looking to stay current... -Mmm-hmm."
01:35:02.656,01:35:08.744,"...to get out of our comfort zone, and, um, we want the show to have that youthful energy."
01:35:08.828,01:35:12.415,And we are so impressed with what you have done with Daybreak.
01:35:12.748,01:35:16.710,"Oh, well, thank you very much. I appreciate it."
01:35:17.587,01:35:20.048,Everyone is talking about it. You must know that.
01:35:20.256,01:35:25.470,"I mean, you have done an amazing job of revitalizing a show that many people had just completely written off."
01:35:26.179,01:35:28.473,"Well, thank you. Thanks."
01:35:28.722,01:35:29.891,And we're out!
01:35:34.103,01:35:35.146,They're gonna hire her.
01:35:35.938,01:35:38.983,"Yeah. She's at The Today Show right now, ding-dong."
01:35:39.192,01:35:43.697,"Do you have any idea, you know, what you've done here?"
01:35:43.779,01:35:52.581,"Because we had a decent producer, a decent show and, God forbid, anyone around here should be happy, but you had to have this happen, didn't you?"
01:35:53.665,01:35:54.874,"All right, stand by, folks. Here we go."
01:35:54.957,01:35:57.252,"MALE PRODUCER 1: Three, two, one."
01:35:57.335,01:36:00.296,MALE PRODUCER 2: And dissolve two. And cue 'em! Cue 'em!
01:36:01.172,01:36:02.382,Welcome back to Daybreak.
01:36:02.465,01:36:04.008,Uh-oh. What is wrong?
01:36:04.092,01:36:05.635,A look at the nation's crumbling infrastructure.
01:36:05.801,01:36:07.303,"Go to Colleen. Jesus, jump off Mike."
01:36:07.387,01:36:08.804,"-Where the hell is he going? -Take three, three."
01:36:09.514,01:36:11.849,"Cue over to three. Swing her to three, please."
01:36:11.933,01:36:13.476,"Come on, Jane, over to three."
01:36:13.935,01:36:19.148,"Sorry, the... This segment's usually a two-shot of Mike and Colleen and Mike's not there."
01:36:19.982,01:36:22.985,"Uh, they've probably just changed something. Sorry."
01:36:25.113,01:36:26.281,I don't know. Where is Mike?
01:36:28.450,01:36:30.243,-I need eggs. -You need what?
01:36:30.619,01:36:32.245,"You know, from chickens. Eggs!"
01:36:35.164,01:36:37.083,Really don't enjoy this job.
01:36:37.959,01:36:39.753,"Chinese people, move, move, move!"
01:36:41.254,01:36:42.464,Thank you!
01:36:44.215,01:36:46.800,Celery. Peppers. Cheese. Cheese.
01:36:49.471,01:36:51.389,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
01:36:51.598,01:36:53.057,"Yeah, thank you very much."
01:36:54.684,01:36:57.061,We wanted to know what your plans are for sports coverage.
01:36:57.145,01:37:00.189,"Oh, sports. Great, okay. Uh, great."
01:37:03.901,01:37:06.028,"Come on, move, move! Let's go, let's go!"
01:37:07.113,01:37:08.906,"WOMAN: Mike, tell us what you need."
01:37:09.658,01:37:14.078,"I need a cutting board, good knife, nice plate, bowl, whisk."
01:37:14.287,01:37:16.790,"What is this, rubber? Get me a real bowl."
01:37:17.081,01:37:18.249,-Where are my eggs? -Cue over to three.
01:37:19.041,01:37:20.126,Where are my goddamn eggs?
01:37:20.209,01:37:21.628,"Eggs for Mike, please!"
01:37:21.711,01:37:30.470,"In respect to sports, I think that it's really important to reach out to women through their kids, because, you know, it's not that big of a step to go from being a soccer mom to, you know..."
01:37:32.555,01:37:34.056,"Oh, my God. What is he doing?"
01:37:38.311,01:37:39.604,"Sorry, I just..."
01:37:40.104,01:37:43.941,This is... Mike Pomeroy is having a nervous breakdown on air.
01:37:44.025,01:37:45.527,That's kind of big news.
01:37:45.610,01:37:52.701,"A meal for their afternoon repast, something they could make using whatever ingredients they had available."
01:37:52.826,01:37:54.160,Holy shit.
01:37:54.744,01:38:09.133,"I've been making frittata for about 20 years now, ever since I was taught how to, on a naked weekend with a beautiful Italian movie star, who shall, of course, remain nameless."
01:38:09.925,01:38:11.720,"MIKE: Occasionally, I make them at home."
01:38:13.513,01:38:15.348,But only for people that I...
01:38:16.850,01:38:18.309,People I really care about.
01:38:20.353,01:38:31.364,"Now, the key to a great frittata is a very hot pan, because that, my friends, is what makes it..."
01:38:33.074,01:38:34.158,fluffy.
01:38:39.789,01:38:40.749,...green herbs...
01:38:40.832,01:38:41.666,"Oh, oh..."
01:38:42.584,01:38:44.753,-...dash of pepper... -I'm sorry. I...
01:38:47.255,01:38:48.464,You watching this?
01:38:51.634,01:38:54.846,"-Becky? -Yes, I... Yeah."
01:38:55.680,01:38:57.473,He is not gonna ask you twice.
01:38:57.557,01:39:00.560,"We'll give it a few seconds, then we'll pop it in the hot oven."
01:39:02.437,01:39:03.730,Bye! Thanks!
01:39:12.447,01:39:13.489,A little pepper.
01:39:24.958,01:39:26.795,Stand by. He's going back to the oven. Ready three.
01:39:36.387,01:39:38.932,A lot of people like a glass of di Gavi.
01:39:39.724,01:39:41.350,"Gavi di Gavi, perhaps."
01:39:42.101,01:39:45.354,"I, myself, like a Barolo."
01:39:54.029,01:39:55.531,I'll just free up the edges.
01:40:20.348,01:40:31.275,"Next week on the show, I'll show you how to make a fantastic beignet, which the rabble like to call donuts."
01:40:36.698,01:40:37.949,The old bastard.
01:40:41.118,01:40:44.539,"You know, he's still the third worst person in the world."
01:40:47.583,01:40:48.835,"Yeah, I know."
01:40:53.255,01:40:54.298,That's good.
01:40:57.176,01:40:58.427,That's really good.
01:40:59.888,01:41:02.306,I want a tropical fruit plate.
01:42:04.159,01:42:11.793,"BECKY: His gravity leavens the silliness of morning TV, making for an incongruous but somehow perfect match."
01:42:12.251,01:42:18.007,"Turns out that after 40 years in the business, the real Mike Pomeroy has finally arrived."
01:42:18.215,01:42:19.216,Not bad.
01:42:19.425,01:42:22.386,"MIKE: By the way, I'm getting my prostate checked next week."
01:42:22.470,01:42:24.388,I thought I'd take a crew with me.
01:42:26.099,01:42:27.642,"Jesus, I'm kidding."
01:42:27.725,01:42:32.855,"No, seriously, they have these little teeny, tiny cameras -that go right up your... -No, no, no."
01:42:32.939,01:42:34.816,What if we got you a body double?
01:42:37.068,01:42:38.319,-No! -No?
01:42:38.402,01:42:40.237,Not in a thousand years.
