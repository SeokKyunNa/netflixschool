00:04:26.766,00:04:27.934,How are you feeling?
00:04:28.142,00:04:29.143,Wait. What?
00:04:29.560,00:04:32.355,It's perfectly normal to feel confused.
00:04:32.438,00:04:35.984,You just spent 120 years in suspended animation.
00:04:36.859,00:04:37.860,What?
00:04:38.027,00:04:39.445,"It's okay, James."
00:04:42.782,00:04:45.743,Just breathe. Everything is okay.
00:04:45.827,00:04:47.120,Where am I?
00:04:47.203,00:04:53.001,"You're a passenger on the Starship Avalon, the Homestead Company's premier interstellar starliner."
00:04:54.377,00:04:57.797,We've nearly completed the voyage from Earth to your new home.
00:04:58.214,00:05:00.216,The colony world of Homestead II.
00:05:01.426,00:05:04.012,A new world. A fresh start.
00:05:04.095,00:05:05.596,Room to grow.
00:05:07.473,00:05:09.475,The Avalon is on final approach.
00:05:09.559,00:05:13.646,"For the next four months, you'll enjoy space travel at its most luxurious."
00:05:14.188,00:05:16.607,Food. Fun. Friends.
00:05:16.691,00:05:19.152,"-My friends. -That's right, Jim."
00:05:19.527,00:05:23.072,The ID band on your wrist is your key to the wonders of the Avalon.
00:05:25.241,00:05:26.993,"You're in perfect health, Jim."
00:05:27.243,00:05:29.620,"Let's get you to your cabin, where you can get some rest."
00:05:42.717,00:05:45.053,Your door will illuminate for you.
00:05:48.306,00:05:51.893,"Welcome to your cabin, your home until we make landfall."
00:05:52.060,00:06:01.652,"Over the next four months, you'll prepare for your new life on Homestead II, meet your fellow passengers, take skill-building classes, and learn about colonial living."
00:06:02.236,00:06:07.742,You've been assigned to learning group 38 for passengers with engineering and technical trade skills.
00:06:08.076,00:06:10.578,Please scan your ID to confirm luggage delivery.
00:06:12.163,00:06:13.498,Jim.
00:06:13.581,00:06:16.250,Please scan your ID to confirm luggage delivery.
00:06:20.963,00:06:25.218,"To help you recover from hibernation, be sure to drink plenty of fluids."
00:06:27.136,00:06:31.849,"Enjoy the rest of your voyage on the Avalon, a Homestead Company Starship."
00:06:36.020,00:06:38.689,It's a beautiful morning here on the Starship Avalon.
00:06:38.773,00:06:41.442,"Whatever you do, don't get homesick, get Homestead."
00:06:41.526,00:06:43.986,Let's start things off with one of my favorites back on Earth.
00:06:50.743,00:06:51.786,No.
00:06:55.248,00:06:56.624,That's stupid.
00:07:00.545,00:07:03.464,"Just own it. Own it, Jim. You got a cool jacket."
00:07:18.020,00:07:19.564,"Hello, passengers."
00:07:20.314,00:07:22.191,Will you all please take a seat?
00:07:23.693,00:07:26.279,"Welcome, learning group 38."
00:07:26.362,00:07:29.073,Your introduction to colonial life.
00:07:29.740,00:07:33.494,"Earth is a prosperous planet, the cradle of civilization."
00:07:33.911,00:07:38.833,"But for many, it's also overpopulated, overpriced, overrated."
00:07:39.542,00:07:41.502,"I'm sorry, I think I may be in the wrong..."
00:07:41.586,00:07:43.421,"Hold all questions till the end, please."
00:07:43.504,00:07:44.464,Sorry.
00:07:44.547,00:07:47.425,"The colonies offer an alternative, a better way of life."
00:07:47.508,00:07:48.676,Where are all the other...
00:07:48.759,00:07:54.807,"And there's no colony more beautiful than Homestead II, the jewel of the occupied world."
00:07:56.434,00:07:57.602,Where is everybody?
00:07:58.019,00:08:00.062,We are all on the Starship Avalon.
00:08:00.146,00:08:01.522,But I'm the only one here.
00:08:01.647,00:08:05.860,"There are 5,000 passengers and 258 crew members."
00:08:06.277,00:08:07.487,So why am I alone?
00:08:07.987,00:08:09.822,We're all in this together.
00:08:12.116,00:08:13.117,Hello?
00:08:15.077,00:08:16.412,Anybody here?
00:08:16.787,00:08:17.914,Hello?
00:08:32.303,00:08:35.973,This elevator will experience a momentary lapse in gravity.
00:09:15.888,00:09:18.057,Welcome to the grand concourse aboard the Avalon.
00:09:18.140,00:09:19.308,Can I help you?
00:09:20.226,00:09:21.936,I need to talk to a person.
00:09:22.353,00:09:23.854,"A real live person, please?"
00:09:23.938,00:09:26.107,What sort of person? Personal trainer? Travel planner?
00:09:26.274,00:09:27.858,-Therapist? -I don't know.
00:09:27.942,00:09:29.277,Somebody in charge.
00:09:29.360,00:09:31.195,The ship's steward handles passenger affairs.
00:09:31.279,00:09:33.364,It's on level three of the grand concourse.
00:09:33.447,00:09:35.116,-Thank you. -Happy to help.
00:09:40.997,00:09:41.998,Not good.
00:09:43.874,00:09:45.835,"The flight crew, the captain, the pilot, the chief navigator..."
00:09:45.918,00:09:48.004,Captain. I want to speak to the captain.
00:09:48.087,00:09:49.880,The captain rarely handles passenger queries...
00:09:49.964,00:09:51.757,It's an emergency! Please.
00:09:52.216,00:09:55.469,"The captain is usually found on the bridge, in the command ring."
00:10:11.027,00:10:13.904,Bridge access requires special authorization.
00:10:16.782,00:10:18.826,You got to be kidding me.
00:10:36.594,00:10:38.471,What can I show you?
00:10:39.430,00:10:41.390,We're supposed to land soon.
00:10:44.226,00:10:47.063,I... I'm the only one awake.
00:10:47.146,00:10:50.107,I don't understand. What can I show you?
00:10:51.317,00:10:52.693,Show me Homestead II.
00:10:52.777,00:10:56.030,Homestead II is the fourth planet in the Bhakti System.
00:10:56.197,00:10:58.366,Right. And where are we?
00:10:58.449,00:11:01.452,We're in transit from Earth to Homestead II.
00:11:01.619,00:11:04.372,We will arrive in approximately 90 years.
00:11:04.455,00:11:05.456,What?
00:11:05.539,00:11:08.876,"We arrive at Homestead II in 90 years, three weeks, and one day."
00:11:08.959,00:11:10.169,No. Wait.
00:11:10.252,00:11:11.879,How long ago did we leave Earth?
00:11:12.046,00:11:14.548,Approximately 30 years ago.
00:11:18.511,00:11:20.221,I woke up too soon.
00:11:24.183,00:11:25.726,How do I send a message to Earth?
00:11:25.810,00:11:28.229,Interstellar messages are sent by laser array.
00:11:28.312,00:11:29.772,This is an expensive service.
00:11:30.106,00:11:31.732,-Bite me. -Happy to help.
00:11:35.903,00:11:37.863,Earth. The Homestead Company.
00:11:38.072,00:11:42.576,"There are 30,826 contacts listed under Homestead Company."
00:11:42.952,00:11:45.996,I'm emigrating to Homestead II and I have an emergency.
00:11:46.080,00:11:47.248,I have a customer help line.
00:11:47.331,00:11:48.416,Sounds about right.
00:11:48.916,00:11:49.917,Begin message.
00:11:51.085,00:11:53.754,Hi. I'm Jim Preston.
00:11:54.588,00:11:56.090,I'm a passenger on the Avalon.
00:11:56.924,00:11:58.050,I...
00:12:01.303,00:12:04.181,I think something went wrong with my hibernation pod.
00:12:04.265,00:12:05.641,I woke up too soon.
00:12:05.724,00:12:09.395,"And I mean, way too soon."
00:12:09.478,00:12:12.022,"Nobody else is awake, and..."
00:12:12.731,00:12:14.275,I don't know how to get back to sleep.
00:12:14.483,00:12:17.611,"And the thing is, there's 90 years to go."
00:12:20.906,00:12:23.242,"At this rate, I'm..."
00:12:27.121,00:12:29.540,"I'm sorry, I'm trying to fix this."
00:12:29.665,00:12:32.084,Maybe I missed something. I could use a hand.
00:12:33.210,00:12:34.545,That's all.
00:12:35.629,00:12:36.630,Thank you.
00:12:38.007,00:12:39.300,Message sent.
00:12:41.510,00:12:42.553,Outstanding.
00:12:42.636,00:12:45.014,Message will arrive in 19 years.
00:12:45.097,00:12:46.140,"Wait, what?"
00:12:46.307,00:12:48.726,Earliest reply in 55 years.
00:12:49.059,00:12:50.561,Fifty-five years?
00:12:51.145,00:12:53.230,We apologize for the delay.
00:12:53.522,00:12:55.941,"That will be $ 6,012."
00:13:10.039,00:13:11.707,-Afternoon. -Man!
00:13:11.999,00:13:13.834,Is it good to see another face!
00:13:14.335,00:13:15.794,Thought I was the only one awake.
00:13:15.878,00:13:19.006,Who wants to sleep on a beautiful day like this?
00:13:19.215,00:13:22.051,"No, I mean we're in trouble. We're not supposed to be here."
00:13:22.343,00:13:23.969,"Well, I won't tell if you don't."
00:13:24.470,00:13:25.346,Huh?
00:13:25.471,00:13:26.805,Our little secret.
00:13:28.557,00:13:29.850,What can I get for you?
00:13:30.226,00:13:31.227,What?
00:13:31.310,00:13:32.728,You look like a whiskey man.
00:13:33.521,00:13:34.522,Okay.
00:13:39.527,00:13:40.819,You're a robot.
00:13:41.946,00:13:44.114,Android. Technically.
00:13:46.575,00:13:47.618,Arthur's the name.
00:13:48.577,00:13:50.746,"-Jim. -Pleased to meet you, Jim."
00:13:57.086,00:13:58.796,How much do you know about this ship?
00:13:59.296,00:14:00.631,I don't know.
00:14:00.923,00:14:01.966,I know some things.
00:14:02.049,00:14:04.260,What do I do if my hibernation pod malfunctions?
00:14:04.385,00:14:06.887,Hibernation pods are fail-safe.
00:14:07.012,00:14:08.222,They never malfunction.
00:14:08.305,00:14:09.557,"Well, I woke up early."
00:14:09.974,00:14:11.141,Can't happen.
00:14:11.725,00:14:13.602,How long until we get to Homestead II?
00:14:13.769,00:14:15.479,About 90 years or so.
00:14:15.563,00:14:17.648,And when are all the passengers supposed to wake up?
00:14:17.731,00:14:19.567,Not till the last four months.
00:14:20.568,00:14:24.947,How is it that I'm sitting here with you with 90 years to go?
00:14:29.368,00:14:30.911,It's not possible for you to be here.
00:14:33.789,00:14:35.165,"Well, I am."
00:14:42.882,00:14:46.093,"So wake up, sunshine. It's time to relax and enjoy your stay."
00:15:00.774,00:15:04.862,Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme is reserved for gold-class passengers.
00:15:04.945,00:15:07.531,Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme is reserved for...
00:15:07.615,00:15:09.033,I want the Mocha Cappuccino Extreme.
00:15:09.116,00:15:10.159,"Bill my room, please."
00:15:10.242,00:15:11.744,Food can be purchased in the ship's...
00:15:11.827,00:15:13.370,Sorry. The French Roast...
00:15:13.454,00:15:14.788,Sorry. The Pumpkin Spice...
00:15:15.372,00:15:16.457,Sorry. Vanilla Chai...
00:15:16.540,00:15:17.791,Sorry. Sorry.
00:15:17.958,00:15:18.959,Sorry.
00:15:20.002,00:15:21.045,Large coffee.
00:15:21.128,00:15:23.047,-Cream... -Please enjoy your coffee.
00:15:23.589,00:15:24.632,Really?
00:17:35.012,00:17:36.013,Going...
00:17:36.263,00:17:38.015,Please make... Level...
00:17:39.600,00:17:41.268,Grand concourse.
00:17:41.477,00:17:42.603,"I'm screwed, Arthur."
00:17:43.270,00:17:45.147,Completely and ridiculously screwed.
00:17:45.230,00:17:46.565,"Come on, now."
00:17:46.815,00:17:48.859,Every cloud has a silver lining.
00:17:50.819,00:17:53.697,Guess I am gonna die of old age on this ship.
00:17:53.947,00:17:55.157,We all die.
00:17:55.991,00:17:57.785,Even androids end up on the scrap heap.
00:17:59.036,00:18:01.497,I'm your only customer. Why are you always polishing a glass?
00:18:02.498,00:18:03.957,Trick of the trade.
00:18:04.041,00:18:06.710,Makes people nervous when a bartender just stands there.
00:18:06.794,00:18:08.378,So lay some bartender wisdom on me.
00:18:08.462,00:18:10.214,I'm lost in space here.
00:18:12.466,00:18:14.593,You're not where you want to be.
00:18:15.260,00:18:17.805,You feel like you're supposed to be somewhere else.
00:18:22.059,00:18:23.143,You said it.
00:18:23.227,00:18:27.397,"Well, say you could snap your fingers and be wherever you wanted to be."
00:18:27.564,00:18:29.316,I bet you'd still feel this way.
00:18:29.650,00:18:30.859,Not in the right place.
00:18:31.318,00:18:37.324,"Point is, you can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be that you forget how to make the most of where you are."
00:18:37.950,00:18:39.284,What are you telling me?
00:18:39.535,00:18:42.621,Take a break from worrying about what you can't control.
00:18:44.623,00:18:45.707,Live a little.
00:18:46.458,00:18:47.793,Live a little.
00:19:01.306,00:19:02.558,Yeah.
00:19:07.437,00:19:08.647,What?
00:19:16.321,00:19:18.448,-Yeah! Yeah! -Yeah!
00:19:18.740,00:19:20.033,Make that a double jumbo shrimp.
00:19:20.450,00:19:21.326,Triple.
00:19:23.996,00:19:24.872,Dance-off.
00:19:27.124,00:19:28.542,All right.
00:19:30.586,00:19:31.879,I did exactly what you just did.
00:19:52.774,00:19:53.609,Gracias.
00:19:55.652,00:19:58.238,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
00:20:05.746,00:20:07.581,Get out of here!
00:20:09.208,00:20:10.417,Come back. Hey.

00:25:44.501,00:25:45.877,Aurora.
00:25:50.215,00:25:51.925,I'm Aurora Lane.
00:25:52.008,00:25:54.970,Passenger 1456. I'm a writer.
00:25:55.303,00:25:59.641,"I think we tell each other stories to know we're not alone, to make contact."
00:26:03.228,00:26:04.521,"No pressure, right?"
00:26:04.604,00:26:10.360,"My dad used to say, If you live an ordinary life, all you'll have are ordinary stories."
00:26:10.443,00:26:12.404,You have to live a life of adventure.
00:26:13.947,00:26:15.115,So...
00:26:15.991,00:26:17.033,Here I am.
00:26:23.790,00:26:25.250,Good morning.
00:26:27.752,00:26:30.797,We're starting over in every way.
00:26:31.506,00:26:35.510,"I'll have to figure out where to live, how to live, who my friends will be."
00:26:35.593,00:26:37.053,It's like the first day of school.
00:26:37.137,00:26:39.472,If the school bus took 120 years to get there.
00:26:42.392,00:26:44.227,We're creating a culture...
00:26:44.477,00:26:45.562,You are funny.
00:26:45.770,00:26:48.440,Do you ever read something and feel like it's written just for you?
00:26:49.024,00:26:50.900,I don't do a lot of reading.
00:26:51.234,00:26:52.444,She's good.
00:26:53.695,00:26:54.779,Who's that?
00:26:55.113,00:26:56.281,Aurora.
00:26:58.116,00:26:59.284,The sleeping girl.
00:27:04.289,00:27:08.293,"You know, I'm not saying the universe is evil, but it sure has a nasty sense of humor."
00:27:08.418,00:27:09.461,How is that?
00:27:09.544,00:27:13.757,"You get to fly to another planet, but you'll die along the way."
00:27:15.508,00:27:20.555,And you find the perfect woman right in front of you...
00:27:22.182,00:27:24.017,Yet she's completely out of reach.
00:27:27.645,00:27:29.314,"Yeah, I'll miss New York City."
00:27:29.856,00:27:33.234,"Give me a cup of coffee and a view of the Chrysler Building, and I can write all day."
00:27:33.693,00:27:35.779,"They do have coffee on Homestead II, right?"
00:27:35.862,00:27:36.863,They better have coffee.
00:27:36.946,00:27:39.366,"If they don't, I have to turn around and come back to Earth."
00:27:44.079,00:27:47.374,"Yeah, I'll miss the trees in Central Park turning in the fall."
00:27:48.625,00:27:50.210,I'll also miss crowds...
00:27:59.886,00:28:04.974,"Say you were trapped on a desert island, and you had the power to wish somebody there with you."
00:28:05.058,00:28:06.893,You wouldn't be alone anymore.
00:28:07.811,00:28:09.979,But you'd be stranding the person on the island.
00:28:10.063,00:28:12.482,How do you... Would you make that wish?
00:28:12.774,00:28:15.068,I don't know. I've never been on an island.
00:28:15.151,00:28:16.361,"Okay, well, yeah."
00:28:18.113,00:28:19.197,Forget the island.
00:28:20.281,00:28:29.374,"Let's say you figured out how to do something that would make your life a million times better, but you knew it was wrong and there's no taking it back."
00:28:29.457,00:28:30.542,How do you do the math?
00:28:30.750,00:28:32.794,"Jim, these are not robot questions."
00:28:39.342,00:28:40.844,I know how to wake Aurora up.
00:28:41.803,00:28:43.555,"Well, that seems like a fine idea."
00:28:43.805,00:28:44.931,You could use some company.
00:28:45.098,00:28:47.642,I'd be stranding her on this ship for the rest of her life.
00:28:48.560,00:28:49.811,"Well, you can't do that."
00:28:51.354,00:28:52.605,What am I gonna do?
00:28:52.772,00:28:54.023,I'm here for you.
00:28:54.190,00:28:55.942,"Arthur, you're a machine."
00:29:00.363,00:29:03.408,See? You can't feel that. You don't have feelings.
00:29:06.286,00:29:07.412,See?
00:29:07.495,00:29:08.955,That doesn't hurt.
00:29:09.414,00:29:10.790,And you don't even mind.
00:29:11.791,00:29:14.419,'Cause you're not a person.
00:29:21.134,00:29:22.510,Don't even think about it.
00:29:22.594,00:29:24.012,No more Aurora talk.
00:29:24.345,00:29:25.555,I'm over it.
00:29:26.014,00:29:27.015,I'm moving on.
00:29:28.349,00:29:30.143,Don't even think about it!
00:29:30.226,00:29:32.103,What am I gonna do? I'm just gonna sit and think about it?
00:29:32.187,00:29:33.730,"I can't think about it, so I'm not going to."
00:29:33.813,00:29:35.857,That's the deal. I've made my decision.
00:29:35.940,00:29:36.941,I know what I'm doing.
00:29:37.567,00:29:38.568,I just cut it off.
00:29:41.070,00:29:42.238,I'm not... No more.
00:29:42.322,00:29:43.740,You won't hear me bring up her name again.
00:29:43.823,00:29:45.116,I'll never even mention her name again.
00:29:46.117,00:29:46.993,Done.
00:29:49.579,00:29:51.206,You can't do it.
00:29:56.461,00:29:57.754,Shaving off my beard.
00:30:08.932,00:30:10.517,Please don't do it.
00:32:03.129,00:32:04.464,"Good morning, Aurora."
00:32:04.672,00:32:06.466,How are you feeling?
00:32:06.883,00:32:09.469,It's perfectly normal to feel confused.
00:32:09.719,00:32:12.805,You just spent 120 years in suspended animation.
00:33:08.277,00:33:09.529,Anybody?
00:33:18.830,00:33:19.831,Hello.
00:33:23.584,00:33:24.502,Hi.
00:33:27.463,00:33:29.215,Are you passenger or crew?
00:33:31.634,00:33:32.760,Passenger.
00:33:33.386,00:33:34.595,Jim Preston.
00:33:34.679,00:33:36.055,Aurora Lane.
00:33:37.807,00:33:39.559,Do you know what's going on?
00:33:39.642,00:33:41.602,Nobody else from my row woke up.
00:33:42.895,00:33:43.938,Same for me.
00:33:44.022,00:33:49.027,"The crew's supposed to wake up a month before we do, but I haven't seen anybody."
00:33:52.488,00:33:53.948,The crew is still asleep.
00:33:56.117,00:33:57.869,Are you saying nobody's awake?
00:33:58.578,00:33:59.620,Just me.
00:33:59.996,00:34:01.080,Just you?
00:34:01.414,00:34:02.498,It's just us.
00:34:03.583,00:34:05.918,But somebody's got to land the ship in a few weeks.
00:34:10.256,00:34:12.258,Eighty-nine years?
00:34:14.469,00:34:17.305,The other passengers aren't late waking up.
00:34:18.931,00:34:20.308,We were early.
00:34:25.104,00:34:27.356,We need help.
00:34:27.607,00:34:28.900,Where's the crew?
00:34:32.236,00:34:35.782,"Everything important, the controls, the reactors, the engines..."
00:34:35.865,00:34:37.075,It's all behind firewalls.
00:34:37.158,00:34:38.785,There's no way through.
00:34:49.295,00:34:51.380,How long have you been awake?
00:34:52.340,00:34:54.092,A year and three weeks.
00:34:54.842,00:34:57.386,"No. No, no, no."
00:34:58.387,00:34:59.806,"No, this can't be happening."
00:35:00.515,00:35:02.308,We have to go back to sleep.
00:35:02.975,00:35:04.268,"Aurora, we can't."
00:35:07.021,00:35:10.399,We just have to get back to our pods and start them up again.
00:35:11.692,00:35:14.362,I can't find my pod. I can't find my pod.
00:35:14.445,00:35:16.697,I can't find my pod. I don't know which...
00:35:16.781,00:35:18.199,It doesn't matter.
00:35:19.617,00:35:20.910,-Aurora... -I can't find it!
00:35:20.993,00:35:22.662,-Stop. Aurora... -I can't find which one is mine!
00:35:22.745,00:35:24.413,-Stop. -I don't know which one is mine!
00:35:24.497,00:35:25.581,-I'll help you. -I can't...
00:35:25.665,00:35:28.167,Stop! It doesn't matter.
00:35:34.799,00:35:39.178,"Remember the facility where they put us under, all the procedures we went through?"
00:35:39.262,00:35:44.851,"These pods are designed to keep us in hibernation, to wake us up at the right time, but they can't put us back to sleep."
00:35:45.017,00:35:47.812,You don't think there's a way back into hibernation?
00:35:49.313,00:35:50.356,No.
00:35:50.731,00:35:52.316,But there has to be.
00:35:53.109,00:35:54.569,There has to be.
00:36:03.452,00:36:06.205,Nine o'clock. Nighttime.
00:36:11.127,00:36:14.172,"I know I should be working the problem, but..."
00:36:14.881,00:36:16.591,I can't even keep my eyes open.
00:36:17.842,00:36:19.635,You just came out of hibernation.
00:36:19.719,00:36:22.054,It's going to be a couple of days before you're 100%.
00:36:22.138,00:36:23.556,You should get some rest.
00:36:24.765,00:36:26.309,Think I'm gonna have to.
00:36:27.727,00:36:29.020,I'll walk you to your cabin.
00:36:29.103,00:36:31.647,"No, it's okay. I'll be all right."
00:36:33.149,00:36:34.150,Okay.
00:36:37.570,00:36:38.613,"Good night, Aurora."
00:36:41.032,00:36:42.325,More than a year?
00:36:42.575,00:36:43.951,I can't imagine.
00:36:45.077,00:36:46.537,It must have been so hard for you.
00:36:47.580,00:36:48.623,It was.
00:36:49.290,00:36:50.249,"Good night, Jim."
00:36:58.716,00:37:00.968,"-Whiskey, neat. -Sure thing."
00:37:07.225,00:37:08.267,How's your day been?
00:37:10.061,00:37:11.145,Aurora's awake.
00:37:11.437,00:37:13.064,Congratulations.
00:37:15.274,00:37:16.651,You don't look happy.
00:37:20.988,00:37:22.698,"Arthur, can you keep a secret?"
00:37:22.990,00:37:24.033,Jim...
00:37:24.367,00:37:26.953,"I'm not just a bartender, I'm a gentleman."
00:37:27.578,00:37:29.830,Don't tell Aurora that I woke her up.
00:37:32.208,00:37:34.669,She thinks it was an accident. Let me tell her.
00:37:35.086,00:37:36.295,Of course.
00:37:49.892,00:37:52.186,How can there be no way to put someone back into hibernation?
00:37:52.270,00:37:53.688,What if a pod breaks down?
00:37:58.526,00:38:01.070,"Well, I'm awake."
00:38:01.153,00:38:03.489,Hibernation pods are fail-safe.
00:38:04.073,00:38:05.324,Good morning.
00:38:05.408,00:38:07.994,-Have you eaten? -No. I'm starving.
00:38:08.494,00:38:10.538,And this is the dumbest machine.
00:38:10.830,00:38:12.123,Happy to help.
00:38:37.690,00:38:39.233,"Well, you're a man of simple tastes."
00:38:39.900,00:38:41.944,I'm not a gold-class passenger.
00:38:44.363,00:38:46.449,French breakfast puff's above my pay grade.
00:38:46.532,00:38:47.992,What? This whole time?
00:38:48.075,00:38:49.994,-Yeah. -What can I get you?
00:38:50.077,00:38:51.912,"-No. No, I'm fine. -Stop it."
00:38:51.996,00:38:53.748,Really. Okay.
00:38:55.541,00:38:56.834,Here you go.
00:39:02.006,00:39:03.007,Yeah.
00:39:03.424,00:39:06.677,"So, I was thinking, maybe there's another way to go to sleep."
00:39:06.761,00:39:07.970,What about the infirmary?
00:39:08.054,00:39:10.306,I checked it out. It's just scanners and an Autodoc.
00:39:10.389,00:39:12.808,There could be another hibernation machine in the cargo hold.
00:39:12.933,00:39:14.101,"I had that thought, too."
00:39:14.352,00:39:15.436,And then I read the manifest.
00:39:15.519,00:39:17.605,"It's mostly farming stuff, machines, and trade goods."
00:39:18.064,00:39:20.191,Replacement parts for computers and engineering.
00:39:20.483,00:39:22.651,We're not gonna find a hibernation facility in a box.
00:39:22.735,00:39:24.487,-We could build our own. -We can't.
00:39:24.570,00:39:25.654,"Jim, you're not even trying."
00:39:25.738,00:39:28.032,I have tried everything.
00:39:28.324,00:39:29.909,"For over a year, I..."
00:39:31.494,00:39:32.620,I tried everything.
00:39:32.870,00:39:33.996,Well...
00:39:35.581,00:39:37.333,"Well, I'm not ready to give up."
00:39:56.102,00:39:58.854,What about research articles? Any kind of technical documents.
00:40:01.607,00:40:05.319,The following articles deal with the subject on a theoretical level.
00:40:48.779,00:40:50.906,New file. My voyage.
00:40:52.074,00:40:55.744,"I boarded the Avalon with an idea, a destination."
00:40:56.620,00:40:59.915,Both now out of reach.
00:41:02.376,00:41:04.128,I've been awake for seven days.
00:41:04.879,00:41:07.006,Awake far too soon.
00:41:07.465,00:41:14.180,"And I may well spend the rest of my life here, in a steel world 1,000 meters long."
00:41:15.639,00:41:20.019,"There's another passenger awake, a mechanic named Jim Preston."
00:41:22.146,00:41:24.690,He seems to have accepted our fate.
00:41:25.733,00:41:27.568,But I'm scared.
00:41:28.402,00:41:30.029,I'm fighting to stay calm.
00:41:32.948,00:41:43.709,"All the other passengers will sleep for another 90 years, while I live out my life on this ship, traveling forever..."
00:41:45.002,00:41:46.670,Never arriving...
00:41:47.505,00:41:49.882,My only companion a total stranger.
00:41:59.183,00:42:00.267,Why did you do it?
00:42:03.145,00:42:04.063,Do what?
00:42:05.564,00:42:08.025,Emigrate. Leave Earth.
00:42:09.151,00:42:10.611,I'm interviewing you.
00:42:11.111,00:42:11.987,You're what?
00:42:12.071,00:42:15.324,You were the first hibernation failure in the history of space travel.
00:42:15.533,00:42:16.659,That makes you a story.
00:42:17.576,00:42:18.869,Who you gonna tell?
00:42:18.953,00:42:20.120,Posterity.
00:42:20.246,00:42:23.082,"So, why did you give up your life on Earth?"
00:42:23.582,00:42:27.670,A 120-year space hibernation means you'll never see your family or friends again.
00:42:27.920,00:42:31.215,You'll wake up in a new century on a new planet.
00:42:31.924,00:42:33.926,It's the ultimate geographical suicide.
00:42:34.218,00:42:36.428,"Well, I could ask you the same thing."
00:42:36.512,00:42:38.138,But it's my interview.
00:42:38.764,00:42:40.391,Were you running away from something?
00:42:40.766,00:42:41.642,No.
00:42:42.518,00:42:44.353,-Everything was okay. -So?
00:42:44.895,00:42:47.606,"Well, I guess I just wanted a new world, I don't know, a fresh start."
00:42:47.690,00:42:49.608,That's Homestead Company advertising.
00:42:49.692,00:42:51.110,-Is it? -Jim.
00:42:51.277,00:42:53.153,I know. I guess. You're right.
00:42:58.617,00:43:01.537,"Back on Earth, when something breaks, you don't fix it, you replace it."
00:43:02.454,00:43:04.707,"The colonies, they have problems to solve."
00:43:05.249,00:43:06.792,They're my kind of problems.
00:43:08.627,00:43:10.296,And a mechanic is somebody.
00:43:10.796,00:43:12.965,This is a new world still being built.
00:43:15.134,00:43:17.052,I could build a house and live in it.
00:43:22.224,00:43:24.935,Open country. Room to grow.
00:43:25.227,00:43:26.520,Now you're back to slogans.
00:43:26.895,00:43:28.355,Can't slogans be true?
00:43:30.190,00:43:33.736,Do you know how much Homestead Company made off its first planet?
00:43:33.819,00:43:35.863,Eight quadrillion dollars.
00:43:35.946,00:43:38.657,That's eight million billions.
00:43:38.741,00:43:41.160,Colony planets are the biggest business going.
00:43:41.619,00:43:43.245,Did you pay full price for your ticket?
00:43:43.454,00:43:45.706,No. I'm in a desirable trade.
00:43:45.789,00:43:55.591,"So they fill your head with dreams, discount your ticket, and you fly off to populate their planet, and give Homestead 20% of everything that you make for the rest of your life."
00:43:55.674,00:43:58.594,Not to mention the debt you run up on this fancy starship.
00:43:58.677,00:44:01.180,"So all you see here is 5,000 suckers?"
00:44:02.056,00:44:05.434,I see zeros on the Homestead Company's bottom line.
00:44:05.851,00:44:08.854,"I see 5,000 men and women changing their lives."
00:44:09.730,00:44:12.399,"For 5,000 different reasons. You don't know these people."
00:44:12.524,00:44:15.194,I'm a journalist. I know people.
00:44:17.112,00:44:18.113,Really?
00:44:18.781,00:44:19.782,This one.
00:44:20.157,00:44:22.660,"Is he a banker, a teacher, or a gardener?"
00:44:24.286,00:44:26.080,-Banker. -He's a gardener.
00:44:27.665,00:44:30.209,And her. Is she a...
00:44:30.501,00:44:33.045,"Madison, Donna, or a Lola?"
00:44:34.380,00:44:36.382,Donna's too serious for that hair.
00:44:36.632,00:44:37.633,Lola.
00:44:38.509,00:44:40.511,-Madison. -Shit!
00:44:42.721,00:44:45.766,"All right, chef, accountant, or midwife?"
00:44:45.849,00:44:46.850,She has to be a midwife.
00:44:46.934,00:44:48.477,There's no way you just made that one up.
00:44:48.560,00:44:49.603,Yeah. She's a midwife.
00:44:51.355,00:44:53.148,I didn't know they still had midwives.
00:44:55.609,00:44:58.112,I like her. We'd be friends.
00:44:58.737,00:45:00.114,You think you can see that?
00:45:00.572,00:45:01.657,Don't you?
00:45:04.118,00:45:05.285,I do.
00:45:05.494,00:45:07.996,-A round-trip ticket? -That's right.
00:45:08.080,00:45:11.875,"I was gonna fly to Homestead II, live for a year, and then right back to Earth."
00:45:12.167,00:45:15.504,"I don't get it. I left Earth for a new life, but you end up back where you started?"
00:45:15.587,00:45:16.964,I end up in the future.
00:45:17.339,00:45:23.679,"Two hundred and fifty years in the future, on Earth, which is still the center of civilization, like it or not."
00:45:24.596,00:45:28.016,And I'll be the only writer to ever travel to a colony world and come back.
00:45:28.100,00:45:30.018,I'll have a story no one else can tell.
00:45:30.102,00:45:31.145,What story?
00:45:31.687,00:45:34.022,Humanity's flight to the stars.
00:45:34.106,00:45:36.024,The greatest migration in human history.
00:45:36.108,00:45:37.776,It's the biggest story there is.
00:45:37.943,00:45:40.028,But you won't know any of the people who are reading it.
00:45:40.112,00:45:41.196,But they'd be reading it.
00:45:43.824,00:45:45.200,Or they would have been.
00:45:47.119,00:45:48.370,I'll never write it now.
00:45:48.912,00:45:50.581,I don't know if I'll ever write again.
00:45:53.250,00:45:58.464,"Jim, I can't think of anything else to try to save us."
00:46:00.424,00:46:02.759,And I don't even want to think about it anymore.
00:46:05.345,00:46:06.763,What is there to do around here?
00:46:09.808,00:46:11.977,-Are you serious? -Dead serious.
00:46:16.148,00:46:17.316,"Come on, get in power mode."
00:46:24.198,00:46:25.532,You just stand here.
00:46:25.824,00:46:27.242,And then we repeat what they do.
00:46:35.626,00:46:37.711,Is there anything else we can do?
00:46:37.794,00:46:38.837,-Just do the... -Okay.
00:46:38.921,00:46:40.005,-You don't have to. -Okay. I can...
00:46:43.050,00:46:44.510,Here we go. Let's see it.
00:46:45.052,00:46:46.512,Whoa! Whoa!
00:46:48.013,00:46:49.932,-Why you smiling? -Aurora! Aurora!
00:46:50.015,00:46:51.600,'Cause I'm up two points.
00:46:52.184,00:46:53.519,Who's the lovely lady?
00:46:53.602,00:46:54.978,This is Aurora.
00:46:55.062,00:46:57.231,Aurora. A pleasure.
00:47:00.192,00:47:01.735,-I can't! -You did great!
00:47:01.818,00:47:03.570,"Okay, one more time. One more time, let's see it."
00:47:15.832,00:47:16.833,Yes!
00:47:20.170,00:47:21.964,"I swear, I didn't wear pants for a month."
00:47:22.214,00:47:24.633,"Seven weeks and two days, to be exact."
00:47:24.716,00:47:25.968,The man has no shame.
00:47:26.218,00:47:28.720,"Well, you're a little lacking in that area yourself, Arthur."
00:47:32.057,00:47:35.727,I laughed at the man with no pants until I realized I have no legs.
00:47:42.234,00:47:44.653,"For a minute, I almost forgot my life is in ruins."
00:47:45.070,00:47:46.280,I'm sorry.
00:47:47.030,00:47:48.115,What for?
00:47:49.908,00:47:51.159,I'm gonna go to bed.
00:47:52.244,00:47:53.203,Good night.
00:47:53.287,00:47:54.913,"-All right. -Good night, Aurora."
00:47:58.500,00:48:00.002,She is wonderful.
00:48:01.503,00:48:02.629,Excellent choice.
00:49:30.967,00:49:31.968,Hello.
00:49:32.844,00:49:33.845,Hi.
00:49:34.221,00:49:35.138,Here you go.
00:49:41.520,00:49:43.271,Is he asking me on a date?
00:49:45.649,00:49:47.150,Do you need a pen?
00:49:59.871,00:50:01.581,She didn't seem that impressed.
00:50:19.808,00:50:21.935,"Love to. She wrote, Love to."
00:50:29.943,00:50:31.528,You have a visitor.
00:50:50.255,00:50:51.089,Wow.
00:50:51.631,00:50:53.508,You clean up pretty good yourself.
00:50:54.342,00:50:55.427,You went shopping.
00:50:55.510,00:50:57.012,I went shoplifting.
00:51:02.517,00:51:03.518,Evening.
00:51:03.602,00:51:04.853,What can I get for you?
00:51:04.936,00:51:06.938,"I'll have a Manhattan, please."
00:51:08.482,00:51:10.400,"-Whiskey, rocks. -Coming up."
00:51:18.700,00:51:20.368,You two look fine this evening.
00:51:20.535,00:51:23.038,"Thank you, Arthur. We're on a date."
00:51:23.622,00:51:24.915,Very nice.
00:51:25.665,00:51:27.501,Took you long enough to ask.
00:51:27.876,00:51:29.294,I was giving you space.
00:51:31.254,00:51:32.214,Space.
00:51:32.297,00:51:34.633,The one thing I do not need more of.
00:51:41.097,00:51:42.432,That was so good.
00:51:42.516,00:51:44.184,It wasn't easy getting a reservation.
00:51:44.476,00:51:46.853,They're probably gonna want us to give up our table.
00:51:46.937,00:51:48.188,I'm getting a lot of dirty looks.
00:51:48.271,00:51:49.815,Very popular tonight.
00:51:51.858,00:51:53.318,So how's your book coming?
00:51:53.527,00:51:55.487,I don't really know what it is yet.
00:51:56.655,00:52:00.367,"My dad, he used to always write about his life, but he had stories."
00:52:00.450,00:52:03.286,He'd sailed around Antarctica.
00:52:04.246,00:52:05.539,He was a war reporter.
00:52:05.622,00:52:07.833,He had lovers.
00:52:08.333,00:52:09.543,He wrote about his daughter.
00:52:10.460,00:52:11.461,He wrote about you?
00:52:11.545,00:52:14.297,Yeah. I grew up reading about myself in his books.
00:52:14.381,00:52:15.382,How was that?
00:52:16.675,00:52:17.759,Not always easy.
00:52:18.009,00:52:20.428,A little more than you wanted to know about yourself.
00:52:21.012,00:52:26.017,"And then, when I was 17, he had a heart attack."
00:52:27.477,00:52:29.020,Right at his keypad.
00:52:29.896,00:52:31.273,End of story.
00:52:34.484,00:52:37.070,That was so serious. I'm sorry.
00:52:37.696,00:52:38.822,We need more wine.
00:52:38.905,00:52:40.448,I like hearing about your life.
00:52:42.117,00:52:43.368,Thanks.
00:52:45.787,00:52:47.205,Why are we here?
00:52:47.289,00:52:48.415,You'll see.
00:52:50.542,00:52:52.085,Best show in town.
00:52:55.964,00:52:57.757,So you've done this before?
00:52:58.133,00:52:59.342,Yeah.
00:52:59.676,00:53:00.886,And it's safe?
00:53:01.177,00:53:02.304,No.
00:53:03.597,00:53:04.890,Reasonably safe.
00:53:06.850,00:53:09.019,Hop in. You're next.
00:53:10.604,00:53:11.855,What about my dress?
00:53:14.733,00:53:15.734,Right.
00:53:18.737,00:53:19.946,Turn around.
00:54:33.478,00:54:34.646,What are you doing?
00:54:35.355,00:54:36.439,Do you trust me?
00:55:23.820,00:55:25.280,Thank you.
00:56:14.370,00:56:16.581,You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
00:56:20.335,00:56:22.045,You kill me.
00:57:04.629,00:57:05.755,You okay?
00:57:06.631,00:57:07.507,Yeah.
00:57:09.843,00:57:10.885,I'm fine.
00:57:11.553,00:57:12.846,It's just...
00:57:20.645,00:57:21.938,"Yeah, I know."
00:57:40.748,00:57:42.417,You'll never guess who.
00:57:43.877,00:57:47.046,We're the last two people in the world who would ever get together.
00:57:47.755,00:57:49.382,But here we are.
00:57:49.466,00:57:50.884,The last two people in the world.
00:57:51.342,00:57:52.385,What's that?
00:57:52.469,00:57:53.887,"I'm writing, Arthur. Hush."
00:57:55.221,00:57:58.266,Jim and I live in accidental happiness.
00:57:58.349,00:58:01.269,"Like castaways, making their home on strange shores."
00:58:01.352,00:58:03.521,Strange shores. I love it.
00:58:03.605,00:58:04.898,You do? You don't have to say that.
00:58:04.981,00:58:07.025,-I know. -You're not gonna eat this.
00:58:09.736,00:58:11.070,Does that seem fishy to you?
00:58:13.281,00:58:14.324,Keep reading.
00:58:14.866,00:58:15.950,It's funny.
00:58:16.367,00:58:17.952,We all have dreams.
00:58:19.078,00:58:22.207,We plan our futures like we're the captains of our fates.
00:58:23.041,00:58:24.626,But we're passengers.
00:58:24.709,00:58:26.628,We go where fate takes us.
00:58:26.753,00:58:31.299,I can't Help Arthur!
00:58:33.468,00:58:34.802,But it's ours.
00:58:35.178,00:58:39.432,"And for the first time in my life, I don't feel alone."
00:58:42.310,00:58:44.395,We weren't supposed to find each other.
00:58:46.147,00:58:47.440,But we did.
00:58:48.399,00:58:51.236,He makes me feel like my life isn't over.
00:58:51.569,00:58:53.321,Like it's just beginning.
00:58:54.322,00:58:55.448,How was your day?
00:58:55.532,00:58:57.534,Good. I wrote a few pages.
00:58:58.034,00:58:59.744,Did you find anything that can help us?
00:59:03.623,00:59:05.250,-I did. -Are they real?
00:59:06.042,00:59:07.669,I cut them myself.
00:59:11.339,00:59:14.092,"You know, for two unlucky people, we sure got pretty lucky."
00:59:21.224,00:59:24.561,You may wish to proceed to a viewing area.
00:59:24.936,00:59:28.273,The Avalon will slingshot around the star Arcturus.
00:59:28.356,00:59:29.440,Look!
00:59:29.941,00:59:31.776,"Oh, my God!"
01:00:07.103,01:00:08.855,That was amazing.
01:00:10.815,01:00:12.400,A red giant.
01:00:17.071,01:00:19.032,The universe's present to you.
01:00:19.574,01:00:20.658,What?
01:00:22.160,01:00:23.995,Happy birthday.
01:00:31.169,01:00:53.191,"Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Aurora Happy birthday to you Aren't you going to ask for my ID?"
01:00:53.274,01:00:54.442,I might not be old enough to drink.
01:00:54.525,01:00:56.986,I would never ask your age in front of a gentleman.
01:00:57.403,01:00:58.905,Jim's no gentleman.
01:00:58.988,01:01:01.449,"Anyway, there's no secrets between me and Jim."
01:01:02.659,01:01:05.370,-Is that so? -You heard the lady.
01:01:05.870,01:01:06.954,I will be right back.
01:01:21.886,01:01:23.971,This is a perfect birthday drink. Thank you.
01:01:24.472,01:01:27.725,I remember this day a year ago.
01:01:27.809,01:01:29.852,Jim was so looking forward to meeting you.
01:01:31.145,01:01:32.146,What?
01:01:32.897,01:01:34.774,How could he be looking forward to it?
01:01:34.899,01:01:37.652,He spent months deciding whether to wake you up.
01:01:38.319,01:01:40.822,He couldn't stop talking about you.
01:01:45.159,01:01:46.744,Jim woke me up?
01:01:47.704,01:01:48.788,Yes.
01:01:49.664,01:01:52.333,He said it was the hardest decision of his life.
01:01:52.625,01:01:55.211,But I see it worked out just fine.
01:02:07.598,01:02:08.766,What?
01:02:11.686,01:02:13.104,Did you wake me up?
01:02:21.112,01:02:22.196,"Yes, I woke you up."
01:02:26.951,01:02:28.161,How...
01:02:28.911,01:02:30.121,How could you do it?
01:02:33.374,01:02:34.751,I tried not to.
01:02:41.382,01:02:42.842,I'm gonna be sick.
01:02:44.093,01:02:45.553,I can't see.
01:02:47.638,01:02:48.723,"Aurora, please..."
01:02:49.182,01:02:51.559,Stay away from me!
01:02:54.896,01:02:56.522,I can't get off this ship.
01:02:56.606,01:02:59.025,I can't get off this ship. I can't get off.
01:03:11.329,01:03:12.330,No!
01:03:26.260,01:03:27.345,"Oh, God."
01:04:15.017,01:04:16.561,Can I talk to you?
01:05:47.234,01:05:49.987,I know nothing I can say will make this okay.
01:05:50.696,01:05:51.989,But please listen.
01:05:52.657,01:05:56.619,I was so alone for so long.
01:05:58.204,01:05:59.705,It felt like I was disappearing.
01:06:01.207,01:06:04.210,"The night I first saw you, I was ready to..."
01:06:07.630,01:06:08.798,You saved my life.
01:06:12.009,01:06:14.971,And I know that's no excuse for what I did.
01:06:16.430,01:06:24.897,"I read everything you wrote, and I fell in love with your voice and with the way your mind works."
01:06:25.314,01:06:27.441,I fell in love with you.
01:06:28.859,01:06:33.906,"And all of a sudden, it was like I wasn't trapped anymore."
01:06:34.991,01:06:38.202,My pointless life suddenly had meaning.
01:06:40.663,01:06:42.581,And I wish I could take it back.
01:06:44.291,01:06:45.751,But I can't.
01:06:47.253,01:06:48.796,"Aurora, I don't want to lose you."
01:06:48.879,01:06:51.007,I don't care!
01:06:51.215,01:06:53.259,I don't care what you want!
01:06:53.551,01:06:56.178,I don't care why you woke me up!
01:06:56.679,01:06:59.348,You took my life!
01:07:23.998,01:07:26.959,Your suite's control center is rebooting.
01:08:02.411,01:08:04.121,"I envy you, Arthur."
01:08:05.122,01:08:06.123,How so?
01:08:06.373,01:08:08.042,You have a purpose.
01:08:10.753,01:08:11.879,You're always happy.
01:08:13.047,01:08:14.799,How's your book coming along?
01:08:15.424,01:08:17.426,I've never written about myself before.
01:08:17.927,01:08:21.806,"I think it's some of the best work I've ever done, and I don't even know why I'm doing it."
01:08:23.057,01:08:25.935,"There's only one person who could read it, and I can't stand him."
01:08:26.227,01:08:29.647,They say time heals all wounds.
01:08:32.858,01:08:35.027,"Broken hearts aren't that simple, Arthur."
01:08:38.072,01:08:39.490,You wouldn't understand.
01:08:47.206,01:08:48.874,Tuesday's my day with Arthur.
01:08:49.250,01:08:50.334,It's Wednesday.
01:08:58.676,01:08:59.760,The bar's all yours.
01:09:08.853,01:09:10.479,What'll you have? Whiskey?
01:09:11.981,01:09:12.982,Coffee.
01:09:13.607,01:09:14.984,Aurora! We love you!
01:09:15.067,01:09:17.194,What are we gonna do without you? We'll miss you so...
01:09:20.156,01:09:21.490,You're the bravest woman I know.
01:09:23.325,01:09:27.079,I promise that I will think of you every day.
01:09:27.163,01:09:32.126,"When you wake up, I'll be gone, but just know that I will never forget you."
01:09:32.918,01:09:34.170,You're my best friend.
01:09:35.629,01:09:38.090,You were never happy here. I know.
01:09:38.591,01:09:40.467,Nothing was ever enough for you.
01:09:42.344,01:09:44.305,"You know, you don't have to go."
01:09:44.388,01:09:47.266,You could do whatever it is you have to do right here.
01:09:49.518,01:09:50.519,But...
01:09:50.978,01:09:54.023,"Since you're going, here's my wish."
01:09:56.358,01:10:02.948,"I hope you finally find someone who fills your heart, and I hope you let him in."
01:10:04.783,01:10:08.704,I hope you realize you don't have to do something amazing to be happy.
01:10:11.248,01:10:16.212,"You know, have fun, take chances."
01:10:18.088,01:10:19.965,"Um, okay."
01:10:21.383,01:10:22.885,"I love you, Aurora."
01:10:23.552,01:10:24.678,Bye.
01:10:27.848,01:10:29.183,"Morning, Arthur!"
01:10:29.725,01:10:31.644,"-Coffee, please. -Coming up."
01:10:37.733,01:10:39.777,Are you soiling my barstool?
01:10:39.860,01:10:42.363,"You want to make things, you got to get your hands dirty."
01:10:43.072,01:10:44.406,And what have you been making?
01:10:44.698,01:10:45.950,Improvements.
01:11:52.349,01:11:55.352,Who the hell planted a tree on my ship?
01:12:16.832,01:12:18.667,-Who did that? -I did.
01:12:19.418,01:12:20.419,Who are you?
01:12:20.794,01:12:21.795,Jim Preston.
01:12:23.589,01:12:24.590,Aurora Lane.
01:12:25.174,01:12:26.425,Anybody else awake?
01:12:26.508,01:12:27.760,Just me and him.
01:12:28.677,01:12:30.346,How far along are we?
01:12:31.013,01:12:32.222,Eighty-eight years to go.
01:12:40.898,01:12:42.483,Hibernation failure.
01:12:43.984,01:12:45.736,They said that couldn't happen.
01:12:45.819,01:12:49.031,"Three people, three pod failures."
01:12:54.370,01:12:57.039,You have no idea how long I've been trying to get in there.
01:12:57.122,01:12:59.458,"Now that you're in, don't touch anything."
01:13:01.335,01:13:03.629,"No, this is flight crew. I'm a deck chief."
01:13:04.630,01:13:06.757,"Ops, Navigation, Comm."
01:13:07.424,01:13:08.717,Hmm.
01:13:12.971,01:13:14.014,Sorry.
01:13:16.183,01:13:19.395,"If I'm reading this right, we're still on course."
01:13:19.478,01:13:22.189,"So whatever's wrong with the ship, NavCom is still on the job."
01:13:22.272,01:13:23.732,There's something wrong with the ship?
01:13:23.941,01:13:26.360,"Three pod failures? Yeah, there's something wrong."
01:13:26.443,01:13:28.070,Question is what.
01:13:30.781,01:13:32.032,That's strange.
01:13:32.533,01:13:36.870,"We should be getting diagnostics from all over the ship right here, but there's no data."
01:13:38.789,01:13:40.457,Got to check all the systems manually.
01:13:40.541,01:13:42.668,"Can't we turn the ship around, go back to Earth?"
01:13:42.751,01:13:44.044,"No, we're doing 50% of light speed."
01:13:44.128,01:13:46.422,Turning back would take just as much time as going on.
01:13:46.505,01:13:48.257,"Well, there's got to be something we can do."
01:13:48.340,01:13:50.759,Sorry. We're going where we're going.
01:13:53.637,01:13:54.555,You okay?
01:13:55.597,01:13:57.182,Hibernation hangover.
01:13:57.433,01:13:58.642,Get it all the time.
01:14:01.311,01:14:02.479,"Two years, huh?"
01:14:02.563,01:14:04.523,Any more trees I need to know about?
01:14:10.946,01:14:12.406,Never seen that before.
01:14:12.614,01:14:14.366,These robots have been breaking down.
01:14:14.450,01:14:17.077,This guy makes fifteen?
01:14:17.703,01:14:18.745,Fifteen.
01:14:18.829,01:14:20.289,The breakfast bar went crazy today.
01:14:20.372,01:14:22.708,"-Yeah, and an elevator. -Last week, my door broke."
01:14:22.791,01:14:25.085,-I was trapped in my cabin for two days. -You were?
01:14:26.462,01:14:28.881,Things like that don't happen. Not on this ship.
01:14:29.631,01:14:32.092,There are 16 of these tech stations on every deck.
01:14:32.885,01:14:34.136,Dock your slate.
01:14:34.678,01:14:36.138,-Data syncs automatically. Got it? -Hmm.
01:14:38.098,01:14:40.434,You take decks one and two. You take decks three and four.
01:14:40.517,01:14:44.313,"I'm going down to the hibernation bay, check our pods."
01:14:45.063,01:14:46.607,"Well, that should be interesting."
01:14:57.451,01:14:59.203,Ain't you supposed to be making your rounds?
01:15:00.245,01:15:01.538,I'm finished.
01:15:04.208,01:15:05.918,I checked your pod.
01:15:06.877,01:15:09.505,Problem's very simple. The clock chip's burnt out.
01:15:09.588,01:15:12.341,"It ain't supposed to happen, but pretty simple."
01:15:12.424,01:15:13.926,My pod's more complicated.
01:15:14.009,01:15:16.929,Bunch of system failures that all happened at the same time.
01:15:17.012,01:15:18.805,Whole damn thing went haywire.
01:15:21.141,01:15:23.018,Explains why I'm feeling so bad.
01:15:23.352,01:15:24.686,But Aurora's pod...
01:15:28.857,01:15:30.400,You did this.
01:15:34.112,01:15:38.116,"All this time, I'm thinking you're one lucky son of a bitch to get stuck with Aurora."
01:15:41.578,01:15:43.455,"It wasn't luck, was it?"
01:15:45.332,01:15:46.458,She knows?
01:15:47.000,01:15:48.168,She knows.
01:15:50.295,01:15:51.505,How long were you alone?
01:15:52.005,01:15:53.382,A year.
01:15:57.135,01:15:58.178,Still...
01:16:00.180,01:16:01.390,Damn.
01:16:13.068,01:16:14.319,Data received.
01:16:19.199,01:16:21.243,-Data received. -Same as Jim's.
01:16:21.326,01:16:22.536,Interpolating data.
01:16:22.619,01:16:24.621,System shutdowns...
01:16:24.705,01:16:26.999,"Everywhere, but no apparent connection."
01:16:28.959,01:16:30.419,You saw the hibernation pods?
01:16:31.753,01:16:32.754,I saw them.
01:16:33.630,01:16:34.673,Data received.
01:16:34.756,01:16:35.966,So you know...
01:16:37.593,01:16:38.594,What Jim did.
01:16:41.430,01:16:42.514,Yeah.
01:16:43.849,01:16:44.850,And?
01:16:45.100,01:16:47.436,-It's not my... -He woke me up.
01:16:48.103,01:16:49.313,He took away my life.
01:16:49.396,01:16:51.565,"I know, and I'm sorry, but there's work I'd..."
01:16:51.648,01:16:53.066,It's murder.
01:16:56.445,01:16:57.946,"You're right, Aurora."
01:16:58.030,01:17:01.408,But the drowning man will always try and drag somebody down with him.
01:17:01.783,01:17:04.620,"It ain't right, but the man's drowning."
01:17:06.413,01:17:08.081,This one makes 16.
01:17:15.172,01:17:16.882,Hey. You okay?
01:17:22.721,01:17:27.100,"But just a couple hours, and then back at it first thing in the morning."
01:20:14.309,01:20:16.061,I was in the pool when the gravity gave out.
01:20:16.144,01:20:17.187,Are you okay?
01:20:17.270,01:20:18.480,We need to find Gus.
01:20:22.984,01:20:26.196,Gravity loss means that whatever's wrong is starting to hit the big-ticket items.
01:20:26.279,01:20:27.531,Not good.
01:20:28.448,01:20:30.158,Every failure's a burnt out processor.
01:20:30.242,01:20:32.577,Everything on board's thinking too hard.
01:20:33.411,01:20:34.579,Why?
01:20:35.580,01:20:38.124,"Computer, display these failures over time."
01:20:41.753,01:20:43.129,Cascade failure.
01:20:44.256,01:20:46.508,It started two years ago. Power surge.
01:20:47.592,01:20:49.761,Seventeen failures in one day.
01:20:50.512,01:20:52.681,Including hibernation pod 1498.
01:20:52.764,01:20:53.807,That's me.
01:20:54.474,01:20:55.684,Woke me up.
01:20:57.602,01:21:00.146,-What happened that day? -Something big.
01:21:00.230,01:21:02.357,A major system went down somewhere.
01:21:02.983,01:21:06.736,"Everything else on board is trying to pick up the load, but the load's too heavy."
01:21:06.903,01:21:08.738,"Whatever started this, we got to find it."
01:21:09.406,01:21:11.449,-And fix it. -How bad can this get?
01:21:16.872,01:21:19.374,A mission-critical failure is imminent.
01:21:19.457,01:21:22.460,"Failing systems. Life Support, Fusion Reactor..."
01:21:22.544,01:21:23.628,So we're stranded.
01:21:23.712,01:21:25.672,"Hibernation Bay, Ion Drive..."
01:21:25.755,01:21:27.257,On a sinking ship.
01:21:38.184,01:21:41.062,Not a lot of things big enough to hit this ship that hard.
01:21:44.107,01:21:46.818,"With Diagnostics out, we'll have to find it ourselves."
01:22:03.793,01:22:05.253,It's a few things.
01:22:08.298,01:22:09.549,Get me out of here.
01:22:24.272,01:22:25.732,What's the prognosis?
01:22:30.278,01:22:34.115,Override on my authority. ID 2317.
01:22:34.282,01:22:35.533,"Lay it on me, doc."
01:22:35.617,01:22:37.452,Pansystemic necrosis.
01:22:37.577,01:22:40.205,"Progressive organ failure. Cause, unknown."
01:22:40.580,01:22:42.999,My goofy hibernation pod. That's the cause.
01:22:43.291,01:22:46.294,-What's the treatment? -Various treatments are possible.
01:22:46.378,01:22:48.713,None will meaningfully extend the patient's life.
01:22:52.550,01:22:53.718,How long have I got?
01:22:53.802,01:22:56.513,Your end-of-life transition is already underway.
01:22:57.931,01:23:01.851,These sedatives will alleviate your suffering during these final hours.
01:23:19.536,01:23:20.537,Gus.
01:23:25.792,01:23:27.419,I need a minute.
01:24:00.201,01:24:01.953,-Gus! -Gus!
01:24:10.128,01:24:12.881,We are experiencing difficulties in flight.
01:24:13.048,01:24:16.342,"For your own safety, please return to your cabins."
01:24:19.387,01:24:22.057,-I'll go get them. -No. Stay here with me.
01:24:23.475,01:24:24.893,Sit down.
01:24:41.201,01:24:42.660,My ID.
01:24:44.454,01:24:46.915,Get you where you need to go.
01:24:48.083,01:24:49.793,Fix the ship.
01:24:50.960,01:24:53.088,Find out what's wrong with her.
01:24:56.299,01:24:57.592,How do I look?
01:24:58.676,01:25:00.470,You look magnificent.
01:25:13.274,01:25:14.317,What do we do now?
01:25:21.825,01:25:23.118,This can't be good.
01:25:26.538,01:25:28.206,I'm going back to Engineering.
01:25:28.289,01:25:29.666,Can you fix this?
01:25:30.416,01:25:31.793,I need your help.
01:25:58.903,01:25:59.779,Arthur!
01:26:15.879,01:26:16.754,Let's go.
01:26:22.886,01:26:24.554,Can't we wake up some of the crew?
01:26:24.637,01:26:25.763,It'll take them too long to recover.
01:26:25.847,01:26:27.015,We don't have that kind of time.
01:26:27.098,01:26:28.516,What are we even looking for?
01:26:29.350,01:26:32.353,Something broken. Something big.
01:26:33.396,01:26:34.647,Come on.
01:26:36.357,01:26:37.317,Is it broken?
01:26:37.400,01:26:39.611,It seems okay. What's next?
01:26:39.694,01:26:41.738,Power plant. This way.
01:26:49.829,01:26:51.414,The whole section's closed off. Something's wrong.
01:26:51.497,01:26:52.749,We're looking for wrong.
01:26:53.249,01:26:54.292,Try to open it.
01:27:08.181,01:27:09.307,Pressure fault.
01:27:09.390,01:27:11.184,Lockdown initiated.
01:27:14.270,01:27:17.398,-Please secure all doors. -Hold on!
01:27:20.026,01:27:22.612,Warning. Dangerous oxygen level.
01:27:22.695,01:27:24.656,Please secure all doors.
01:27:34.499,01:27:36.292,Dangerous oxygen level.
01:27:36.376,01:27:38.336,Please secure all doors.
01:27:42.757,01:27:43.967,Grab it!
01:27:50.848,01:27:53.518,Pressurizing cabin unsuccessful.
01:28:02.318,01:28:03.945,Pressure normalized.
01:28:09.200,01:28:11.077,A hole in the ship.
01:28:18.584,01:28:21.170,How did that even happen? The ship's supposed to be meteor-proof.
01:28:50.616,01:28:52.994,It's the reactor-control computer.
01:28:59.042,01:29:00.585,This is what hit us two years ago.
01:29:00.668,01:29:01.627,Jim...
01:29:02.712,01:29:04.213,How can we fix this?
01:29:07.800,01:29:08.843,We're gonna die.
01:29:08.926,01:29:10.636,There's replacement parts for everything.
01:29:15.558,01:29:17.477,-Light. -Sorry.
01:29:19.812,01:29:22.440,"Soon as I pull this module, the entire computer's gonna shut down."
01:29:22.523,01:29:24.359,"Well, what happens then?"
01:29:25.818,01:29:27.737,I'll get it back up as quickly as I can.
01:29:32.325,01:29:33.326,Hurry!
01:29:43.753,01:29:45.004,Venting reactor.
01:29:47.590,01:29:50.051,-But we fixed it! -Reactor vent failed.
01:29:50.134,01:29:52.470,Manual override required.
01:29:58.142,01:29:59.143,Vent failure.
01:29:59.852,01:30:01.270,-Come on! -Jim.
01:30:07.693,01:30:08.986,What does that mean?
01:30:11.239,01:30:13.074,The outer door is jammed.
01:30:13.157,01:30:16.577,"We've got to open that door and cool the reactor down, or the whole ship is gonna blow."
01:30:16.994,01:30:19.163,-How? -I got to go out there.
01:30:19.455,01:30:21.040,Open it from the outside.
01:30:22.083,01:30:23.751,"I open the door, I get clear."
01:30:24.669,01:30:27.630,-You blow that fire into space. -You get clear?
01:30:27.713,01:30:29.173,You can talk to me through this.
01:30:29.382,01:30:31.384,What happens to you when that door opens?
01:30:41.936,01:30:43.521,Heat shield. It might help.
01:30:52.738,01:30:54.282,You might need this.
01:31:07.920,01:31:09.005,It's gonna be okay.
01:31:19.307,01:31:20.349,I better go.
01:31:25.688,01:31:28.107,Jim. Jim.
01:31:31.444,01:31:32.904,Come back to me.
01:31:34.655,01:31:36.741,I can't live on the ship without you.
01:32:03.351,01:32:05.102,Temperature critical.
01:32:05.186,01:32:06.187,Ow!
01:32:18.366,01:32:19.825,What's wrong?
01:32:20.660,01:32:21.535,What's the matter?
01:32:21.619,01:32:23.246,-Are you okay? -Nothing.
01:32:23.412,01:32:24.872,-Go. -You sure?
01:32:24.956,01:32:25.831,Go.
01:32:33.965,01:32:35.049,I'm at the vent tube.
01:32:42.932,01:32:44.058,I see the door.
01:33:03.244,01:33:04.787,Containment unstable.
01:33:06.664,01:33:08.874,-Where are you? -I'm at the door.
01:33:15.256,01:33:16.424,The door won't open.
01:33:16.549,01:33:18.217,I'll have to bypass it.
01:33:25.016,01:33:26.183,Please hurry!
01:33:26.600,01:33:28.936,"-Okay, I'm trying it again. -Tell me when you're clear."
01:33:33.733,01:33:34.775,-No! -What?
01:33:36.569,01:33:37.611,What's going on?
01:33:38.321,01:33:39.196,Jim?
01:33:43.951,01:33:44.910,Jim!
01:33:45.161,01:33:46.495,The door won't stay open.
01:33:48.289,01:33:49.665,I think I have to stay here.
01:33:49.957,01:33:51.292,Hold the door open.
01:33:51.584,01:33:52.585,What?
01:33:53.085,01:33:54.003,No!
01:33:54.086,01:33:55.546,No way! Get out of there!
01:33:55.629,01:33:56.714,I can't.
01:33:57.423,01:33:58.382,Jim.
01:33:58.966,01:33:59.967,We're out of time.
01:34:11.354,01:34:12.188,Vent the reactor.
01:34:22.323,01:34:24.909,"If I open the door right now, it'll kill you!"
01:34:25.201,01:34:26.202,I'm hoping not.
01:34:26.369,01:34:28.162,Come back in. We'll think of something else.
01:34:33.250,01:34:34.126,-It's okay. -No!
01:34:34.210,01:34:36.045,-It's not okay! -Aurora...
01:34:38.381,01:34:40.216,This isn't what you said was gonna happen!
01:34:41.675,01:34:43.052,"Aurora, this ship is gonna go."
01:34:43.135,01:34:45.137,"I don't care! You die, I die."
01:34:46.222,01:34:48.849,"There are 5,000 other people on this ship, Aurora."
01:34:50.518,01:34:51.602,We have to do this.
01:34:58.025,01:35:00.194,Do it. Now.
01:35:29.014,01:35:29.890,Jim.
01:35:50.661,01:35:52.913,Rebooting process initiated.
01:36:36.707,01:36:39.293,Return to ship immediately.
01:36:43.839,01:36:45.049,It worked!
01:36:45.132,01:36:46.592,You did it! You can come in!
01:36:47.468,01:36:49.053,"Yeah, about that."
01:36:49.136,01:36:50.554,What's the matter? Are you hurt?
01:36:51.555,01:36:53.265,I got blown out of the tube.
01:36:53.349,01:36:55.017,-What? -My tether broke.
01:36:55.100,01:36:56.769,I can't get back to the ship.
01:36:57.978,01:36:59.897,I'll come out. I'll come out. I'll pull you in.
01:37:02.816,01:37:04.860,Return to ship immediately.
01:37:13.577,01:37:16.121,"Aurora, I'm sorry."
01:37:18.207,01:37:19.250,For everything.
01:37:19.333,01:37:21.210,Shut up. I'm coming.
01:37:31.011,01:37:34.014,I'd have built you a house.
01:37:38.852,01:37:40.854,I'd have read your book.
01:37:43.315,01:37:44.650,It's gonna be great.
01:38:08.716,01:38:10.009,I'm coming to get you.
01:38:35.075,01:38:35.993,Jim!
01:39:38.764,01:39:40.265,"Well, resuscitate him!"
01:39:40.349,01:39:43.644,Postmortem operations require authorized medical supervision.
01:39:46.313,01:39:47.564,Jim.
01:39:54.697,01:39:56.073,Override on my authority!
01:39:56.156,01:39:58.951,ID 1-7...
01:40:01.120,01:40:02.329,Two...
01:40:02.830,01:40:04.415,Two. Two.
01:40:06.125,01:40:08.585,2-3-1-7! ID 2-3-1-7!
01:40:12.506,01:40:13.674,Resuscitation.
01:40:19.012,01:40:21.306,Override! Do it now!
01:40:21.932,01:40:23.100,Executing.
01:41:26.163,01:41:27.456,"Hey, Jim."
01:41:57.820,01:41:58.946,Yeah.
01:42:23.387,01:42:25.180,-Thank you. -Be still.
01:42:25.722,01:42:26.890,Of course.
01:43:12.394,01:43:13.896,There's something I have to show you.
01:43:14.521,01:43:20.027,"In command mode, it turns out the Autodoc has an option called Stabilize and Suspend."
01:43:20.319,01:43:22.362,It stops all metabolic activity.
01:43:24.865,01:43:25.866,What are you saying?
01:43:26.033,01:43:29.453,"With Gus's ID, it can be like hibernation inside the Autodoc."
01:43:29.536,01:43:30.579,You can go back to sleep.
01:43:35.792,01:43:37.461,But there's only one Autodoc.
01:43:41.924,01:43:42.883,Yeah.
01:43:45.552,01:43:47.220,And you're gonna lay down in it...
01:43:48.096,01:43:49.473,And fall asleep.
01:43:50.557,01:43:52.517,And you'll wake up on Homestead II.
01:43:52.976,01:43:54.478,And you'll write your book.
01:43:56.396,01:43:57.481,You'd finish your journey.
01:43:57.564,01:43:59.399,You'd do what you set out to do.
01:44:08.158,01:44:09.534,You'd be alone.
01:44:11.036,01:44:12.746,I've been alone before.
01:44:13.288,01:44:14.581,And I'll be fine.
01:44:16.291,01:44:18.085,But I would never see you again.
01:44:21.880,01:44:23.048,I'll come and visit you.
01:45:11.847,01:45:14.141,"Thank you, Arthur. You're looking very well yourself."
01:45:14.224,01:45:15.475,Thanks to you.
01:45:17.185,01:45:18.103,What's that?
01:45:20.647,01:45:22.816,Something I've wanted to give you for a long time.
01:45:29.990,01:45:31.408,It's beautiful.
01:45:44.671,01:45:46.715,Took you long enough to ask.
01:45:49.968,01:45:51.219,Champagne.
01:45:51.887,01:45:52.929,I'll wait.
01:46:53.573,01:46:58.703,"if you're reading this, then the Starship Avalon has reached its destination."
01:47:10.674,01:47:19.057,"A friend once said, You can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be that you forget to make the most of where you are."
01:47:19.933,01:47:21.935,We got lost along the way.
01:47:22.936,01:47:24.604,But we found each other.
01:47:25.397,01:47:26.898,And we made a life.
01:47:27.274,01:47:28.900,A beautiful life.
01:47:29.943,01:47:30.902,Together.
