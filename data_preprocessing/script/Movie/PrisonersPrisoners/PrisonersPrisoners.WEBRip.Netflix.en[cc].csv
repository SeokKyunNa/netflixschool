00:00:45.128,00:00:50.258,"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
00:00:52.135,00:01:02.312,"Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us."
00:01:04.314,00:01:09.402,"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
00:01:11.112,00:01:18.745,"For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever."
00:01:19.204,00:01:21.331,Amen.
00:01:40.600,00:01:42.685,and with lows in the upper 20s.
00:01:42.769,00:01:45.522,There will likely be some refreeze on some of the roads.
00:01:45.605,00:01:53.154,"So, slick spots are possible tonight in isolated low-- You know the most important thing your granddad ever taught me?"
00:01:54.489,00:01:55.657,Hmm?
00:01:58.701,00:01:59.869,Be ready.
00:02:02.580,00:02:06.501,"Hurricane, flood, whatever it ends up being."
00:02:07.544,00:02:11.089,"No more food gets delivered to the grocery store, gas stations dry up."
00:02:12.340,00:02:14.050,"People just turn on each other, and, uh..."
00:02:16.052,00:02:19.889,"All of a sudden, all that stands between you and being dead is you."
00:02:25.812,00:02:27.230,"I'm proud of you, son."
00:02:28.565,00:02:30.233,It was a nice shot.
00:03:30.001,00:03:31.711,"Wait, wait, wait. I forgot something."
00:03:31.794,00:03:32.921,"Hold on a second, Anna!"
00:03:39.928,00:03:41.221,Are we taking the truck?
00:03:41.304,00:03:42.972,"We're going up the street, you dope."
00:03:46.643,00:03:47.810,Come on.
00:03:52.398,00:03:53.858,Give me a ride.
00:03:53.942,00:03:54.984,Here.
00:04:02.575,00:04:04.744,I got half of what I need saved from the summer.
00:04:04.827,00:04:06.371,-I thought maybe you'd-- -Forget it.
00:04:06.454,00:04:09.207,I can barely get enough carpentry work to keep up with the mortgage.
00:04:10.458,00:04:12.961,"Well, why don't you rent out grandpa's old apartment house?"
00:04:14.587,00:04:18.424,"Like I keep telling your mother, it's an old building, and it'll cost a fortune to fix it up."
00:04:41.614,00:04:43.574,-Happy Thanksgiving. -Happy Thanksgiving.
00:04:45.076,00:04:46.202,"Oh, for God's sake, Keller. Get the hell in here."
00:04:51.749,00:04:53.501,"Keller, you got the deer you shot?"
00:04:53.584,00:04:55.003,-This one's Ralph's. -Yeah.
00:04:55.086,00:04:56.713,"Well, you killed it, you take it into the kitchen."
00:04:56.796,00:04:57.839,Thank you.
00:04:57.922,00:04:59.465,-Happy Thanksgiving. -Happy Thanksgiving.
00:05:02.719,00:05:06.222,"All right. Joy. Joy, three times."
00:05:06.306,00:05:09.434,"-Joy, get your dolls off the table. -Y'all missing the game."
00:05:10.977,00:05:12.729,Hey. Happy Thanksgiving.
00:05:12.812,00:05:14.230,"Anna, come here."
00:05:15.273,00:05:16.941,We wait until we're invited. You understand?
00:05:19.986,00:05:22.655,Us veterinarians make lousy butchers.
00:05:27.243,00:05:28.995,Can I go outside with Joy?
00:05:29.078,00:05:32.081,"Uh, convince your brother to go with you, and you can."
00:05:32.165,00:05:33.541,All right.
00:05:34.334,00:05:35.793,"And wear a hat, please."
00:05:35.877,00:05:37.378,You're just getting over a cold.
00:05:37.462,00:05:38.838,"Joy, you wear a hat, too."
00:05:48.598,00:05:50.558,That's... that's what my dad says.
00:05:50.641,00:05:53.644,"And the deer, if they have too many babies, then the babies starve anyway."
00:05:53.728,00:05:55.688,-You gotta keep the population down. -Right.
00:05:57.106,00:05:58.316,"Your dad say that, too?"
00:06:00.526,00:06:02.612,"Hey, hey! Get away from that thing!"
00:06:02.695,00:06:04.363,Let me see that.
00:06:04.447,00:06:06.491,"-Come on, let's go. -No."
00:06:06.574,00:06:08.451,"I said let's go! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
00:06:08.534,00:06:10.703,Stop. You can't just take somebody's stuff like that.
00:06:10.787,00:06:12.038,No! Let's go!
00:06:12.121,00:06:13.206,"Come on. Come on, come on, come on."
00:06:14.457,00:06:16.501,Wait. Shh. You hear that?
00:06:18.002,00:06:19.545,Somebody's in there.
00:06:20.129,00:06:21.756,"All right, I don't feel like getting yelled at."
00:06:21.839,00:06:23.216,"Let's go. Not on Thanksgiving, okay?"
00:06:36.562,00:06:38.523,there's no money for new marching-band uniforms.
00:06:38.606,00:06:42.360,"These kids are wearin' the same uniforms they had when we went there, and they were old then."
00:06:45.655,00:06:47.782,Why isn't he speaking to me?
00:06:47.865,00:06:49.283,He doesn't speak.
00:06:50.952,00:06:52.703,-Cutie pie. -Mm-hmm.
00:06:52.787,00:06:54.205,"-Oh, my gosh! -Whoa."
00:06:54.288,00:06:56.040,"He's fast, too."
00:06:57.041,00:06:59.460,He's so quick. Is that a slide?
00:06:59.544,00:07:02.421,"Thank you, all. Thank you, all. Got a surprise."
00:07:02.505,00:07:03.714,Oh.
00:07:04.799,00:07:07.844,And I am taking requests.
00:07:07.927,00:07:09.679,-Yes! -No.
00:07:12.140,00:07:15.143,"You gotta listen out for it, 'cause this is not easy."
00:07:15.226,00:07:18.521,"Mom. Mommy, can I take Joy to our house?"
00:07:18.604,00:07:19.689,Why?
00:07:19.772,00:07:22.066,My red whistle. She's gonna help me look for it.
00:07:22.150,00:07:24.861,"Oh, my sweetheart, I think that red whistle is long gone."
00:07:24.944,00:07:26.279,What whistle?
00:07:26.362,00:07:28.322,The emergency whistle Daddy gave me.
00:07:28.406,00:07:29.574,I lost it...
00:07:31.742,00:07:33.411,...133 days ago.
00:07:36.873,00:07:38.666,you have to whistle for it.
00:07:39.292,00:07:41.085,So we'll do Jingle Bells to find it.
00:07:54.056,00:07:57.226,"Yay! Okay! Okay! You can go, all right?"
00:07:57.310,00:07:59.687,"Just make sure Eliza and Ralph go with you, please."
00:08:03.232,00:08:06.444,Y'all eardrums are just startin' to grow. I don't want to damage them yet.
00:08:06.527,00:08:08.404,"But I am taking requests from you, Keller."
00:08:08.488,00:08:10.364,"-From me? -Your day, your request."
00:08:10.448,00:08:12.033,"Oh. Uh, the piano."
00:08:13.826,00:08:15.119,"-No, no, no. -So, all set?"
00:08:15.203,00:08:17.747,"Wait, listen, he used to love-- He used to dress like Springsteen."
00:08:17.830,00:08:19.707,-Really? -I still love Springsteen.
00:08:21.167,00:08:24.504,"Well, I ain't white, and I like him too much."
00:08:27.006,00:08:28.257,Thank you.
00:08:28.341,00:08:29.592,-Honey? -What else?
00:08:29.675,00:08:31.135,Nothing comes to mind. Nothing.
00:08:31.219,00:08:32.845,"-Oh, I know. -What?"
00:08:32.929,00:08:34.722,He actually loves The Star-Spangled Banner.
00:08:34.805,00:08:37.141,"I know. Sings it in the shower, too."
00:08:37.225,00:08:38.434,I do not.
00:09:14.095,00:09:15.721,Where are your sisters?
00:09:16.138,00:09:17.682,I can't find them.
00:09:18.683,00:09:21.185,"You, uh, you go to the house with them?"
00:09:21.269,00:09:22.937,No. What are you talking about?
00:09:23.020,00:09:25.565,-Earlier? -No.
00:09:25.648,00:09:27.525,What? They were supposed to come down earlier and get you.
00:09:27.608,00:09:29.193,They didn't come get you?
00:09:29.277,00:09:30.861,No. We haven't seen them since we ate.
00:09:30.945,00:09:33.531,It's all right. All right. They're probably at our house.
00:09:53.009,00:09:54.176,Anna?
00:09:55.720,00:09:56.887,Girls?
00:10:16.657,00:10:17.908,Girls?
00:10:18.784,00:10:19.869,Who put these dishes in here?
00:10:19.952,00:10:21.454,-Get outta here. -They weren't outside.
00:10:21.537,00:10:22.580,It's starting to rain.
00:10:22.663,00:10:25.291,-Did you check over by Maria's swing? -Yeah.
00:10:26.167,00:10:28.002,"Well, they're gettin' whupped when they get here."
00:10:28.085,00:10:29.795,"Sorry, Grace. I whup kids."
00:10:34.008,00:10:35.593,-No. They're not here. -They weren't there?
00:10:35.676,00:10:38.054,"No, they're not at our house. No, they're not there."
00:10:38.137,00:10:39.889,I checked the entire house. They're not here.
00:10:42.350,00:10:44.769,-The... the... the RV. -What RV?
00:10:44.852,00:10:47.355,"Dad, there was this RV, and they were playing on it."
00:10:47.438,00:10:49.357,We thought there was someone inside.
00:10:49.440,00:10:52.526,Where? Where was it? Show me.
00:10:53.319,00:10:54.654,You wait here.
00:10:54.737,00:10:55.988,I'm gonna go over the house again.
00:11:03.162,00:11:04.246,Anna?
00:11:04.705,00:11:05.790,Joy!
00:11:09.919,00:11:11.921,"Roger, you seen my daughter walk by here?"
00:11:12.004,00:11:13.422,No. Is there a problem?
00:11:17.343,00:11:18.427,Anna?
00:11:18.511,00:11:19.595,Here!
00:11:19.678,00:11:21.389,"Dad, it was parked right here."
00:11:24.433,00:11:26.977,Anna? Anna?
00:11:29.563,00:11:30.564,"Hello, hello!"
00:11:30.648,00:11:31.565,-Did you see 'em? -No!
00:11:31.649,00:11:32.942,Hello!
00:11:34.151,00:11:35.653,I couldn't find 'em!
00:11:36.404,00:11:38.531,-Were you messing around in this house? -No.
00:11:38.614,00:11:39.824,-I told you not to come here. -We weren't.
00:11:39.907,00:11:41.700,"They were just on the RV, and we got them off of it."
00:11:41.784,00:11:43.160,Tell me everything you remember about that RV.
00:11:43.244,00:11:44.662,-Everything. -A...a ladder on the back.
00:11:44.745,00:11:46.872,"Police, police."
00:11:59.927,00:12:01.720,Happy Thanksgiving.
00:12:01.804,00:12:03.222,Thanks.
00:12:03.639,00:12:06.392,"Hey, you have any of those, um, fortune-cookie things?"
00:12:06.475,00:12:08.853,My boss told me cops don't like fortune cookies.
00:12:10.271,00:12:11.814,What year were you born?
00:12:11.897,00:12:14.233,Are you a dragon or a snake or a horse?
00:12:14.316,00:12:15.651,I'm a monkey.
00:12:16.277,00:12:17.570,"Oh, you're a monkey."
00:12:21.574,00:12:24.618,You have an ability to influence people.
00:12:24.702,00:12:27.621,Think maybe you could influence your boss to lower the check a little bit?
00:12:30.458,00:12:32.209,My boss is a rooster.
00:12:38.841,00:12:40.301,"Silly, selfish, and eccentric."
00:12:40.384,00:12:41.552,That's...
00:12:49.185,00:12:51.770,an RV was reported matching the description.
00:12:51.854,00:12:56.567,"The vehicle is parked at a rest stop off of route 46, northbound, past exit 17."
00:12:56.650,00:12:58.110,Any available units?
00:13:02.698,00:13:04.867,This is 13-40. I'm five minutes out.
00:13:04.950,00:13:06.744,I'll meet the responding units.
00:13:30.226,00:13:33.562,"13-40. I'm on scene. Be advised, we're moving in."
00:14:13.018,00:14:15.854,"Whoa! Hey, don't move! Hey!"
00:14:15.938,00:14:18.065,"Whoa, whoa, watch out!"
00:14:19.775,00:14:21.110,Don't shoot!
00:14:23.112,00:14:24.238,Don't shoot!
00:14:24.613,00:14:25.781,Don't shoot!
00:14:33.372,00:14:35.374,"All right, let's go, take the right!"
00:14:50.598,00:14:51.765,Clear!
00:14:55.311,00:14:57.271,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! I got this."
00:14:58.272,00:14:59.440,Give me that.
00:15:20.794,00:15:21.670,Hey.
00:15:22.338,00:15:24.131,Hey. I see you in there.
00:15:24.214,00:15:26.008,Show me both your hands right now.
00:15:26.091,00:15:28.928,"Hey, I see you in there! Show me your hands!"
00:15:31.180,00:15:32.932,Both hands right now!
00:15:33.933,00:15:36.101,That's it. Slow. Slow. Slow!
00:15:36.185,00:15:38.479,Slow. Slowly. Both hands.
00:15:39.772,00:15:41.398,Both fuckin' hands!
00:15:44.276,00:15:46.070,Walk! Walk!
00:15:47.655,00:15:48.697,Hey!
00:15:49.657,00:15:50.866,Walk!
00:15:50.950,00:15:52.826,Get up! Get up!
00:15:54.286,00:15:55.788,Get up!
00:15:56.246,00:15:57.623,Show me those girls!
00:15:57.706,00:15:59.416,"Show me where you put those girls, huh?"
00:16:00.334,00:16:01.835,Where are those girls?
00:16:02.461,00:16:03.796,Where are those girls?
00:16:06.507,00:16:08.008,"Show me where those girls, they in the woods?"
00:16:08.550,00:16:10.052,You put them in the woods?
00:16:11.762,00:16:13.722,Where did you put those girls?
00:16:15.933,00:16:17.476,You hear me?
00:16:19.269,00:16:20.938,What the fuck is this guy on?
00:16:21.647,00:16:23.273,He's high on something.
00:16:23.357,00:16:24.900,Put this fucking guy in the car.
00:16:24.984,00:16:27.027,Get him in the car. Put him in the fucking car!
00:16:27.111,00:16:28.028,-Walk! -Let's go.
00:16:29.446,00:16:32.366,"Hey, call PSP, tell 'em to send their scent dogs."
00:16:32.449,00:16:34.243,And seal off the whole area.
00:16:34.326,00:16:35.869,"The entrance, all of it."
00:16:37.162,00:16:38.706,"You, come with me."
00:16:39.498,00:16:41.917,"No, they weren't playing on your RV?"
00:16:42.001,00:16:43.168,No.
00:16:49.466,00:16:51.468,"Okay, take a look at 'em again."
00:16:53.178,00:16:54.513,Don't recognize these girls?
00:16:54.596,00:16:56.724,I didn't see them. May I sit down?
00:16:56.807,00:16:58.684,What do you do in the RV? Answer my question.
00:16:59.852,00:17:01.311,You sleep in there?
00:17:01.395,00:17:02.479,You were sleeping out there?
00:17:02.563,00:17:04.106,In the day?
00:17:04.189,00:17:06.775,Why was the RV parked outside the house?
00:17:06.859,00:17:08.861,Hmm.
00:17:08.944,00:17:10.654,I went for a drive?
00:17:11.905,00:17:14.074,You went for a drive? You weren't driving.
00:17:14.908,00:17:16.952,I know for a fact those girls were playing outside your RV.
00:17:17.036,00:17:18.454,You weren't driving. It was parked.
00:17:18.537,00:17:20.247,Was it a special day?
00:17:20.330,00:17:21.790,Were you planning on taking two little girls?
00:17:21.874,00:17:22.875,No.
00:17:22.958,00:17:24.710,-Have you done that before? -No.
00:17:26.295,00:17:28.255,-Did you ask them to come inside? -No.
00:17:28.338,00:17:30.466,You ask them to come inside the RV and then you take them away?
00:17:32.801,00:17:33.761,-May I sit down? -Come on.
00:17:33.844,00:17:35.554,-Did you put those girls somewhere? -Please don't touch me.
00:17:35.637,00:17:36.930,I know you put those girls somewhere.
00:17:38.724,00:17:40.100,-You hide 'em? -No.
00:17:40.184,00:17:41.810,How did you hide 'em? Do you tie 'em up?
00:17:41.894,00:17:42.895,Mm-mmm.
00:17:42.978,00:17:44.271,-Do you tie 'em up? -Mm-mm-mmm.
00:17:44.354,00:17:47.608,Huh? Hey. Hey. Hey.
00:17:50.694,00:17:52.071,"Look, I know you're a good guy, all right?"
00:17:52.154,00:17:53.781,I know you're a decent guy.
00:17:53.864,00:17:55.491,I'm not tryin' to tell you you're doing anything bad.
00:17:55.574,00:17:57.493,"I'm just tryin' to get the right answers out of you, okay?"
00:17:57.576,00:17:59.119,The real ones. That's all I want.
00:17:59.828,00:18:02.289,"Where do you usually park your RV, Alex?"
00:18:02.831,00:18:04.875,-My aunt's house. -Your aunt's house?
00:18:04.958,00:18:06.919,She lets me park it in the backyard.
00:18:07.002,00:18:09.671,The grass don't grow back there anyway.
00:18:14.259,00:18:16.303,"For sale, if you want it."
00:18:21.016,00:18:22.434,"No, thanks."
00:18:23.102,00:18:25.813,"Well, would you tell me what you're doin' on my property then?"
00:18:28.899,00:18:32.152,I'm just glad to know where he is.
00:18:32.236,00:18:35.614,"He's always home before dark, and..."
00:18:36.365,00:18:37.533,I just don't understand.
00:18:37.616,00:18:40.828,"That boy has never been in trouble, not a day in his life."
00:18:42.246,00:18:51.880,"Uh, in the summertime, he sleeps out in the camper some, but this time of year, he sleeps in here on the sofa bed."
00:19:01.098,00:19:03.475,That's my husband.
00:19:03.559,00:19:07.229,"We had a fight, jeez, five years ago."
00:19:09.439,00:19:11.692,"Walked out, didn't come back."
00:19:13.360,00:19:15.696,Alex loved him like a father.
00:19:19.032,00:19:21.493,Where are Alex's real parents?
00:19:21.577,00:19:27.207,"My husband's brother and his girlfriend, they died in a car accident when Alex was about six."
00:19:28.083,00:19:29.209,Sorry to hear that.
00:19:39.595,00:19:41.346,He doesn't have much.
00:19:48.562,00:19:49.730,What have you got?
00:19:50.314,00:19:51.857,"Well, this thing's clean."
00:19:51.940,00:19:54.818,"I mean, it's filthy as shit, but we didn't find anything."
00:19:54.902,00:19:57.696,"We didn't find any, uh, wool fibers, anything like that?"
00:19:57.779,00:20:01.491,The girls could be wearing some wool gloves or wool hat.
00:20:01.575,00:20:02.701,No cotton fibers?
00:20:02.784,00:20:05.454,"Well, if he was just usin' this thing to transport 'em, I might buy that."
00:20:05.537,00:20:08.707,"But if there had been a struggle, I would have found something."
00:20:08.790,00:20:10.667,I'd start lookin' in the woods by the rest stop.
00:20:11.919,00:20:15.088,Yeah. Half the uniformed cops in the state are doin' that right now.
00:20:16.506,00:20:19.676,"When you're done with this thing, can you send a crew over to the aunt's house?"
00:20:42.324,00:20:43.408,Anna!
00:20:49.998,00:20:51.416,Anna!
00:21:24.074,00:21:25.742,My wife's in here.
00:21:26.827,00:21:28.537,Honey?
00:21:28.620,00:21:30.205,Her name's Nancy.
00:21:30.622,00:21:32.624,Detective Loki is-- Honey?
00:21:40.340,00:21:43.302,These photos are better than the ones my husband gave you.
00:21:43.385,00:21:45.595,You can see her eyes more clearly.
00:22:16.501,00:22:18.128,"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
00:22:19.129,00:22:20.630,The poly thing.
00:22:20.714,00:22:22.549,The lie detector we took this morning.
00:22:22.632,00:22:23.925,Did we pass?
00:22:25.177,00:22:26.595,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry."
00:22:28.346,00:22:30.599,"Yes, we appreciate your cooperation."
00:22:33.060,00:22:35.562,"It's embarrassing, all the... all this fuss."
00:22:37.606,00:22:41.818,"Everyone's gonna think we're crazy when those two come out of hiding, wherever they are."
00:22:43.737,00:22:46.239,Do you have some reason to believe they ran away?
00:22:46.907,00:22:47.949,No.
00:22:49.951,00:22:51.787,They're happy.
00:22:55.332,00:22:57.084,They must have run away.
00:22:58.835,00:23:00.712,I think they must have run away.
00:23:00.796,00:23:02.089,Right?
00:23:04.508,00:23:12.099,"Um, your police captain told me that you've solved every case that you've ever been assigned."
00:23:12.182,00:23:13.558,Is that right?
00:23:24.736,00:23:26.071,I am so sorry.
00:23:26.154,00:23:29.032,"Do you...do you have children, Detective?"
00:23:36.164,00:23:37.707,I'm gonna find your daughter.
00:23:40.627,00:23:44.506,We believe that they came back here after they left you at the Birches' yesterday.
00:23:44.589,00:23:46.383,They were looking for Anna's red whistle.
00:23:47.509,00:23:48.844,Right.
00:23:49.511,00:23:50.720,I read your statement.
00:23:52.389,00:23:53.640,I'm Detective Loki.
00:23:54.933,00:23:57.811,I'm heading up the investigation into your daughter's disappearance.
00:23:57.894,00:23:59.271,Please sit down.
00:24:01.022,00:24:07.612,"Uh, uh, my son already told you that the guy was inside the RV just watchin' 'em, right?"
00:24:08.822,00:24:11.199,We haven't found any physical evidence inside the RV.
00:24:11.867,00:24:13.368,Or his aunt's house where he lives.
00:24:14.578,00:24:15.954,Nothing?
00:24:16.037,00:24:19.708,Alex Jones unfortunately has the I.Q. of a ten-year-old.
00:24:20.542,00:24:27.841,There is no way that someone with the I.Q. of a ten-year-old could abduct two girls in broad daylight and then somehow make them disappear.
00:24:28.842,00:24:30.802,"Uh, well, how can he drive an RV?"
00:24:32.345,00:24:34.514,If he can't answer a question...
00:24:34.598,00:24:37.350,"Well, he has a legal Pennsylvania license."
00:24:37.434,00:24:40.020,"And he ran, right? They said he tried to run away."
00:24:40.103,00:24:44.065,Why... Why... Why would he run?
00:24:44.149,00:24:46.151,I've just spent ten hours questioning this boy. Okay?
00:24:46.234,00:24:47.986,I hear what you're saying.
00:24:48.904,00:24:53.366,Uh... Did... Did you give him a lie detector?
00:24:53.450,00:24:55.535,You gave us a lie detector. Did you give him one?
00:24:55.619,00:24:57.913,"Sir, I understand what you're asking me. Yes, we did."
00:24:57.996,00:25:05.462,"We gave him a lie detector, and there is no way of-- A lie detector doesn't work if you don't understand the questions."
00:25:05.545,00:25:08.256,"Well, maybe he wasn't on his own."
00:25:08.632,00:25:11.593,How could he drive an RV if he has an I.Q. of a ten-year-old?
00:25:11.676,00:25:13.345,"Hey, we're considering all possibilities."
00:25:13.428,00:25:15.347,I don't think you are considering all possibilities.
00:25:15.430,00:25:16.640,-I hear what you're saying. Sir... Sir-- -You listen to me.
00:25:16.723,00:25:18.642,Just shut the fuck up for a fucking second!
00:25:20.977,00:25:22.395,This is what I'm gonna need you to do for me.
00:25:22.479,00:25:23.939,I need you to calm down.
00:25:26.066,00:25:27.776,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
00:25:28.485,00:25:30.403,Please listen to me for a second.
00:25:30.487,00:25:32.906,"Mr. Dover, I understand this is an incredibly hard time."
00:25:32.989,00:25:36.826,But I have every uniformed police officer in this state looking for Anna.
00:25:37.410,00:25:38.912,I don't understand what any of this means.
00:25:38.995,00:25:42.165,They said he ran. They said he tried to get away.
00:25:42.249,00:25:45.335,I don't understand why he would try to run away.
00:25:47.587,00:25:50.548,"We're considering all possibilities, Mr. Dover."
00:25:50.632,00:25:52.300,I hear what you're saying.
00:25:52.384,00:25:54.678,I'm not crossing anybody off my list.
00:25:54.761,00:25:57.847,Just let me do my job.
00:26:11.611,00:26:12.737,Hey!
00:26:13.697,00:26:15.156,Detective!
00:26:16.199,00:26:17.909,"-Oh, shit. -Hey!"
00:26:18.618,00:26:21.121,"He stays in custody until my daughter's found, right?"
00:26:22.122,00:26:23.456,Right?
00:26:23.540,00:26:26.501,We have a 48-hour hold on him that ends tomorrow unless we bring charges.
00:26:26.584,00:26:28.878,"Well, charge him with something. Charge him."
00:26:30.380,00:26:36.928,"Mr. Dover, I understand what you're-- Detective, Detective, two little girls have got to be worth whatever little rule you've got to break to keep that asshole in custody."
00:26:37.012,00:26:38.638,"Now, I know you can't promise me anything."
00:26:38.722,00:26:39.723,I understand that.
00:26:39.806,00:26:42.600,But I'm asking you to be 100% sure.
00:26:44.227,00:26:45.395,Thank you.
00:26:47.022,00:26:48.315,I appreciate it.
00:26:53.153,00:26:54.612,but you want to keep holding him?
00:26:54.696,00:26:56.740,Anna Dover's father was on my ass this morning.
00:26:56.823,00:26:58.616,I get it. I understand. But it's not gonna happen.
00:26:58.700,00:27:01.369,-I was asking for one more day. -Fuck you.
00:27:01.453,00:27:02.662,"No, no."
00:27:02.746,00:27:04.164,"You find his daughter, he'll forgive you."
00:27:04.247,00:27:05.582,"You don't, he's gonna hate you anyway."
00:27:06.458,00:27:07.709,"So, what's next?"
00:27:08.793,00:27:10.712,I'm knockin' on doors all night.
00:27:10.795,00:27:14.674,"Yeah, well, you're comin' up on 24 hours missing, and you have exactly shit."
00:27:14.758,00:27:18.511,"No, I've got nine level-three sex offenders living within a ten-mile radius of Fairmont Circle."
00:27:18.595,00:27:20.889,So if you don't mind-- -Then go. -Yeah.
00:27:33.193,00:27:34.652,It's right here.
00:27:46.081,00:27:48.208,"Well, hey, look. Look, I know you're..."
00:27:50.752,00:27:52.670,"You like yourself some German porn, huh?"
00:27:52.754,00:27:53.922,"Look, I was..."
00:28:30.458,00:28:33.169,Father! Open up! It's the police!
00:29:10.915,00:29:12.375,Father.
00:29:17.714,00:29:19.132,Father.
00:29:24.637,00:29:26.639,You mind if I take a look around?
00:29:52.582,00:29:54.083,Fuckin' drunk.
00:30:12.018,00:30:13.478,What the fuck?
00:30:18.358,00:30:19.567,Whoa.
00:30:26.866,00:30:28.201,Fuck.
00:30:56.229,00:30:57.105,Aye. Fuck.
00:32:11.179,00:32:13.139,"What's the name of your buddy down there, huh?"
00:32:13.222,00:32:15.058,"-What's the name, huh? -I don't know his name."
00:32:15.141,00:32:17.477,-You don't know his name? -I don't know his name.
00:32:17.560,00:32:18.478,"Hey, you know what?"
00:32:18.561,00:32:20.480,"I spent six years in Huntington Boy's Home, Father."
00:32:20.563,00:32:23.107,"You know the Huntington Boy's Home, right? Huh?"
00:32:23.191,00:32:24.859,Hurting a fuck like you'd be a real treat for me.
00:32:24.943,00:32:26.194,Why don't you tell me his fuckin' name?
00:32:28.571,00:32:30.990,He came to me for confession.
00:32:31.074,00:32:34.619,He said he'd killed 16 children. He bragged about it.
00:32:35.328,00:32:37.538,I convinced him to come back here.
00:32:37.622,00:32:39.290,He said he'd kill more.
00:32:39.374,00:32:40.583,"Sixteen children, huh?"
00:32:42.460,00:32:43.711,"Let's go, you fucking chicken-hawk!"
00:33:17.996,00:33:19.080,Hey.
00:33:20.623,00:33:22.208,-What? -The man.
00:33:22.291,00:33:24.502,The police said they're letting him go today.
00:33:24.585,00:33:26.462,Okay. I'll take care of it.
00:33:30.800,00:33:32.593,Where are you goin'?
00:33:48.359,00:33:49.569,That's good.
00:33:55.283,00:33:57.452,Mm-hmm. Good job.
00:33:57.535,00:33:59.203,Now you give it to the man.
00:34:08.629,00:34:09.672,All right. Come on.
00:34:09.756,00:34:12.133,I don't want you minding these people out here.
00:34:15.178,00:34:17.847,Don't talk to them. You've got nothing to say to them. Come on.
00:34:35.281,00:34:36.657,-Sir-- -I just want to talk.
00:34:36.741,00:34:38.034,"He's a free man, I'm a free man!"
00:34:41.204,00:34:43.122,Hey! Tell me what you did with them!
00:34:43.873,00:34:44.874,Tell me!
00:34:44.957,00:34:46.626,They didn't cry until I left them.
00:34:46.709,00:34:48.461,What did you say? What did you say?
00:34:48.544,00:34:50.088,"Whoa, no, no!"
00:34:53.633,00:34:55.093,God! Get up.
00:34:55.176,00:34:56.677,Get him down! Get him down!
00:35:02.100,00:35:03.309,We're fine. Thank you.
00:35:10.024,00:35:13.778,"Now, I know your dad was a guard at Graterford."
00:35:14.779,00:35:19.742,"And I've got a daughter of my own, so we're gonna pretend this never happened."
00:35:20.827,00:35:23.871,"And as for Alex Jones, he has orders not to leave the commonwealth."
00:35:24.747,00:35:26.124,What?
00:35:26.207,00:35:29.252,"Sir, I need you to go home. All right?"
00:35:29.335,00:35:30.670,I need you to go home to your family.
00:35:30.753,00:35:31.838,What about what I just fucking told you?
00:35:31.921,00:35:33.548,Why aren't you sending someone out to go arrest this guy?
00:35:33.631,00:35:37.009,Tell Detective Loki what you just told me and he'll definitely look into it.
00:35:37.093,00:35:38.469,Go ahead.
00:35:39.387,00:35:42.807,"That asshole you promised me you'd keep in custody, right?"
00:35:42.890,00:35:44.308,And you didn't.
00:35:44.392,00:35:48.980,"And right now, when I grabbed him in the parking lot, he said right to my fucking face, They didn't cry until I left them."
00:35:49.063,00:35:50.773,Right to my fucking face.
00:35:50.857,00:35:52.692,He said that to you in the parking lot just now?
00:35:52.775,00:35:54.485,"Right now, yeah. What did I just say?"
00:35:54.569,00:35:55.820,In the parking lot.
00:35:55.903,00:35:57.321,Before you grabbed me off him.
00:35:59.365,00:36:01.492,Did anyone else hear it besides you?
00:36:01.576,00:36:03.369,I don't know. It was quiet.
00:36:03.452,00:36:06.205,He... He said it to me. He wanted me to know.
00:36:06.289,00:36:07.874,-Are you sure he said that? -What?
00:36:08.666,00:36:10.042,Are you sure that's what he said?
00:36:10.793,00:36:12.795,"Jesus Christ, you think I'm makin' this up?"
00:36:13.337,00:36:14.505,-No. -Why would I make this up?
00:36:14.589,00:36:16.716,"-Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa. -No, think about it."
00:36:16.799,00:36:19.218,-Why would I make this up? -I'm not saying that to you.
00:36:19.302,00:36:21.262,I'm just asking you a couple questions.
00:36:21.345,00:36:22.722,I will talk to him.
00:36:22.805,00:36:26.058,"-No, don't talk to him! -Mr. Dover-- Arrest him!"
00:36:28.978,00:36:30.813,What did I fuckin' tell you?
00:36:31.314,00:36:33.441,What'd I tell you? One more day.
00:36:37.236,00:36:38.654,in the parking lot today?
00:36:40.990,00:36:42.950,Anything he could have misinterpreted or...
00:36:44.535,00:36:46.037,I was right there.
00:36:46.120,00:36:49.498,They didn't say anything to each other. Man just attacked the boy.
00:36:50.958,00:36:54.212,Nothing like Get away from me or Help or...
00:36:55.254,00:36:56.339,Anything like that?
00:36:58.216,00:36:59.425,No.
00:37:03.012,00:37:04.597,Can I speak to Alex alone for a minute?
00:37:09.310,00:37:11.103,"It's all right, sweetie."
00:37:11.187,00:37:12.730,I'll be right in the next room.
00:37:25.159,00:37:27.119,"You love your aunt, don't you, Alex?"
00:37:33.209,00:37:34.502,Yes.
00:37:35.169,00:37:39.006,You know if you know something you're not telling us that she could go to jail for a very long time.
00:37:39.840,00:37:41.634,Do you want that for her?
00:37:43.427,00:37:45.304,After everything she's done for you?
00:37:46.597,00:37:47.807,No.
00:38:03.614,00:38:05.324,"Mr. Dover, this is Detective Loki."
00:38:06.575,00:38:07.910,Have you arrested him?
00:38:08.369,00:38:12.540,"Yeah, look, I just came from Alex Jones, and he said he didn't say anything to you in the parking lot."
00:38:12.623,00:38:14.333,"I pushed him pretty hard, and he didn't budge."
00:38:14.417,00:38:16.294,"So, look, we can't waste any more time on this guy."
00:38:16.377,00:38:17.878,All right? You're gonna have to trust me.
00:38:17.962,00:38:24.468,"I'll let you know if I have anything new, all right, for the-- Fuckin' A."
00:38:41.360,00:38:44.447,and I told her it didn't matter 'cause we were just gonna go right down the street.
00:38:44.530,00:38:45.740,"No, no."
00:38:46.157,00:38:48.075,Why hasn't she come home?
00:38:48.951,00:38:50.286,It's been three days.
00:38:50.619,00:38:53.831,Why can't you make her come home?
00:38:55.624,00:38:57.501,I don't understand.
00:38:58.294,00:39:01.672,I don't understand. It's been too long.
00:39:02.631,00:39:05.051,Please make her come home.
00:39:06.969,00:39:08.387,-Please make her-- -How many of these?
00:39:09.472,00:39:10.848,How many of these?
00:39:12.016,00:39:13.476,-How many of these? -I don't know!
00:39:13.559,00:39:14.727,It's okay. It's all right.
00:39:15.144,00:39:16.479,Just take one.
00:39:17.980,00:39:19.148,Here.
00:39:20.274,00:39:21.359,No.
00:39:22.109,00:39:23.986,I just want to sleep.
00:39:24.070,00:39:26.655,I just want to go to sleep.
00:39:29.075,00:39:30.659,You...
00:39:32.036,00:39:35.039,You made me feel so safe.
00:39:39.627,00:39:43.506,You told us that you could protect us from everything.
00:39:45.341,00:39:46.884,"Oh, God..."
00:39:51.639,00:39:54.350,I'm gonna go out and help the police. Just keep an eye on your mother.
00:39:56.394,00:39:58.396,Your sister needs us to be brave for her.
00:39:59.772,00:40:01.607,"Be brave for her. Be a grown-up for me, okay?"
00:40:01.690,00:40:02.942,Can you do that?
00:40:03.776,00:40:05.277,Can you do that?
00:40:05.361,00:40:08.030,I know you're scared. Look at me. Come here.
00:40:08.823,00:40:10.241,I know you're scared.
00:40:11.325,00:40:12.868,It's gonna be okay.
00:40:32.096,00:40:35.641,The latter why we should be very penitent when we are afflicted.
00:40:37.518,00:40:43.566,He reminds him that trouble and affliction are what we have all reason to expect in this world.
00:40:43.649,00:40:49.947,"Man is brought into trouble, not as man, but as sinful man, who was in transgression."
00:40:50.614,00:40:53.701,Man born in sin and therefore born to trouble.
00:42:42.685,00:42:44.019,"Come on, Tucker."
00:43:20.848,00:43:24.184,That song. Where did you hear those words?
00:43:26.812,00:43:28.188,Hmm?
00:43:49.960,00:43:52.004,Did you bring a change of clothes like I told you?
00:43:53.589,00:43:56.967,Yeah. You gonna tell me why?
00:43:58.427,00:43:59.887,It's better if I just show you.
00:44:02.765,00:44:04.099,Show me what?
00:44:24.912,00:44:26.455,Didn't you used to live here?
00:44:26.538,00:44:27.748,Mm-hmm.
00:44:40.344,00:44:41.929,Close the door. Lock it.
00:45:01.073,00:45:02.157,Wow.
00:45:21.802,00:45:24.721,"Oh, my God. What... What did you do?"
00:45:25.305,00:45:29.726,"Keller, what the hell-- I heard him singing the same song they were singing on Thanksgiving."
00:45:29.810,00:45:31.895,"Swear to God, Franklin. The same fucking song."
00:45:31.979,00:45:34.064,And I told you what he said in the parking lot.
00:45:34.148,00:45:37.860,"Then we take him to the police-- No, no, no. The police won't do shit."
00:45:37.943,00:45:40.279,He'll just clam up and act crazy like he did last time.
00:45:40.362,00:45:41.989,Someone has to make him talk.
00:45:42.072,00:45:43.490,Someone.
00:45:48.745,00:45:50.956,"Shit, man. This... This ain't right."
00:45:51.039,00:45:52.583,"I mean, what if you're wrong?"
00:45:52.666,00:45:54.835,-I'm not wrong. -But what if you are?
00:45:54.918,00:45:56.462,What if you only heard what you wanted to hear?
00:45:56.545,00:45:57.963,What if...
00:45:58.755,00:46:02.759,"Man, I want my daughter back as much as you do, -but this ain't right. -Franklin! Franklin!"
00:46:04.511,00:46:07.723,"We hurt him until he talks, or they're gonna die."
00:46:10.976,00:46:13.187,-This ain't-- -No! No!
00:46:14.605,00:46:17.274,We hurt him until he talks or they're gonna die.
00:46:18.400,00:46:19.943,That's the choice.
00:46:22.154,00:46:23.697,That's the choice you have to make.
00:46:24.323,00:46:25.699,I've made my choice.
00:46:26.617,00:46:27.951,I know what I heard.
00:46:33.749,00:46:35.292,He's not a person anymore.
00:46:36.210,00:46:39.254,"No, he stopped being a person when he took our daughters."
00:46:49.932,00:46:51.183,I need your help.
00:46:53.727,00:46:57.105,This is your last chance. I know you're scared.
00:46:57.189,00:46:59.233,And I know you wanna go home.
00:46:59.316,00:47:00.776,And I don't... I don't want to hurt you.
00:47:00.859,00:47:01.985,I don't.
00:47:02.069,00:47:05.280,"I'm gonna take the tape off, and I want you to tell me where they are."
00:47:26.510,00:47:28.512,Where are they?
00:47:29.638,00:47:31.306,Tell me where they are!
00:47:34.142,00:47:36.353,the house the RV was parked in front of.
00:47:36.436,00:47:38.355,It's only been on the market a couple of months.
00:47:38.438,00:47:40.649,"I'm gonna track the owners down, see if they know anything."
00:47:40.732,00:47:43.860,You got any new info on that corpse we found in the priest's basement?
00:47:47.114,00:47:48.282,Nothing?
00:47:48.365,00:47:50.534,"Priest is sticking to the story, too."
00:48:26.612,00:48:28.030,I'm sure of it.
00:48:32.868,00:48:34.870,"Wearing out the tape, I guess."
00:48:35.829,00:48:39.750,I watch it every day after breakfast. It's the only video I have of him.
00:48:42.961,00:48:44.630,It was before your time.
00:48:45.922,00:48:48.383,"Twenty-six years ago, August 19th."
00:48:49.843,00:48:53.889,"I took a nap in the afternoon, and when I woke up, Barry was gone."
00:48:55.307,00:48:57.434,No one could ever tell me what happened to him.
00:48:59.561,00:49:04.483,"He was playing in the front yard, just a few feet from where they say that RV was parked."
00:49:06.693,00:49:08.153,What do you think that means?
00:49:13.617,00:49:15.619,I'm more interested in what you think that means.
00:49:18.455,00:49:19.998,I don't think we'll ever know.
00:49:21.708,00:49:23.460,It's just like Barry.
00:49:25.462,00:49:27.255,No one took them.
00:49:27.673,00:49:29.049,Nothing happened.
00:49:30.384,00:49:31.885,They're just gone.
00:49:42.854,00:49:44.439,"How you doin', Father?"
00:49:46.566,00:49:50.153,I'm gettin' better.
00:49:51.405,00:49:56.702,"So, Detective Chemelinski tells me that you have some specifics about the crime you claim that guy committed."
00:49:57.577,00:49:59.162,The abductor.
00:49:59.621,00:50:00.914,He was...
00:50:03.667,00:50:05.794,Waging a war against God.
00:50:10.048,00:50:11.842,Great. That's great.
00:50:14.261,00:50:15.887,I thought you said he had something specific.
00:50:16.972,00:50:19.433,Tell him how he took the kids.
00:50:22.936,00:50:24.396,He said...
00:50:27.023,00:50:29.276,...he took them in daylight.
00:50:30.318,00:50:31.987,Sometimes...
00:50:34.406,00:50:36.616,...more than one child at a time.
00:50:37.868,00:50:40.036,-He said that? -Yeah.
00:50:40.996,00:50:43.165,Did he say he was with anybody?
00:50:43.749,00:50:45.041,He did it alone?
00:50:46.543,00:50:47.961,He...
00:50:48.879,00:50:50.922,He said he had a family.
00:50:57.846,00:50:58.889,That's it?
00:51:04.519,00:51:05.937,All right.
00:51:07.230,00:51:08.648,Informative.
00:51:21.912,00:51:22.871,Look at me.
00:51:22.954,00:51:25.332,You said they cried when you left them!
00:51:25.415,00:51:27.709,You said they cried when you left them!
00:51:29.127,00:51:30.420,Now tell me!
00:51:31.880,00:51:34.925,Where is she? Hmm? Hmm?
00:51:35.675,00:51:37.219,Tell me where they are!
00:51:42.849,00:51:45.685,Just tell me. Just tell me and I'll stop.
00:51:46.102,00:51:47.395,I'll stop as soon as you tell me.
00:51:53.276,00:51:54.569,Just...
00:51:55.320,00:51:57.113,Just tell me where they are.
00:52:06.456,00:52:09.125,Why won't you tell me? Huh?
00:52:14.089,00:52:16.299,Why won't you just fuckin' tell us?
00:52:30.981,00:52:32.440,He knows.
00:52:33.108,00:52:34.442,He knows.
00:52:36.611,00:52:38.905,I can see it in his eyes. He fucking knows.
00:52:40.824,00:52:42.617,I know you know!
00:52:42.701,00:52:44.786,Why aren't you fucking telling me?
00:52:47.372,00:52:48.707,Why?
00:52:53.628,00:52:54.713,Fine.
00:52:58.300,00:53:00.719,Get him up. Get him up. Get up.
00:53:01.636,00:53:04.639,Get up. Get up. Get up!
00:53:11.980,00:53:13.607,You gonna make me use this?
00:53:14.733,00:53:16.526,You gonna tell us?
00:53:16.610,00:53:18.570,"If you don't, I'm gonna use this."
00:53:20.822,00:53:21.865,Fine.
00:53:25.952,00:53:27.495,You're doing this to yourself.
00:53:28.788,00:53:31.166,Just tell us. Tell me.
00:53:33.418,00:53:34.794,Tell me!
00:53:37.297,00:53:38.173,Tell me!
00:53:38.715,00:53:41.009,Tell me! Tell me!
00:53:42.928,00:53:44.888,Where's my daughter?
00:53:44.971,00:53:47.140,Where's my daughter?
00:54:11.164,00:54:14.626,since Anna Dover and Joy Birch were last seen by their families.
00:54:14.709,00:54:20.799,"The two girls, aged six and seven, are believed to have been playing on this street when they disappeared without a trace."
00:54:20.924,00:54:25.762,"As you can see, despite the cold, a lot of people have turned out tonight to show their support."
00:54:25.845,00:54:29.224,Police are asking that anyone with any information on the girls' whereabouts...
00:54:44.614,00:54:47.200,I was searching for her in the woods.
00:55:08.346,00:55:09.472,Franklin.
00:55:10.348,00:55:12.017,"Franklin, what is it?"
00:55:12.976,00:55:15.353,I just need a minute.
00:58:38.264,00:58:39.891,Hey! Get off of me!
00:58:43.353,00:58:45.063,Hey! Hey!
00:59:05.917,00:59:07.085,Okay.
00:59:26.688,00:59:30.066,is a person of interest in the investigation of the two missing girls.
00:59:30.149,00:59:39.117,"Now, this unidentified man, who was last seen at last night's candlelight vigil, fled on foot when the investigating detective attempted to question him."
00:59:39.200,00:59:43.204,"Police caution the public not to approach this man, but to call police immediately if they do see him."
00:59:46.583,00:59:47.834,And now for the weather.
01:00:01.848,01:00:04.767,"Look, Keller, I mean, just think about it."
01:00:04.851,01:00:08.396,Why would the police be lookin' for this man if they didn't think that he did it in the first place?
01:00:08.479,01:00:10.148,They did it together. They know each other.
01:00:10.231,01:00:12.817,"Listen, I fuckin' told you, all right?"
01:00:12.900,01:00:16.321,"Jones looked me in the eye and he said, They only cried when I left them."
01:00:16.404,01:00:18.406,"He left 'em with someone, and he knows where this guy is."
01:00:24.912,01:00:28.166,Holly Jones' dog got hit on southward street.
01:00:28.249,01:00:31.711,"Apparently, Alex Jones took the dog for a walk the night before last, they never came home."
01:00:31.794,01:00:34.380,And his aunt didn't want to tell us about the dog when we called her about it this morning.
01:00:34.464,01:00:36.924,She said that she thought it would get him into trouble or some shit.
01:00:37.008,01:00:38.635,I thought you said you would keep him under surveillance.
01:00:38.718,01:00:40.637,"Yeah, and I thought you said the guy was innocent."
01:00:40.720,01:00:43.431,And I thought the guy from last night you said was our guy.
01:00:43.514,01:00:46.392,"Look, I don't have money in the budget for watching innocent people."
01:00:46.476,01:00:48.019,You said to me that you'd put him under surveillance.
01:00:48.102,01:00:50.563,-What do you want me to say? -You gonna keep your word?
01:00:50.647,01:00:52.482,"You could have just given me a call, because I would have been there all night."
01:00:52.565,01:00:54.275,I would have stayed up all night. I would know where he was now.
01:00:54.359,01:00:56.069,I need to know where everybody is.
01:00:56.152,01:00:58.112,"All right, point made. All right? Point made."
01:00:58.196,01:01:00.156,"If you can be clear with me, then I'll be clear with you."
01:01:00.239,01:01:01.366,I need to know where everybody is.
01:01:01.449,01:01:03.451,"If you're gonna do something different, please tell me."
01:01:08.247,01:01:10.083,What do you do in your RV?
01:01:13.753,01:01:15.546,...to be alone.
01:01:25.181,01:01:34.607,"Radio, tape-- The RV was parked over on Fairmont Circle?"
01:01:35.733,01:01:37.026,No.
01:01:37.110,01:01:38.611,Is my aunt coming?
01:01:45.576,01:01:47.328,Have you seen these girls?
01:01:48.329,01:01:49.330,No.
01:01:49.414,01:01:51.874,Take a look at 'em. You seen these girls?
01:01:54.836,01:01:56.170,No.
01:01:56.546,01:01:59.382,Did you participate in any way in the abduction of those girls?
01:02:01.634,01:02:03.052,No.
01:02:03.136,01:02:04.971,Loki! You got a call.
01:02:08.933,01:02:10.309,All right.
01:02:15.356,01:02:20.278,"He comes in here every week almost and buys kids' clothes, but he's always buying stuff in different sizes."
01:02:20.820,01:02:22.697,Caught him messing around with the mannequins once.
01:02:23.865,01:02:25.867,-What did he pay with? -Cash.
01:02:28.286,01:02:30.538,"All right, you give me a call if you hear anything."
01:02:30.621,01:02:31.873,Okay.
01:02:36.085,01:02:37.879,It's been five days.
01:02:38.588,01:02:41.591,Maybe five days since they had a drink of water.
01:02:43.176,01:02:45.303,This could be the last night that matters.
01:02:48.556,01:02:51.684,"Look, I'll call you after Nancy goes to sleep, all right?"
01:02:53.561,01:02:54.896,I promise.
01:03:27.220,01:03:29.096,Where have you been all this time?
01:04:01.420,01:04:02.922,What the hell were you thinking?
01:04:13.599,01:04:15.184,You tell anyone?
01:04:16.227,01:04:17.395,Did you?
01:04:22.525,01:04:24.151,I wanna see him.
01:04:52.638,01:04:53.890,Oh...
01:05:29.050,01:05:30.551,Please help me.
01:05:34.680,01:05:37.099,Could you help me find my little girl?
01:05:40.728,01:05:42.104,Got a picture.
01:05:42.772,01:05:44.065,See?
01:05:46.275,01:05:47.735,This my baby.
01:05:49.695,01:05:51.113,You see her?
01:05:51.948,01:05:53.574,Her name is Joy.
01:06:00.706,01:06:02.166,"And, um..."
01:06:04.710,01:06:08.798,A stuffed animal we got her when she was two because she's afraid to sleep by herself.
01:06:08.881,01:06:11.884,"Please, tell me where my little girl is."
01:06:11.968,01:06:14.178,Please tell me where my little girl...
01:06:21.602,01:06:23.437,I know you're gonna tell me.
01:06:23.521,01:06:25.064,I know you're gonna tell me.
01:06:25.898,01:06:26.899,I know.
01:06:45.960,01:06:47.211,Help me.
01:06:55.344,01:06:56.387,Nancy!
01:06:58.264,01:06:59.557,What the fuck you doin'?
01:07:03.978,01:07:05.688,-God damn it! -Damn!
01:07:07.481,01:07:08.941,Let it go!
01:07:09.025,01:07:10.776,Let it go!
01:07:15.156,01:07:17.241,You untied him? Huh?
01:07:29.837,01:07:31.130,That was close.
01:08:13.547,01:08:14.590,What is it? What happened?
01:08:14.673,01:08:16.717,Get Franklin. I need to show you something.
01:08:21.430,01:08:22.765,Did he say anything new?
01:08:22.848,01:08:24.850,"He will, soon. You'll see."
01:08:35.486,01:08:36.779,No light gets in.
01:08:38.656,01:08:40.533,There's barely enough room to sit down inside.
01:08:41.826,01:08:44.703,"Shower still works, but we control it from out here."
01:08:46.038,01:08:50.334,"And I rigged the water heater, so it either comes out scalding or freezing."
01:08:52.920,01:08:55.381,"And, uh, you talk to him through this."
01:08:56.549,01:08:57.550,It's to remind us...
01:08:58.884,01:09:01.011,...in case we start feeling sorry for him.
01:09:02.805,01:09:04.265,My God.
01:09:05.266,01:09:08.269,"I can't hurt him any more without killing him, so this is the only way."
01:09:09.311,01:09:11.438,"Have you lost your mind, Keller?"
01:09:12.439,01:09:14.525,"Do you have a better idea, Franklin?"
01:09:15.651,01:09:16.986,Do you?
01:09:18.863,01:09:21.699,"Go ahead. Let him out, if you want. I'm not gonna stop you."
01:09:22.908,01:09:25.494,"If that's what you really want, you go ahead."
01:09:26.203,01:09:29.957,You think someone's lookin' out for our girls the way you're lookin' out for him?
01:09:34.795,01:09:37.673,"It's been five days now, man. We're runnin' out of time."
01:09:39.633,01:09:41.093,You don't even know it's him.
01:09:41.177,01:09:42.553,"-Yeah, I do. -No, you don't."
01:09:42.636,01:09:45.014,-I do. -I know you. You don't.
01:09:47.683,01:09:54.106,"Look, I want my baby back as much as you miss Anna."
01:09:55.316,01:10:00.070,"And despite what you think about me, I would die for my daughter."
01:10:01.447,01:10:03.199,But this ain't right.
01:10:03.991,01:10:05.826,This has to stop.
01:10:08.162,01:10:10.080,"Well, then, you better get to work."
01:10:13.417,01:10:15.044,You can start with that wall there.
01:10:33.812,01:10:35.356,Franklin.
01:10:36.982,01:10:38.484,Stop.
01:10:45.824,01:10:48.661,"Franklin, think of Joy."
01:11:28.742,01:11:30.911,"I need to get out of this place, Ralph."
01:11:31.954,01:11:35.582,Everything in this house just makes me want to throw up.
01:11:38.419,01:11:40.212,Your dad's building?
01:11:41.046,01:11:43.799,There is no way I'm staying in that crackhouse.
01:11:44.633,01:11:46.010,It's disgusting.
01:11:48.929,01:11:50.389,"Yeah, okay."
01:12:14.288,01:12:17.082,"We're not gonna help Keller, but we won't stop him either."
01:12:17.583,01:12:19.752,Let him do what he needs to.
01:12:26.216,01:12:27.926,We don't know about it anymore.
01:12:56.997,01:12:58.457,Eliza?
01:13:04.380,01:13:06.298,-Excuse me. -Eliza?
01:13:08.425,01:13:10.386,"Eliza, open the door!"
01:13:11.845,01:13:12.805,Eliza?
01:13:12.888,01:13:14.264,Is she in there?
01:13:14.348,01:13:15.516,Honey?
01:13:16.308,01:13:17.518,Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
01:13:18.435,01:13:20.062,"Yeah, fuck you both!"
01:13:20.145,01:13:24.108,"Next time you plan on leaving me here alone, maybe you could try at least telling me where you're going."
01:14:28.547,01:14:29.673,Ralph?
01:14:34.928,01:14:36.305,Anna?
01:14:36.930,01:14:38.265,Anna?
01:14:41.602,01:14:42.769,Anna?
01:14:48.108,01:14:49.485,Anna?
01:14:59.786,01:15:00.787,Anna?
01:15:04.208,01:15:05.626,Mom?
01:15:11.089,01:15:12.299,Anna. Anna was here.
01:15:12.382,01:15:13.509,"Mom, it's freezing in here."
01:15:13.592,01:15:15.552,"Mom! Hey, Mom! Mom! Mom, please sit down."
01:15:15.636,01:15:17.846,Stop. Calm down. I'm gonna close the window.
01:15:24.645,01:15:28.357,"And then I heard a sound from my room, and I..."
01:15:29.274,01:15:31.735,I came in and the window was open.
01:15:32.486,01:15:34.947,And it wasn't open before.
01:15:35.030,01:15:39.618,"And then... and then, Ralph, he... he came in..."
01:15:39.993,01:15:42.579,"and he looked and, um..."
01:15:43.455,01:15:44.831,And then...
01:15:46.041,01:15:47.626,Then I don't know.
01:15:50.379,01:15:52.256,Aren't you gonna write this down?
01:16:06.061,01:16:08.855,I didn't check the basement. We need to check the basement.
01:16:08.939,01:16:10.941,I'll show you. I'll show you.
01:16:22.869,01:16:24.955,The kids know they're not allowed down here.
01:16:30.586,01:16:33.922,"They're not supposed to come down here, but I don't know..."
01:16:51.815,01:16:54.610,My husband likes to be prepared for emergencies.
01:17:01.450,01:17:02.909,"Where is your husband, Mrs. Dover?"
01:17:04.536,01:17:05.621,I was gonna ask you.
01:17:05.704,01:17:08.665,He's been out searching with the police for Anna.
01:17:08.749,01:17:10.876,Which you should be doing right now.
01:17:12.628,01:17:14.463,Does he always stay out this late?
01:17:15.631,01:17:20.969,"Yes, he stays out this late when he's looking for my daughter, since my daughter has been gone, yes!"
01:17:21.053,01:17:22.137,Shit.
01:18:48.306,01:18:49.558,"Hey, go aro..."
01:18:50.517,01:18:51.810,Go around.
01:19:49.451,01:19:51.453,"Come on, Mr. Dover."
01:19:58.293,01:19:59.628,Shit.
01:20:13.934,01:20:15.560,Why are you following me?
01:20:17.479,01:20:18.730,Get in the car.
01:20:32.244,01:20:33.495,Why are you following me?
01:20:37.582,01:20:39.167,Where did you go just now?
01:20:41.044,01:20:42.796,I parked at a liquor store.
01:20:42.879,01:20:44.339,I have a bottle of liquor.
01:20:44.422,01:20:46.675,You're the shit-hot detective. Work it out.
01:20:48.468,01:20:49.845,I actually meant before that.
01:20:51.596,01:20:55.308,You were walking in the opposite direction across the parking lot.
01:20:56.476,01:20:57.894,Towards Campello Street.
01:21:06.653,01:21:10.740,"Yeah, well, I haven't had a drink in nine-and-a-half years."
01:21:11.449,01:21:15.954,"I figured if I walked around the parking lot for a while, by the time they opened, I'd stop wanting it that bad."
01:21:16.580,01:21:18.290,"And then, uh, then I saw you."
01:21:18.999,01:21:20.959,Sorta helped me make up my mind.
01:21:27.549,01:21:30.510,There's a bag of lye in your basement that's half empty.
01:21:33.847,01:21:36.433,Your wife thinks you've been helpin' us...
01:21:39.102,01:21:40.896,but we both know that's not true.
01:21:43.398,01:21:45.775,I used the lye to bury our dog last year.
01:21:46.359,01:21:51.656,And helping the cops sounds better than I've been driving aimlessly in my truck 'cause I don't know what the fuck else to do.
01:21:51.740,01:21:53.867,Is that what you were doing last Saturday night?
01:21:55.410,01:21:56.912,Probably. Am I a suspect?
01:21:56.995,01:21:58.830,"No, I'm only asking..."
01:21:58.914,01:22:00.957,I'm only asking 'cause you assaulted a man who's now missing.
01:22:03.752,01:22:05.754,I heard about that. What happened to him?
01:22:05.837,01:22:07.005,Thought you had him under surveillance.
01:22:07.088,01:22:09.841,I'm gonna assume you're asking me because you have no idea.
01:22:09.925,01:22:11.968,"Well, I didn't think it was something I could get away with."
01:22:12.552,01:22:13.970,It's not.
01:22:14.054,01:22:17.974,"Yeah, well, it couldn't be that he skipped town 'cause the asshole is guilty. Well, it couldn't be that, right?"
01:22:21.770,01:22:23.146,Mr. Dover?
01:22:26.149,01:22:28.151,-Mr. Dover? -What?
01:22:28.234,01:22:30.904,You need to take care of yourself and your wife.
01:22:30.987,01:22:33.239,That's the best thing you can do right now.
01:22:34.407,01:22:38.036,That little girl is gonna need you when she comes home.
01:22:42.123,01:22:50.006,"Kids gone for more than a week have half as good a chance of being found, and after a month, almost none are. Not alive. All right?"
01:22:50.090,01:22:54.344,So forgive me for doing everything I can-- You know what? It hasn't been a fucking week.
01:22:54.427,01:22:56.554,-You're right. It's day fucking six! -It hasn't been a week!
01:22:56.638,01:22:58.264,Day six!
01:22:58.348,01:23:02.852,"And every day, she's wondering why I'm not there to fucking rescue her!"
01:23:02.936,01:23:04.104,-All right. -Do you understand that?
01:23:04.187,01:23:07.440,Me! Not you! Not you! But me!
01:23:08.066,01:23:09.609,-Every day! -All right.
01:23:09.693,01:23:13.780,So forgive me for not going home to have a good night's rest!
01:23:15.532,01:23:22.038,"Now, why don't you look for my fucking daughter rather than fighting-- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
01:23:22.122,01:23:24.499,"-Don't follow me. -Hey, hey."
01:23:24.582,01:23:26.418,Mr. Dover. Mr. Dover.
01:23:33.800,01:23:36.428,"You don't think I'm gonna let you get behind the wheel after you've been drinkin', do you?"
01:23:36.511,01:23:39.097,I'm gonna walk. You look for my daughter.
01:24:26.102,01:24:27.479,Daddy.
01:24:28.646,01:24:30.356,"Look, Daddy, we found it."
01:24:35.653,01:24:37.447,"Anna, where was it?"
01:26:33.563,01:26:35.231,I'm not Alex.
01:26:36.858,01:26:39.694,What? What are you saying? What? What?
01:26:40.737,01:26:43.656,I'm not Alex.
01:26:47.660,01:26:51.456,Just a second. I don't understand.
01:26:51.998,01:26:53.499,Just... Just talk to me.
01:26:53.958,01:26:57.212,"I waited, and he never came."
01:26:57.295,01:26:59.505,Come on. No more riddles.
01:26:59.589,01:27:00.924,Just fucking tell me.
01:27:01.007,01:27:08.514,He never came. I just-- I'll let you go home to your aunt if you tell me where they are.
01:27:16.231,01:27:18.316,-And he never came. -Don't make me do it.
01:27:21.110,01:27:22.987,He never came.
01:27:24.447,01:27:26.366,-I just wanted to-- -Why are you making me do this?
01:27:44.926,01:27:46.678,"Help me, God."
01:27:50.598,01:27:54.644,I'm relying on your almighty power and infinite mercies and promises.
01:27:56.229,01:27:58.606,I hope to obtain pardon for my sins.
01:28:31.139,01:28:32.557,Fuck me.
01:28:38.688,01:28:41.274,No noise. You shut up.
01:28:41.357,01:28:43.693,"You make any noise, I'm gonna turn on that tap."
01:29:33.159,01:29:34.410,"Hey, rise and shine."
01:29:40.083,01:29:42.126,"I'm not gonna find two girls here, am I?"
01:29:42.877,01:29:44.170,Fuck you.
01:29:50.802,01:29:51.969,What about Alex Jones?
01:29:53.096,01:29:54.472,What about him?
01:29:55.848,01:29:57.058,I came here to drink.
01:29:57.141,01:29:59.352,I don't want to drink in front of my wife.
01:30:00.394,01:30:03.606,"Look, my father left me this building, all right?"
01:30:07.151,01:30:08.903,You mind giving me a tour?
01:30:20.873,01:30:24.252,-Why didn't you tell me about this place? -I didn't think it mattered.
01:30:25.211,01:30:26.629,Everything matters.
01:30:31.551,01:30:33.719,It's all pretty much like this.
01:30:33.803,01:30:35.721,-I'm gonna renovate soon. -Yeah.
01:30:36.305,01:30:38.641,"Not as organized as your basement, huh?"
01:30:43.104,01:30:45.148,What's up with all the survivor gear in there?
01:30:46.399,01:30:48.609,"Pray for the best, prepare for the worst."
01:30:53.406,01:30:54.949,"Come on, hurry up."
01:31:28.858,01:31:29.984,"Oh, shit."
01:31:34.030,01:31:35.114,Hello?
01:31:38.451,01:31:40.912,The guy that you were looking for was just here.
01:31:40.995,01:31:42.663,He saw me watching him and ran.
01:31:42.747,01:31:44.040,You get a plate?
01:31:49.837,01:31:50.880,Yeah.
01:31:53.591,01:31:54.842,Yeah.
01:31:58.596,01:31:59.680,Yeah.
01:32:01.015,01:32:02.099,"Go home, Mr. Dover."
01:32:31.170,01:32:32.213,Hi.
01:32:33.381,01:32:34.757,Morning.
01:32:44.934,01:32:47.103,"Why'd you run away from me the other night, man?"
01:32:49.146,01:32:51.274,I've never seen you before.
01:32:52.358,01:32:54.235,You sure you have the right house?
01:32:55.528,01:32:58.030,You doin' some shopping at the Value Mall lately?
01:33:01.450,01:33:03.911,"Why, is it a crime to shop there?"
01:33:03.995,01:33:07.123,I can't afford to buy suits from Brooks Brothers.
01:33:12.295,01:33:13.796,"Yeah, I know."
01:33:14.630,01:33:16.173,You bought children's clothes.
01:33:17.925,01:33:19.051,Did I?
01:33:20.094,01:33:21.595,Must've been in a hurry.
01:33:24.765,01:33:25.891,Mm-hmm.
01:33:27.685,01:33:29.228,Do you have children?
01:33:30.313,01:33:31.564,No.
01:33:34.150,01:33:36.152,I don't have...
01:33:37.737,01:33:38.738,Have anything...
01:33:50.458,01:33:51.459,Give me your fucking hand.
01:33:58.549,01:33:59.550,Hey.
01:34:01.177,01:34:03.429,"If you move, I'll put a bullet through your fuckin' head."
01:34:22.656,01:34:26.494,This is 13-40. I need additional unit for search. 437 Carroll Street.
01:34:26.577,01:34:28.412,Possible kidnapping victims on the premises.
01:35:12.081,01:35:13.124,Fuck.
01:35:18.921,01:35:20.506,Anna? Fucking...
01:35:22.049,01:35:23.509,Anna? Joy?
01:35:24.135,01:35:25.344,Fuck.
01:35:36.063,01:35:37.231,Fuck.
01:36:19.023,01:36:20.441,Ah! Fuck.
01:37:02.733,01:37:04.527,Ah. Fuck.
01:37:21.669,01:37:23.128,we found in the suspect's house.
01:38:12.886,01:38:14.346,"Mr. Dover, is your wife here?"
01:38:22.021,01:38:23.314,She's not coming.
01:38:25.482,01:38:30.404,"Yeah, well, if you can't make a positive ID on these photographs, I'm gonna need her to come in and take a look at them."
01:38:37.202,01:38:38.704,Have a seat.
01:38:50.007,01:38:52.384,"So, he confessed? Did he say he killed them?"
01:38:54.094,01:38:55.429,"We were hoping he was lying, but..."
01:38:56.972,01:38:59.475,"We haven't even found any bodies, Mr. Dover, but..."
01:39:04.063,01:39:07.232,...the Birches positively identified two pieces of clothing.
01:39:08.984,01:39:12.946,"So, I'm gonna need you to tell me if you recognize anything."
01:39:35.344,01:39:36.428,No.
01:39:42.518,01:39:43.560,Uh...
01:39:47.064,01:39:48.524,I'm not sure.
01:39:48.982,01:39:51.110,-I don't know. -Okay.
01:39:56.156,01:39:57.199,No.
01:40:25.519,01:40:27.688,That... That's her...
01:40:34.194,01:40:35.571,That's her sock.
01:40:51.295,01:40:52.296,You...
01:40:56.425,01:40:57.968,You wasted time.
01:41:04.308,01:41:06.101,You wasted time following me.
01:41:16.528,01:41:17.946,You let this happen.
01:41:57.611,01:41:58.904,Don't talk to them.
01:42:07.037,01:42:08.539,Eliza told me they're dead.
01:42:11.875,01:42:13.544,-Is it true? -No.
01:42:14.378,01:42:18.590,"No, she said they found their bloody clothes-- Don't you tell your mother that."
01:42:18.674,01:42:20.717,Don't you dare tell your mother that. You understand me?
01:42:21.301,01:42:22.928,"Now, I need you to listen to me."
01:42:23.971,01:42:27.349,"I need you to stay around the house for a couple of days, and you make sure she does not watch the news."
01:42:27.432,01:42:28.976,"And when the paper comes, you just throw it the fuck away."
01:42:29.059,01:42:30.102,Listen to me!
01:42:30.686,01:42:31.979,We do not give up on your sister!
01:42:32.062,01:42:33.105,We do not!
01:42:34.439,01:42:36.567,I'm gonna find her. I'm gonna bring her home.
01:42:36.650,01:42:38.694,-We do not give up. -You're gonna bring her home?
01:42:38.777,01:42:40.863,She's dead. You can't do anything.
01:42:40.946,01:42:42.364,You've been leavin' me and Mom here while you...
01:42:42.447,01:42:43.991,You've been goin' out and getting fuckin' drunk!
01:42:44.074,01:42:45.242,You think I can't smell it on you?
01:42:45.325,01:42:46.952,Shut up!
01:43:16.481,01:43:18.108,And you think this is gonna lead you to the bodies?
01:43:18.191,01:43:19.234,'Cause I sure as shit don't.
01:43:19.318,01:43:22.112,"Do me a favor, Captain. Go fuck yourself."
01:43:22.195,01:43:24.114,We weren't getting anywhere questioning him.
01:43:29.536,01:43:31.121,That looks more like a maze than a map.
01:43:31.204,01:43:32.748,He's got a thing for mazes.
01:43:36.335,01:43:39.379,I'm goin' home. Call me if somethin' happens.
01:44:22.923,01:44:25.676,"Give me that card, Johnny. The key card."
01:44:35.852,01:44:37.229,"All right, it's done now."
01:44:40.107,01:44:41.400,Tell me what you're drawing.
01:44:43.527,01:44:44.945,You said you were drawing a map.
01:44:45.028,01:44:47.656,That looks like a fucking puzzle. You tell me what you're drawing.
01:44:52.953,01:44:54.538,Tell me what you're drawing.
01:44:57.040,01:44:58.333,I can't!
01:44:58.417,01:45:01.294,"-Yes, you can! Yes, you can! -Oh, shit!"
01:45:01.378,01:45:02.421,Shit!
01:45:02.838,01:45:05.090,"Yes, you can! Yes, you can!"
01:45:05.173,01:45:07.467,"-Take him! Come on! -Yes, you can!"
01:45:07.551,01:45:09.094,"Yes, he can!"
01:45:09.970,01:45:11.221,"Oh, shit!"
01:45:11.304,01:45:13.306,Gun! Gun! Gun!
01:45:13.390,01:45:14.558,"Bob, don't! Put the gun down!"
01:45:15.475,01:45:17.227,Bob. Bob. Put the gun down!
01:45:17.310,01:45:19.563,"Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, no! No, no, no!"
01:45:19.646,01:45:20.772,"No, no, no!"
01:45:23.692,01:45:24.860,Fuck.
01:45:27.404,01:45:29.239,Go call a fuckin' R.A.
01:45:34.911,01:45:42.711,"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
01:45:43.128,01:45:51.636,"Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we..."
01:46:00.979,01:46:02.397,As we for...
01:46:23.085,01:46:25.420,He explain this before he ate the bullet?
01:46:31.301,01:46:32.636,I'm sorry.
01:46:33.887,01:46:35.514,Fuck you're sorry.
01:46:35.597,01:46:37.265,Save it for the girls' parents.
01:46:41.645,01:46:43.480,"I don't know what to do, Alex."
01:46:44.815,01:46:47.275,I don't know what to do anymore.
01:46:47.359,01:46:51.154,And what's completely fucked up about all this is I know you know where they are.
01:46:55.158,01:46:56.618,I think we're done.
01:47:07.921,01:47:09.548,That's where you'll find them.
01:47:09.631,01:47:12.551,What? What did you say?
01:47:16.763,01:47:18.098,In the maze.
01:47:19.724,01:47:21.101,What... What maze?
01:47:21.184,01:47:23.687,Where is it? Where is the maze? Where do I find it?
01:47:24.563,01:47:25.689,Alex?
01:47:27.232,01:47:28.650,"Alex, Alex, listen to me."
01:47:28.733,01:47:31.653,"I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? Just tell me where the maze is."
01:47:32.988,01:47:34.614,"That's it. Just tell me, man."
01:47:36.074,01:47:37.742,Where is the maze?
01:47:39.035,01:47:40.495,"Come on, tell me."
01:47:41.288,01:47:43.165,"Just tell me where the maze is, okay?"
01:47:46.209,01:47:49.337,"Come on, don't fuck with me. Don't fuck with me now."
01:47:49.421,01:47:51.756,"Tell me, God damn it! Tell me where they are!"
01:47:52.841,01:47:55.719,Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!
01:47:59.222,01:48:03.143,"Something's gonna get to you, man. Something's gonna get to you!"
01:48:03.226,01:48:05.061,Something's gonna get to you!
01:48:32.464,01:48:34.216,"-Can I help you? -Morning, ma'am."
01:48:34.299,01:48:37.052,"Um, I'm Keller Dover."
01:48:37.135,01:48:41.890,"Uh, my little girl was abducted with a friend."
01:48:44.726,01:48:45.936,What do you want?
01:48:47.479,01:48:48.688,Uh...
01:48:51.858,01:48:53.735,"I guess I haven't thought this through too good, huh?"
01:48:53.818,01:48:55.278,I...
01:48:56.613,01:48:59.199,I've been thinkin' a lot about what happened to your nephew.
01:49:00.992,01:49:04.454,"And I know I scared him the other day at the police station, and..."
01:49:06.122,01:49:09.918,What I'm tryin' to say is I kind of feel responsible for him running away.
01:49:12.712,01:49:14.714,You wanna come on in?
01:49:15.507,01:49:16.549,Yeah.
01:49:26.559,01:49:31.189,My husband and I were very devout at one time.
01:49:33.358,01:49:40.365,"Spent our summers driving around in that camper with our son, handin' out pamphlets."
01:49:42.367,01:49:44.202,Spreadin' the good word.
01:49:47.289,01:49:53.211,"After our son died of cancer, we started seein' things differently."
01:49:55.088,01:49:59.426,"Adopting Alex helped, but we never got over it."
01:50:01.136,01:50:02.262,I'm sorry.
01:50:05.390,01:50:06.975,You look very tired.
01:50:09.060,01:50:11.563,"Yeah, I don't sleep much."
01:50:13.481,01:50:14.733,"I, uh..."
01:50:17.027,01:50:19.612,I keep dreaming about being lost in a maze.
01:50:26.619,01:50:29.956,"Alex never talks very much, so..."
01:50:30.040,01:50:32.417,"When people come over here, I hardly know what to say."
01:50:32.500,01:50:34.002,"-He doesn't talk much? -Well, he talks, you know."
01:50:34.085,01:50:36.463,"Good morning, good night, that sort of thing."
01:50:36.546,01:50:38.840,Hard to get too much more than that out of him.
01:50:41.009,01:50:43.470,He had an accident when he was little.
01:50:43.553,01:50:47.349,"After that, he started choosing his words a little too carefully."
01:50:47.432,01:50:50.894,"What, uh, what kind of accident did he-- Oh."
01:50:51.561,01:50:53.396,My husband kept snakes.
01:50:54.356,01:50:58.026,"It wasn't that bad what happened, but Alex had a fear of them and..."
01:50:59.527,01:51:01.863,That's not my favorite memory.
01:51:02.489,01:51:04.824,I'm sorry. It's none of my business.
01:51:05.992,01:51:07.369,"Oh, it's..."
01:51:10.622,01:51:12.749,"Can I get you a cup of tea, Mr. Dover?"
01:51:18.755,01:51:20.048,Oh.
01:51:20.131,01:51:21.299,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
01:51:21.383,01:51:23.426,I thought you had known about that already.
01:51:24.803,01:51:25.970,I say it's better this way.
01:51:26.054,01:51:31.726,"You know, that awful man, he would have spent years on death row just watchin' TV and gettin' fat."
01:51:36.689,01:51:41.277,"Well, least I don't have to worry about losing you to PSP."
01:51:48.243,01:51:52.831,"When forensics is finished with the guy's place, we're gonna deploy the cadaver dogs."
01:51:53.915,01:51:56.376,"Look, kid, we can't always save the day."
01:51:57.627,01:52:00.839,"All right? We're just cops, janitors."
01:52:02.799,01:52:04.801,"So you lost this one, all right?"
01:52:05.051,01:52:09.889,"Look, you want fulfillment, you need to find a girl, you know, start a family, have some kids."
01:52:10.765,01:52:11.891,Let it go.
01:53:34.390,01:53:35.600,Right.
01:53:42.774,01:53:45.360,"Hey, it's Rich. We found somethin'."
01:53:48.947,01:53:50.281,"Guys, let us have a look."
01:53:55.954,01:53:59.707,"Two kid-sized department store mannequins, with their heads caved in."
01:53:59.791,01:54:04.712,"I just talked to our lab guys, and they told me that all the blood that we sampled from the plastic containers, pig's blood."
01:54:06.548,01:54:08.007,"All right, you guys, let's get this covered up."
01:54:08.091,01:54:09.759,"It's supposed to snow soon. Hurry up, okay?"
01:54:13.388,01:54:15.848,"It's like he's play-acting. I mean, case in point."
01:54:15.932,01:54:21.813,"Except for the few items I.D.'d by the Dovers and the Birches, all the kids' clothes that we found still had the tags on them."
01:54:21.896,01:54:24.440,"And that maze book that we found, he made it."
01:54:24.524,01:54:27.318,"Photocopies, pictures from this book that we found in the attic."
01:54:27.402,01:54:29.153,Ex-F.B.I. Agent wrote that.
01:54:29.237,01:54:30.738,Finding the Invisible Man.
01:54:30.822,01:54:35.368,"Yeah, it's about a theoretical suspect that he believed was responsible for a bunch of child abductions."
01:54:35.451,01:54:38.746,"It's totally discredited, I guess, but I read some of it."
01:54:38.830,01:54:40.748,Taylor... Taylor was abducted when he was a kid.
01:54:40.832,01:54:42.292,He ran away after three weeks.
01:54:42.375,01:54:45.712,And the captor drugged him on some sort of LSD/Ketamine cocktail.
01:54:45.795,01:54:47.881,He never remembered. They never caught the guy.
01:54:48.631,01:54:53.511,"Okay, so, he read the book and decided he was taken by the invisible man."
01:54:53.595,01:54:55.763,"Now he's doing his best imitation, right?"
01:54:58.892,01:55:02.020,"Yeah, he was doing his best imitation. He killed himself last night."
01:55:03.646,01:55:05.899,Fuck me. How did he do that? I thought he was in custody.
01:55:10.695,01:55:11.863,Hey.
01:55:14.198,01:55:16.200,Taylor drew this. It's a map to the bodies.
01:55:16.784,01:55:18.036,It's a map to the bodies.
01:55:18.119,01:55:21.289,And we found the same design on a pendant that we pulled off that corpse the other day.
01:55:21.372,01:55:23.333,There's a connection. Okay?
01:55:23.416,01:55:25.126,The connection is that it's the last maze in the book.
01:55:25.209,01:55:27.295,I did it. It's unsolvable. There's no way out.
01:55:27.378,01:55:30.214,Your corpse is another wannabe who read the book.
01:55:31.591,01:55:32.675,"What are you saying to me, Rich?"
01:55:32.759,01:55:34.135,What are you saying to me? What are you saying?
01:55:34.218,01:55:35.762,That this guy is a fake?
01:55:35.845,01:55:39.015,You're saying that the girls are still out there somewhere?
01:55:39.098,01:55:40.808,How did Bob Taylor get those clothes?
01:55:41.100,01:55:46.606,How did... How did the parents positively I.D. those clothes?
01:55:48.608,01:55:50.276,That I can't reconcile.
01:55:50.818,01:55:52.070,You can't reconcile that?
01:55:52.153,01:55:54.405,"Just keep knockin' on doors, look in the windows."
01:57:27.623,01:57:28.666,Yes?
01:57:31.836,01:57:34.505,"Um, yeah. This is she."
01:57:38.718,01:57:39.802,What?
01:57:42.597,01:57:43.931,"Oh, my God!"
01:57:44.015,01:57:46.726,"Uh, wait. Is she..."
01:57:48.811,01:57:50.438,Ralph! Keller!
01:58:06.162,01:58:08.539,Keller! We need to go to the hospital!
01:58:08.623,01:58:10.124,"-They found Joy, but not Anna! -What?"
01:58:10.208,01:58:11.334,They didn't find Anna!
01:58:11.417,01:58:14.170,"Maybe she'll know where Anna is. Please, we have to go."
01:58:14.921,01:58:16.089,Keller!
01:58:19.008,01:58:20.718,Eliza's not picking up.
01:58:33.106,01:58:34.398,Nobody gets beyond this point.
01:58:34.482,01:58:35.608,Don't touch me.
01:58:35.691,01:58:37.026,-Miss! Wait a minute-- -It's okay.
01:58:40.446,01:58:42.448,They'll find Anna. I know they will.
01:58:45.409,01:58:46.661,How is she?
01:58:49.622,01:58:51.541,"Joy, were you far from our street?"
01:58:51.624,01:58:54.001,"How far from the street were you, Joy?"
01:58:54.085,01:58:55.169,Joy?
01:58:55.253,01:58:56.379,You can't be doing this now.
01:58:56.462,01:58:57.672,How long did it take you to get there?
01:58:57.755,01:58:59.465,-Just let me ask a question. Please. -Keller!
01:58:59.549,01:59:02.552,The detective will be back in just a minute. You need to wait.
01:59:02.635,01:59:03.928,She's been drugged.
01:59:05.596,01:59:06.764,Sweetheart...
01:59:07.682,01:59:10.226,"Just let us know she's alive, okay?"
01:59:11.269,01:59:12.395,"Can you just nod your head, baby?"
01:59:12.478,01:59:14.981,Just nod your head? Baby?
01:59:16.023,01:59:19.527,"Can you give us a nod? Can you nod your head for us, please? Joy?"
02:00:04.280,02:00:05.323,You were there.
02:00:07.783,02:00:09.827,What? I was... I was where?
02:00:17.084,02:00:19.086,"It's okay. It's okay, baby."
02:00:20.171,02:00:21.881,It's okay. It's okay.
02:00:22.924,02:00:25.718,"Mommy and Daddy are here now, okay?"
02:00:25.801,02:00:27.386,You're all right.
02:00:29.972,02:00:32.266,I said nobody's allowed in that room but her family.
02:00:32.350,02:00:34.101,Hey! Where you goin'?
02:00:34.185,02:00:35.561,-Keller? -Hey!
02:00:35.645,02:00:36.771,-Where's he goin'? -I don't know.
02:00:38.022,02:00:39.273,Hey!
02:00:39.357,02:00:40.733,Call downstairs. Don't let him go.
02:00:40.816,02:00:42.443,-Hey! Hey! -Block off the exits.
02:00:43.319,02:00:44.695,Hey!
02:00:47.240,02:00:48.616,Stop that car! Get his truck!
02:00:48.699,02:00:51.619,Stop it! Hey! Hey!
02:01:13.724,02:01:15.351,"I've got you, you fucker."
02:01:16.394,02:01:17.937,I know where you're goin'.
02:01:19.063,02:01:20.439,I know where you're goin'.
02:02:39.268,02:02:40.311,Hello again.
02:02:40.895,02:02:45.107,"Hey. I was hoping you'd, uh, you'd let me do some penance."
02:02:46.859,02:02:48.110,For what?
02:02:48.194,02:02:52.365,"For scaring you the other day at the, uh, the police station."
02:02:52.448,02:02:54.533,You already apologized for that.
02:02:54.617,02:02:57.244,"I know. I was, you know, I thought maybe you, uh..."
02:02:58.454,02:03:00.831,"You could use some, uh, help around the..."
02:03:00.915,02:03:04.418,"You know, I noticed your door here needs fixing, so I brought my tools and, uh..."
02:03:04.835,02:03:06.045,Oh.
02:03:06.921,02:03:07.963,I see.
02:03:10.674,02:03:13.594,I burned myself. Feel a little icky today.
02:03:15.930,02:03:18.849,But I'm glad you want to talk some more.
02:03:19.433,02:03:21.102,No need to make excuses.
02:03:21.685,02:03:24.146,You come on in and make me a cup of tea.
02:03:33.781,02:03:35.032,Come on in.
02:03:54.885,02:03:56.762,I don't want to have to hurt you.
02:03:59.557,02:04:01.308,I know they were here.
02:04:03.561,02:04:05.396,Put your hands on your head and turn around.
02:04:08.232,02:04:09.233,Do it.
02:04:13.028,02:04:14.822,I'm just gonna go.
02:04:14.905,02:04:16.490,Don't touch that bag.
02:04:17.575,02:04:19.368,Put your hands on your head.
02:04:24.331,02:04:27.460,Come over here to this counter. Come on.
02:04:37.052,02:04:38.220,Top drawer.
02:04:39.847,02:04:40.931,Open it.
02:04:47.396,02:04:48.856,Mm-hmm.
02:04:50.483,02:04:52.067,Put them on.
02:05:02.328,02:05:04.246,"You don't know me, Mr. Dover."
02:05:05.372,02:05:08.626,"But believe me when I tell you, I won't let you go."
02:05:17.635,02:05:19.386,You don't have to drink all of it.
02:05:20.721,02:05:23.349,About a third should do for a man your size.
02:05:25.643,02:05:27.520,Something to make you more manageable.
02:05:27.603,02:05:28.687,Forget it.
02:05:28.771,02:05:35.569,"Drink it, Mr. Dover, or I'll kill you right here in my kitchen and bring your daughter in here and have her scrub your brains off the floor."
02:05:39.740,02:05:40.866,Drink.
02:05:41.492,02:05:43.118,Just let me see her.
02:05:43.577,02:05:45.329,-You want to see her? -Yes!
02:05:46.080,02:05:48.832,That's your ticket to your daughter right there.
02:06:01.512,02:06:02.930,Little more.
02:06:09.061,02:06:10.521,"Good, isn't it?"
02:06:11.730,02:06:13.732,That's my darlin' husband's recipe.
02:06:22.074,02:06:23.117,Now go on out back.
02:06:23.701,02:06:25.244,Let me see her.
02:06:31.375,02:06:33.252,Take it out of your pocket.
02:06:35.671,02:06:37.298,Put it in the sink.
02:06:50.603,02:06:52.646,Put your car keys on the table.
02:06:55.482,02:06:57.943,Put your car keys on the table.
02:07:00.654,02:07:02.072,That's right.
02:07:03.073,02:07:04.825,Over to the Trans-Am over there.
02:07:04.908,02:07:06.827,"The car over there. Come on, move it."
02:07:07.494,02:07:08.621,Get over there.
02:07:16.462,02:07:18.213,The look on your face.
02:07:19.214,02:07:23.260,My husband used to have the very same look till we took Alex.
02:07:23.886,02:07:26.013,He was the first kid we ever took.
02:07:26.096,02:07:27.389,His name was Jimmy.
02:07:27.473,02:07:29.266,Or Barry.
02:07:30.059,02:07:31.810,"Can't remember. Doubt he can, either."
02:07:32.645,02:07:34.313,So many names.
02:07:34.855,02:07:38.525,Forgot all about Bobby Taylor till I read about him in the paper.
02:07:41.195,02:07:43.030,Get in the driver's seat.
02:07:52.998,02:07:54.792,Open the door and get in the car.
02:08:10.391,02:08:14.311,Making children disappear is the war we wage with God.
02:08:16.563,02:08:18.440,Makes people lose their faith.
02:08:19.149,02:08:21.193,Turns them into demons like you.
02:08:23.112,02:08:25.906,Had to slow down since my husband disappeared.
02:08:27.199,02:08:28.575,But I do what I can.
02:08:30.619,02:08:32.037,Start the car.
02:08:33.288,02:08:34.707,Start the car.
02:08:40.754,02:08:41.797,Keep tryin'.
02:08:48.429,02:08:50.431,Back up. Slowly.
02:08:55.227,02:08:57.896,Come on. Back up.
02:09:00.399,02:09:01.900,Come on.
02:09:05.654,02:09:07.114,Stop.
02:09:07.197,02:09:08.699,Turn it off.
02:09:09.366,02:09:10.784,Turn it off!
02:09:12.578,02:09:13.746,Get out.
02:09:23.255,02:09:24.715,Think you should know.
02:09:25.257,02:09:27.718,Alex never laid a hand on those girls.
02:09:28.093,02:09:30.220,Just wanted to take 'em for a ride in the camper.
02:09:31.263,02:09:33.557,I was the one who decided they should stay.
02:09:37.269,02:09:38.771,Take a look.
02:09:40.522,02:09:41.815,Maybe your daughter's under there.
02:09:42.941,02:09:44.151,You never know.
02:09:46.445,02:09:47.446,Anna.
02:09:48.739,02:09:49.782,Anna.
02:09:55.704,02:09:56.914,Anna?
02:09:56.997,02:10:00.375,Anna. Anna! Anna!
02:10:01.293,02:10:05.297,I had the girls down there when the police came pokin' around.
02:10:06.173,02:10:08.050,Should have left 'em down there.
02:10:09.218,02:10:10.844,I was so lonely without Alex.
02:10:13.388,02:10:15.974,-Now get in there. -What?
02:10:16.934,02:10:18.018,Get in.
02:10:22.064,02:10:24.608,"You want me to get in there, you're gonna have to shoot me."
02:10:25.526,02:10:28.195,I'm not gonna get in there just 'cause you asked.
02:10:30.113,02:10:33.075,God! Oh! God!
02:10:39.373,02:10:42.000,Go on. Get in there.
02:10:49.383,02:10:50.551,That's right.
02:11:08.652,02:11:09.695,Ah!
02:11:10.863,02:11:12.573,Make yourself a tourniquet.
02:11:13.991,02:11:16.034,Just might last 24 hours.
02:11:21.540,02:11:25.627,I'd love for you to still be alive when I dump your daughter's body down there.
02:11:31.758,02:11:33.302,"Wait! No, wait, wait, wait!"
02:11:33.385,02:11:34.636,Wait!
02:11:38.015,02:11:39.892,No. No.
02:12:03.874,02:12:05.584,Hey.
02:12:05.667,02:12:07.252,I need you to go over to Holly Jones'.
02:12:07.336,02:12:09.504,-She needs to be notified. -No. I need to find Dover.
02:12:09.588,02:12:11.715,"Come on. You're done with Dover, okay? Please?"
02:12:11.798,02:12:12.799,You want me to go to Holly Jones'?
02:12:12.883,02:12:15.427,"I want you to go to Holly Jones' and notify her, please."
02:12:30.359,02:12:32.277,"Oh, God."
02:13:45.100,02:13:46.476,Almighty God...
02:13:47.644,02:13:49.104,Protect my girl.
02:15:03.053,02:15:04.137,Mrs. Jones?
02:15:16.650,02:15:17.943,Mrs. Jones?
02:16:49.659,02:16:50.952,Show me your hands right now.
02:16:52.120,02:16:54.623,Don't move and show me your fuckin' hands right now.
02:16:55.332,02:16:56.791,Stop! Right now!
02:16:57.167,02:16:59.920,Show me your fuckin' hands. Do not move and show me your hands.
02:17:00.670,02:17:02.088,Make sure they cremate me.
02:17:02.172,02:17:05.008,I sure as hell don't want to be buried in some box.
02:17:05.091,02:17:06.635,Both hands! Right now!
02:17:06.718,02:17:07.802,Right now!
02:17:09.679,02:17:10.722,Fuck!
02:17:22.776,02:17:23.902,Anna.
02:17:25.111,02:17:26.446,"Oh, my God."
02:17:42.921,02:17:44.422,"Oh, God."
02:17:47.008,02:17:48.093,Anna.
02:18:04.359,02:18:05.902,"Oh, shit."
02:18:22.961,02:18:26.256,Come on. Come on. Anna. Anna. Come on.
02:18:30.343,02:18:32.804,"Stay with me, Anna. Anna, stay with me, huh?"
02:18:34.055,02:18:35.307,"Stay with me, Anna."
02:18:44.190,02:18:45.692,"Stay with me, Anna! It's all right!"
02:18:45.775,02:18:47.485,It's all right! Come on!
02:18:47.569,02:18:49.112,"Go, move, move, move, move!"
02:18:58.496,02:18:59.998,"Don't die, don't die."
02:19:27.692,02:19:28.943,"It's okay, it's okay."
02:19:30.779,02:19:32.697,Honey. You're okay.
02:19:33.406,02:19:35.075,Hey. Hey.
02:19:36.076,02:19:37.786,Hey! Help!
02:19:39.120,02:19:41.206,Help! Help!
02:19:41.289,02:19:44.084,Help! Help!
02:20:05.939,02:20:07.607,"Uh, Detective Loki?"
02:20:10.944,02:20:12.570,I hope we're not intruding.
02:20:13.488,02:20:14.697,No.
02:20:19.244,02:20:20.412,She's doing real good.
02:20:22.288,02:20:25.875,"She's gonna be up and around in a few days, aren't you, buddy?"
02:20:26.251,02:20:29.629,She just wanted to come and say thank you and hi to her hero.
02:20:35.301,02:20:36.344,Hello.
02:20:45.270,02:20:47.564,"Uh, would you mind giving me a minute?"
02:20:49.065,02:20:50.233,-Yeah. -Thank you.
02:20:50.316,02:20:51.609,"-Say goodbye, Joy. -Bye."
02:20:51.693,02:20:52.777,I'll be out in a minute. All right?
02:20:52.861,02:20:54.112,"Say goodbye, Anna."
02:21:20.972,02:21:22.307,She found her whistle?
02:21:24.100,02:21:25.268,"Uh, no."
02:21:25.977,02:21:30.773,She keeps insisting that Joy helped her find it on Thanksgiving before they were taken.
02:21:31.566,02:21:33.693,But I think she's just confused.
02:21:35.320,02:21:36.696,I got her a new one.
02:21:54.130,02:21:56.007,He hasn't contacted me.
02:21:59.802,02:22:01.387,I know you don't...
02:22:01.471,02:22:03.848,"I know you probably don't believe that, but he hasn't."
02:22:11.606,02:22:12.982,I believe you.
02:22:21.533,02:22:23.159,Do you think you're gonna find him?
02:22:27.956,02:22:29.082,Yeah.
02:22:30.625,02:22:32.168,And he'll go to jail.
02:22:34.879,02:22:36.297,Probably.
02:22:40.260,02:22:41.844,Anyway...
02:22:43.179,02:22:44.889,Thank you for everything.
02:23:01.447,02:23:03.074,I miss him.
02:23:07.078,02:23:13.209,He... He did what he had to do to find Anna and I thank God for that.
02:23:23.386,02:23:25.096,He's a good man.
02:23:34.564,02:23:35.648,Bye.
02:24:00.923,02:24:02.342,That's it. Let's pack it up.
02:24:10.183,02:24:11.809,You all done for the night?
02:24:12.310,02:24:14.562,"Yeah, the ground's frozen solid."
02:24:14.646,02:24:17.065,It's gonna take weeks to excavate the entire property.
02:24:17.148,02:24:19.359,Just found some dead snakes and shit.
02:24:22.028,02:24:24.530,"Pray for the best, prepare for the worst, yeah?"
02:24:26.949,02:24:28.034,Night.
02:24:31.245,02:24:32.538,Night.
02:24:33.748,02:24:35.166,Shut her down.
