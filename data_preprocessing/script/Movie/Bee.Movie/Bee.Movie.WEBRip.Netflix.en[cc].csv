00:00:10.177,00:00:11.553,Hey!
00:00:57.140,00:00:59.059,"Yellow, black. Yellow, black."
00:00:59.059,00:01:00.936,"Yellow, black."
00:01:00.936,00:01:04.231,"Ooh, black and yellow! Yeah, let's shake it up a little."
00:01:14.825,00:01:17.870,Barry!
00:01:17.870,00:01:19.747,Coming!
00:01:19.747,00:01:22.457,"Oh, hang on a second."
00:01:22.457,00:01:23.667,Hello?
00:01:23.667,00:01:25.044,Adam?
00:01:25.044,00:01:26.628,Can you believe this is happening?
00:01:26.628,00:01:29.381,Can't believe it.
00:01:31.174,00:01:33.260,Looking sharp.
00:01:36.638,00:01:38.223,"Barry, why don't you use the stairs?"
00:01:38.223,00:01:39.934,Your father paid good money for those.
00:01:39.934,00:01:41.643,Sorry. I'm excited.
00:01:41.643,00:01:44.187,Here's the graduate.
00:01:44.187,00:01:46.941,"And a perfect report card, all B's."
00:01:46.941,00:01:48.358,Very proud.
00:01:48.358,00:01:50.151,Ma! I got a thing going here.
00:01:50.151,00:01:51.528,You got some lint on your fuzz.
00:01:51.528,00:01:52.863,Ow! That's me!
00:01:52.863,00:01:55.824,Wave to us!
00:01:55.824,00:01:57.242,Bye!
00:01:57.242,00:01:59.286,"Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!"
00:02:21.100,00:02:22.851,"Hey, Adam."
00:02:22.851,00:02:24.394,Is that fuzz gel?
00:02:24.394,00:02:26.480,"A little. It's a special day, finally graduating."
00:02:26.480,00:02:28.065,Never thought I'd make it.
00:02:28.065,00:02:30.275,"Three days of grade school, three days of high school."
00:02:30.275,00:02:32.778,Those were so awkward.
00:02:32.778,00:02:35.864,I'm glad I took off one day in the middle and hitchhiked around the hive.
00:02:35.864,00:02:37.532,You did come back different.
00:02:37.532,00:02:39.242,"ARTIE: Hi, Barry!"
00:02:39.242,00:02:41.578,"BARRY: Hey, Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good."
00:02:41.578,00:02:44.123,"Hey, did you hear about Frankie?"
00:02:44.123,00:02:45.373,You going to his funeral?
00:02:45.373,00:02:46.959,"No, I'm not going to his funeral."
00:02:46.959,00:02:48.961,"Everybody knows you sting someone, you die."
00:02:48.961,00:02:51.463,You don't waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hothead.
00:02:51.463,00:02:54.967,"Yeah, I guess he could have just gotten out of the way."
00:02:54.967,00:02:57.136,BOTH: Whoa!
00:03:01.640,00:03:05.644,ADAM: I love this incorporating an amusement park right into our regular day.
00:03:05.644,00:03:08.022,I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
00:03:13.861,00:03:17.948,"Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances."
00:03:21.702,00:03:23.954,"Well, Adam, today we are men."
00:03:23.954,00:03:25.288,Bee-men.
00:03:25.288,00:03:26.623,BOTH: Hallelujah!
00:03:27.875,00:03:33.212,"Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell."
00:03:34.548,00:03:41.013,"Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15."
00:03:42.597,00:03:44.474,That concludes our graduation ceremonies.
00:03:46.185,00:03:50.397,And begins your career at Honex Industries!
00:03:50.397,00:03:52.024,Are we gonna pick our job today?
00:03:52.024,00:03:53.775,I heard it's just orientation.
00:03:53.775,00:03:56.486,Whoa! Heads up!
00:03:56.486,00:04:01.116,Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
00:04:08.707,00:04:10.876,BARRY: I wonder what it's gonna be like.
00:04:10.876,00:04:12.502,ADAM: A little scary.
00:04:14.171,00:04:20.301,"Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group."
00:04:20.301,00:04:21.636,This is it!
00:04:24.056,00:04:25.224,Wow.
00:04:30.187,00:04:31.897,Wow.
00:04:31.897,00:04:37.485,We know that you as a bee have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
00:04:38.820,00:04:43.617,Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
00:04:43.617,00:04:56.296,"Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you all know as..."
00:04:56.296,00:04:57.839,ALL: Honey!
00:05:00.968,00:05:02.261,That girl was hot.
00:05:02.261,00:05:03.470,She's my cousin!
00:05:03.470,00:05:05.430,She is?
00:05:05.430,00:05:06.765,Right. You're right.
00:05:06.765,00:05:12.646,"At Honex, we also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence."
00:05:12.646,00:05:15.149,These bees are stress testing a new helmet technology.
00:05:17.276,00:05:18.819,Ow!
00:05:29.288,00:05:30.580,Ha!
00:05:30.580,00:05:32.373,Ooh.
00:05:32.373,00:05:34.751,What do you think he makes?
00:05:34.751,00:05:38.337,"TRUDY: And here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman."
00:05:38.337,00:05:39.798,"Wow, what does that do?"
00:05:39.798,00:05:45.262,TRUDY: Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
00:05:47.139,00:05:49.516,"Uh, can anyone work on the Krelman?"
00:05:49.516,00:05:52.602,TRUDY: Of course.
00:05:49.516,00:05:57.649,"Most bee jobs are small ones, but bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot."
00:05:57.649,00:06:05.199,But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life.
00:06:05.199,00:06:08.743,The same job for the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
00:06:08.743,00:06:11.079,What's the difference?
00:06:11.079,00:06:16.960,TRUDY: And you'll be happy to know that bees as a species haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
00:06:16.960,00:06:18.337,Whoo!
00:06:18.337,00:06:21.089,So you'll just work us to death?
00:06:21.089,00:06:22.465,We'll sure try.
00:06:40.234,00:06:44.487,ADAM: Wow! That blew my mind!
00:06:44.487,00:06:47.199,What's the difference?
00:06:47.199,00:06:48.700,One job forever?
00:06:48.700,00:06:50.660,That's an insane choice to have to make.
00:06:50.660,00:06:52.037,"Well, I'm relieved."
00:06:52.037,00:06:53.872,Now we only have to make one decision in life.
00:06:53.872,00:06:56.791,"But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?"
00:06:56.791,00:06:59.669,"Barry, why would you question anything? We're bees."
00:06:59.669,00:07:01.922,We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
00:07:01.922,00:07:04.423,Hey!
00:07:04.423,00:07:08.469,"Yeah, but, Adam, did you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here?"
00:07:08.469,00:07:10.597,Like what?
00:07:13.516,00:07:17.354,I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
00:07:19.480,00:07:21.524,Please clear the gate.
00:07:21.524,00:07:23.026,Royal Nectar Force on approach.
00:07:23.026,00:07:24.403,Wait a second.
00:07:24.403,00:07:26.280,"Hey, hey, those are Pollen Jocks!"
00:07:26.280,00:07:27.488,Wow.
00:07:39.167,00:07:41.169,I've never seen them this close.
00:07:41.169,00:07:43.130,They know what it's like to go outside the hive.
00:07:43.130,00:07:45.424,"Yeah, but some of them don't come back."
00:07:45.424,00:07:47.175,"Hey, Jocks!"
00:08:10.073,00:08:12.075,LOU LO DUCA: You guys did great!
00:08:12.075,00:08:14.828,You're monsters!
00:08:14.828,00:08:16.621,I love it! I love it!
00:08:16.621,00:08:18.706,I wonder where those guys have just been.
00:08:18.706,00:08:20.625,I don't know.
00:08:20.625,00:08:24.212,"Outside the hive flying who knows where, doing who knows what."
00:08:24.212,00:08:26.881,You can't just decide one day to be a Pollen Jock.
00:08:26.881,00:08:28.467,You have to be bred for that.
00:08:28.467,00:08:30.593,Right.
00:08:30.593,00:08:32.553,Look at that.
00:08:32.553,00:08:34.973,That's more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime.
00:08:34.973,00:08:36.308,It's just a status symbol.
00:08:36.308,00:08:38.143,I think bees make too big a deal out of it.
00:08:38.143,00:08:43.231,"Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it, and the ladies see you wearing it."
00:08:44.816,00:08:47.068,Those ladies? Ooh...
00:08:47.068,00:08:49.363,Distant. Distant.
00:08:49.363,00:08:51.198,Look at these two.
00:08:51.198,00:08:52.407,Couple of Hive Harrys.
00:08:52.407,00:08:54.159,Let's have some fun with them.
00:08:54.159,00:08:56.577,It must be so dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
00:08:56.577,00:08:59.331,"Oh, yeah. One time a bear had me pinned up against a mushroom!"
00:08:59.331,00:09:03.502,"He had one paw on my throat and with the other, he was slapping me back and forth across the face."
00:09:03.502,00:09:04.752,"Oh, my!"
00:09:04.752,00:09:06.254,I never thought I'd knock him out.
00:09:06.254,00:09:07.922,And what were you doing during all of this?
00:09:07.922,00:09:09.883,"Obviously, I was trying to alert the authorities."
00:09:09.883,00:09:11.759,I can autograph that if you want.
00:09:11.759,00:09:14.221,"A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?"
00:09:14.221,00:09:15.889,Yeah. Gusty.
00:09:15.889,00:09:19.351,We're gonna hit a sunflower patch about six miles from here tomorrow.
00:09:19.351,00:09:21.019,"Six miles, huh?"
00:09:21.019,00:09:24.481,"It's a puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it."
00:09:24.481,00:09:26.525,Maybe I am.
00:09:26.525,00:09:28.568,We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
00:09:28.568,00:09:30.611,ADAM: Whoa.
00:09:30.611,00:09:34.032,"What do you think, buzzy-boy?"
00:09:34.032,00:09:38.745,I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
00:09:47.045,00:09:48.838,"Hey, Honex!"
00:09:48.838,00:09:51.674,"Dad, you surprised me."
00:09:51.674,00:09:53.801,"Have you decided what you're interested in, son?"
00:09:53.801,00:09:55.136,"Well, there's a lot of choices."
00:09:55.136,00:09:57.638,But you only get one.
00:09:57.638,00:10:00.392,"Dad, do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?"
00:10:00.392,00:10:02.519,"Son, let me tell you something about stirring."
00:10:02.519,00:10:06.689,You grab that stick and you just move it around and you stir it around.
00:10:06.689,00:10:09.859,You get yourself into a rhythm.
00:10:09.859,00:10:15.698,"You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me."
00:10:15.698,00:10:18.326,"And you were thinking of what, making balloon animals?"
00:10:18.326,00:10:20.161,That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
00:10:20.161,00:10:24.249,"Well, no-- Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!"
00:10:24.249,00:10:26.960,"Oh, Barry, you are so funny sometimes."
00:10:26.960,00:10:28.462,I'm not trying to be funny.
00:10:28.462,00:10:30.505,You're not funny.
00:10:30.505,00:10:31.923,"Our son, the stirrer!"
00:10:31.923,00:10:33.674,You're going to be a stirrer?
00:10:33.674,00:10:35.051,No one's listening to me!
00:10:35.051,00:10:36.719,Wait till you see the sticks I have for you.
00:10:36.719,00:10:38.388,I can say anything I want right now.
00:10:38.388,00:10:39.889,I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
00:10:39.889,00:10:42.016,Let's open some fresh honey and celebrate!
00:10:42.016,00:10:44.185,Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
00:10:44.185,00:10:46.813,Shave my antennae.
00:10:46.813,00:10:49.649,Get a gold tooth and start calling everybody dawg!
00:10:49.649,00:10:51.067,I'm so proud.
00:10:57.824,00:10:59.867,I can't believe we're starting work today!
00:10:59.867,00:11:01.453,Today's the day.
00:11:01.453,00:11:02.954,All the good jobs will be gone.
00:11:02.954,00:11:05.332,"Yeah, right."
00:11:05.332,00:11:09.503,"BUZZWELL: Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal..."
00:11:09.503,00:11:11.546,Is it still available?
00:11:11.546,00:11:13.465,Two left!
00:11:13.465,00:11:15.467,"Congratulations, son!"
00:11:15.467,00:11:16.717,Yeah!
00:11:16.717,00:11:18.094,Picking the crud out.
00:11:18.094,00:11:20.013,That is stellar!
00:11:20.013,00:11:21.889,Couple of newbies?
00:11:21.889,00:11:23.433,Our first day!
00:11:23.433,00:11:25.268,"Well, step up and make your choice."
00:11:27.187,00:11:29.397,You want to go first?
00:11:29.397,00:11:31.399,"Oh, my."
00:11:31.399,00:11:34.402,Restroom attendant's always open and not for the reason you think.
00:11:34.402,00:11:36.904,"Any chance of getting onto the Krelman, sir?"
00:11:36.904,00:11:38.490,"Sure, you're on."
00:11:40.450,00:11:42.369,"Oh, I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out."
00:11:42.369,00:11:43.786,Oh!
00:11:43.786,00:11:46.747,And the Krelman just opened up again.
00:11:46.747,00:11:48.166,What happened?
00:11:48.166,00:11:49.750,"Whenever a bee dies, that's an opening."
00:11:49.750,00:11:51.670,See that? He's dead. Dead.
00:11:51.670,00:11:54.255,Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
00:11:54.255,00:11:56.799,Dead from the neck down.
00:11:56.799,00:11:59.802,"Oh, this is so hard!"
00:11:59.802,00:12:07.310,"Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, antenna block polisher, mite wrangler."
00:12:07.310,00:12:10.438,"Barry, Barry, what do you think I should-- Barry?"
00:12:10.438,00:12:12.357,Barry!
00:12:12.357,00:12:15.276,LOU LO DUCA: We've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
00:12:16.819,00:12:18.737,ADAM: What happened to you?
00:12:18.737,00:12:20.699,I'm going out.
00:12:20.699,00:12:22.659,Out there.
00:12:22.659,00:12:24.911,"I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life."
00:12:24.911,00:12:27.706,You're gonna die!
00:12:27.706,00:12:30.333,"Oh, another call coming in."
00:12:27.706,00:12:36.964,"You're-- LOU LO DUCA: If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today."
00:12:36.964,00:12:39.259,"Hey, guys."
00:12:39.259,00:12:41.344,Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
00:12:41.344,00:12:43.555,"Hold it, son."
00:12:43.555,00:12:45.098,"It's okay, Lou."
00:12:45.098,00:12:46.516,Yeah.
00:12:46.516,00:12:47.934,"Feeling lucky, are you?"
00:12:47.934,00:12:51.979,"Sign here, here."
00:12:51.979,00:12:58.986,"Okay, you got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain."
00:12:58.986,00:13:05.368,"So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats."
00:13:05.368,00:13:09.372,"Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us."
00:13:09.372,00:13:14.252,"Murphy's in a home because of it, just babbling like a cicada!"
00:13:14.252,00:13:15.462,That's awful.
00:13:15.462,00:13:21.050,"And a reminder for all you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!"
00:13:21.050,00:13:23.637,"All right, launch positions!"
00:13:23.637,00:13:28.516,"ALL: Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!"
00:13:30.477,00:13:32.186,Black and yellow!
00:13:32.186,00:13:34.188,ALL: Hello!
00:13:34.188,00:13:36.857,"You ready for this, hot shot?"
00:13:36.857,00:13:38.859,"Yeah. Yeah, bring it on."
00:13:38.859,00:13:41.154,"Wind, check."
00:13:41.154,00:13:43.490,"Nectar pack, check."
00:13:43.490,00:13:44.865,"Stinger, check."
00:13:44.865,00:13:46.909,"Scared out of my shorts, check."
00:13:46.909,00:13:49.996,"Okay, ladies, let's move it out!"
00:13:59.880,00:14:04.469,"Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!"
00:14:04.469,00:14:08.847,"All of you, drain those flowers!"
00:14:24.989,00:14:28.284,Wow! I'm out!
00:14:28.284,00:14:30.370,I can't believe I'm out!
00:14:32.163,00:14:33.914,So blue.
00:14:40.839,00:14:42.716,I feel so fast and free!
00:14:44.300,00:14:45.635,Box kite!
00:14:47.136,00:14:48.513,Wow!
00:15:03.862,00:15:06.364,Flowers!
00:15:10.660,00:15:13.454,This is Blue Leader.
00:15:13.454,00:15:15.749,Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
00:15:15.749,00:15:17.417,Roses!
00:15:17.417,00:15:19.586,"POLLEN JOCK: 30 degrees, roger."
00:15:30.764,00:15:33.433,"Stand to the side, kid."
00:15:41.065,00:15:42.817,"Oh, that is one nectar collector."
00:15:43.943,00:15:45.528,You ever see pollination up close?
00:15:45.528,00:15:47.238,"No, sir."
00:15:47.238,00:15:49.449,"I pick up some pollen over here, sprinkle it over here."
00:15:49.449,00:15:52.034,"Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one."
00:15:52.034,00:15:54.454,"See that? It's a little bit of magic, ain't it?"
00:15:54.454,00:15:57.164,Wow. That's amazing.
00:15:57.164,00:15:58.917,"That's pollen power, kid."
00:15:58.917,00:16:01.961,"More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us."
00:16:01.961,00:16:03.170,Cool.
00:16:24.442,00:16:26.110,I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
00:16:26.110,00:16:29.530,Could be daisies.
00:16:29.530,00:16:31.365,Copy that visual.
00:16:31.365,00:16:33.785,Hold on. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
00:16:33.785,00:16:36.454,Say again? Are you reporting a moving flower?
00:16:36.454,00:16:38.164,Affirmative.
00:16:48.132,00:16:49.843,MAN: That was on the line!
00:16:49.843,00:16:52.595,This is the coolest.
00:16:52.595,00:16:54.430,"I don't know, but I'm loving this color."
00:16:56.223,00:16:59.393,"It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it."
00:16:59.393,00:17:01.061,"Yeah, fuzzy."
00:17:01.061,00:17:02.939,Chemically.
00:17:02.939,00:17:05.191,"Careful, guys."
00:17:06.526,00:17:08.402,Sweet lord of bees!
00:17:08.402,00:17:10.780,"Hey, candy-brain, get off there!"
00:17:10.780,00:17:12.281,Problem!
00:17:14.951,00:17:17.328,Guys!
00:17:17.328,00:17:18.997,Affirmative.
00:17:18.997,00:17:20.373,Very close.
00:17:20.373,00:17:22.124,Gonna hurt.
00:17:23.376,00:17:24.836,Mama's little boy.
00:17:24.836,00:17:26.921,"You are way out of position, rookie!"
00:17:29.507,00:17:32.426,POLLEN JOCK: It's coming in at you like a missile!
00:17:35.471,00:17:39.350,Help me!
00:17:39.350,00:17:41.268,"You know, I don't think these are flowers."
00:17:41.268,00:17:43.563,Should we tell him?
00:17:43.563,00:17:45.231,BARRY: What is this?
00:17:46.983,00:17:49.819,Whoa!
00:17:49.819,00:17:51.153,Match point!
00:17:51.153,00:17:56.450,"You can just start packing up, honey, because I believe you're about to eat it!"
00:17:57.577,00:17:59.620,Huh?
00:18:04.709,00:18:06.836,Yowser!
00:18:34.739,00:18:36.074,Ew! Gross.
00:18:41.829,00:18:43.957,There's a bee in the car! Ah!
00:18:45.583,00:18:47.293,Do something!
00:18:47.293,00:18:49.211,"Hi, bee."
00:18:49.211,00:18:51.130,He's back here!
00:18:51.130,00:18:53.507,"Oh, my God!"
00:18:53.507,00:18:55.802,Aah! Ow!
00:18:58.930,00:19:02.767,"Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!"
00:19:04.644,00:19:06.020,He blinked!
00:19:06.020,00:19:08.856,"GIRL: Spray him, Granny!"
00:19:16.697,00:19:21.243,"Wow, the tension level out here is unbelievable."
00:19:21.243,00:19:22.829,I gotta get home.
00:19:22.829,00:19:24.622,Whoa!
00:19:32.672,00:19:36.216,Can't fly in rain.
00:19:36.216,00:19:38.344,Can't fly in rain.
00:19:46.352,00:19:48.980,Mayday! Mayday!
00:19:52.399,00:19:54.443,"Ken, could you close the window, please?"
00:19:54.443,00:19:56.779,"Eh? Oh. Hey, check out my new resume."
00:19:56.779,00:19:58.572,I made it into a foldout brochure.
00:19:58.572,00:20:00.491,You see? Folds out.
00:20:00.491,00:20:03.243,"Oh, no. More humans."
00:20:04.745,00:20:06.080,Ow!
00:20:06.080,00:20:07.623,What was that?
00:20:07.623,00:20:10.877,Maybe this time. This time.
00:20:10.877,00:20:12.586,Oh! Drapes!
00:20:13.546,00:20:15.297,That is diabolical.
00:20:15.297,00:20:16.716,KEN: It's fantastic.
00:20:16.716,00:20:20.427,"It's got all my special skills, even my top ten favorite movies."
00:20:20.427,00:20:22.304,What's your number one?
00:20:22.304,00:20:23.597,"No, I don't go for that..."
00:20:25.432,00:20:27.185,...kind of stuff.
00:20:27.185,00:20:28.853,No wonder we're not supposed to talk to them.
00:20:28.853,00:20:30.521,They're out of their minds.
00:20:30.521,00:20:32.732,"When I walk out of an interview, they're flabbergasted."
00:20:32.732,00:20:34.483,They can't believe the things I say.
00:20:34.483,00:20:37.945,"Oh, there's the sun."
00:20:37.945,00:20:41.407,I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
00:20:47.287,00:20:50.166,I gotta tell you.
00:20:50.166,00:20:51.918,I could feel it getting hotter.
00:20:51.918,00:20:53.586,At first I thought it was just me.
00:20:54.587,00:20:56.839,Wait! Stop! Bee!
00:20:56.839,00:20:59.133,Kill it! Kill it!
00:20:59.133,00:21:01.928,Stand back.
00:21:03.804,00:21:05.472,Wait!
00:21:05.472,00:21:07.183,Don't kill him!
00:21:07.183,00:21:10.352,You know I'm allergic to them!
00:21:10.352,00:21:13.272,"Well, why does his life have any less value than yours?"
00:21:13.272,00:21:17.777,Why does his life have any less value than mine?
00:21:17.777,00:21:19.070,Is that your statement?
00:21:19.070,00:21:21.114,I'm just saying all life has value.
00:21:21.114,00:21:24.324,You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
00:21:25.993,00:21:27.411,My brochure!
00:21:40.800,00:21:43.636,"There you go, little guy."
00:21:47.181,00:21:50.226,"I'm not scared of him, but, it's an allergic thing."
00:21:50.226,00:21:52.895,"ANDY: Hey, why don't you put that on your resume brochure?"
00:21:52.895,00:21:55.064,KEN: That's not funny.
00:21:55.064,00:21:57.275,ANDY: Hmm. Make it one of your special skills.
00:21:57.275,00:22:00.153,"KEN: You know, knocking someone out is also a special skill."
00:22:02.780,00:22:04.157,VANESSA: Right.
00:22:04.157,00:22:05.574,"WOMAN: Bye, Vanessa. Thanks."
00:22:05.574,00:22:07.201,"KEN: Vanessa, next week?"
00:22:07.201,00:22:09.036,"VANESSA: Yeah, sure."
00:22:09.036,00:22:11.164,KEN: You could put carob chips on that.
00:22:11.164,00:22:12.790,Supposed to be less calories or something.
00:22:12.790,00:22:14.333,Bye.
00:22:14.333,00:22:16.752,Oh.
00:22:19.046,00:22:21.215,I gotta say something.
00:22:21.215,00:22:24.593,She saved my life.
00:22:26.470,00:22:28.181,"All right, here goes."
00:22:40.067,00:22:41.485,Nah.
00:22:47.908,00:22:50.077,What would I say?
00:22:52.205,00:22:53.956,I could really get in trouble.
00:22:56.250,00:22:59.712,It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
00:22:59.712,00:23:02.215,I can't believe I'm doing this.
00:23:02.215,00:23:03.632,I've got to.
00:23:03.632,00:23:06.260,"Oh, I can't do it."
00:23:07.178,00:23:09.013,No. Yes. No.
00:23:09.013,00:23:11.515,Do it. I can't.
00:23:11.515,00:23:13.142,How should I start it?
00:23:13.142,00:23:15.561,You like jazz?
00:23:15.561,00:23:18.356,Here she comes!
00:23:18.356,00:23:20.691,"Uh, hi!"
00:23:20.691,00:23:22.484,I'm sorry.
00:23:22.484,00:23:24.195,You're talking.
00:23:24.195,00:23:25.612,I'm so-- You're talking!
00:23:25.612,00:23:27.489,"I know. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry."
00:23:27.489,00:23:30.243,"No, it's okay."
00:23:30.243,00:23:32.995,"I know I'm dreaming, but I don't recall going to bed."
00:23:32.995,00:23:35.622,"Well, you know, I'm sure this is very disconcerting..."
00:23:35.622,00:23:38.584,"Well, yeah, I mean, this is a bit of a surprise to me."
00:23:38.584,00:23:41.087,"I mean, you're a bee!"
00:23:41.087,00:23:46.800,"Yeah. I am a bee and, uh, you know, I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me."
00:23:46.800,00:23:49.262,Uh-huh. Oh.
00:23:49.262,00:23:51.805,"I mean, I had to thank you."
00:23:51.805,00:23:54.267,Oh! Unh!
00:23:54.267,00:23:55.893,That was a little weird.
00:23:55.893,00:23:58.104,I'm talking with a bee.
00:23:58.104,00:23:59.855,I'm talking to a bee.
00:23:59.855,00:24:01.857,And the bee is talking to me!
00:24:01.857,00:24:04.777,"I just want you to know that I'm grateful, and I'm gonna leave now."
00:24:04.777,00:24:06.153,"Oh, wait, wait, wait!"
00:24:06.153,00:24:07.863,How did you learn to do that?
00:24:07.863,00:24:09.115,What?
00:24:07.863,00:24:10.741,That-- That-- The talking thing.
00:24:10.741,00:24:12.201,"Same way you did, I guess."
00:24:12.201,00:24:14.494,"Mama, Dada, honey."
00:24:14.494,00:24:16.038,That's very funny.
00:24:16.038,00:24:17.998,"Yeah, bees are funny."
00:24:17.998,00:24:20.209,"If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with."
00:24:20.209,00:24:21.961,Anyway...
00:24:21.961,00:24:25.089,"Can I, uh, get you something?"
00:24:25.089,00:24:26.673,Like what?
00:24:26.673,00:24:30.386,I don't know. I mean...
00:24:30.386,00:24:33.555,"Well, I don't want to put you out, unless you're making anyway."
00:24:33.555,00:24:35.099,It's no trouble.
00:24:35.099,00:24:36.516,Really?
00:24:36.516,00:24:38.602,I hate to impose.
00:24:38.602,00:24:40.229,"Actually, I would love a cup."
00:24:40.229,00:24:41.688,You want a little rum cake?
00:24:41.688,00:24:43.316,I shouldn't.
00:24:43.316,00:24:45.609,"No, no, no, I can't."
00:24:45.609,00:24:47.820,I'm trying to lose a couple of micrograms here.
00:24:47.820,00:24:49.487,Where?
00:24:49.487,00:24:50.990,You look great!
00:24:50.990,00:24:52.908,I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
00:24:52.908,00:24:55.119,Are you all right?
00:24:55.119,00:24:56.536,No.
00:24:59.123,00:25:02.835,BARRY: He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
00:25:02.835,00:25:04.670,So he finally gets there.
00:25:04.670,00:25:07.214,He runs up the steps into the church.
00:25:07.214,00:25:08.674,The wedding is on.
00:25:08.674,00:25:10.843,"And he says, Watermelon?"
00:25:10.843,00:25:12.845,I thought you said Guatemalan.
00:25:12.845,00:25:14.180,Why would I marry a watermelon?
00:25:18.184,00:25:20.644,Oh! Heh-heh.
00:25:20.644,00:25:23.272,"Is that, uh, a bee joke?"
00:25:23.272,00:25:25.024,"Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that we do."
00:25:25.024,00:25:26.900,"Yeah, different."
00:25:26.900,00:25:29.987,"So, anyway, what are you going to do, Barry?"
00:25:29.987,00:25:32.114,About work?
00:25:32.114,00:25:36.743,"I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want."
00:25:36.743,00:25:38.078,I know how you feel.
00:25:38.078,00:25:40.039,You do?
00:25:40.039,00:25:44.626,"My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist."
00:25:44.626,00:25:47.463,Really?
00:25:47.463,00:25:50.257,Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
00:25:50.257,00:25:52.218,Oh. Hmm.
00:25:52.218,00:25:57.264,"Anyway, uh, you see, if you look-- See, there's my hive right there. You can see it."
00:25:57.264,00:25:59.225,Oh.
00:25:59.225,00:26:01.101,Yes! You know the Turtle Pond?
00:26:01.101,00:26:02.436,Yes.
00:26:02.436,00:26:04.397,"Oh, no way!"
00:26:04.397,00:26:06.106,Do you know I lost a toe ring there once?
00:26:06.106,00:26:07.525,Really?
00:26:07.525,00:26:08.942,Why do girls put rings on their toes?
00:26:08.942,00:26:10.568,VANESSA: Why not?
00:26:10.568,00:26:12.488,BARRY: It's like putting a hat on your knee.
00:26:12.488,00:26:14.865,VANESSA: Maybe I'll try that.
00:26:14.865,00:26:16.742,"Oh, yeah. Fine."
00:26:16.742,00:26:19.786,Just having two cups of coffee! Ha-ha!
00:26:30.672,00:26:32.425,"Uh, ahem."
00:26:32.425,00:26:35.428,"Anyway, this has been great."
00:26:35.428,00:26:37.137,"Oh, yeah, it's no trouble."
00:26:37.137,00:26:38.596,Sorry I couldn't finish it.
00:26:38.596,00:26:40.640,"If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life."
00:26:44.103,00:26:46.021,Can I take a piece of this with me?
00:26:46.021,00:26:48.441,"Sure! Here, have a crumb."
00:26:48.441,00:26:51.985,"Oh, thanks!"
00:26:53.529,00:26:57.032,"All right. Well, then, I guess I'll see you around."
00:26:57.032,00:26:58.451,"Or not, or..."
00:26:58.451,00:27:00.327,"Okay, Barry."
00:27:00.327,00:27:03.456,And thank you so much again for before.
00:27:03.456,00:27:05.416,"Oh, that! That was nothing."
00:27:05.416,00:27:08.294,"Well, not nothing, but..."
00:27:29.565,00:27:31.484,This can't possibly work.
00:27:31.484,00:27:33.902,"Well, he's all set to go."
00:27:33.902,00:27:37.197,"Okay, Dave, pull the chute."
00:27:38.740,00:27:41.868,ADAM: Sounds amazing.
00:27:41.868,00:27:44.413,"It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life."
00:27:44.413,00:27:47.333,Humans! Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
00:27:47.333,00:27:49.835,"Giant, scary humans!"
00:27:49.835,00:27:52.171,Huge and crazy.
00:27:52.171,00:27:54.923,They eat crazy giant things.
00:27:54.923,00:27:56.883,"And do they try and kill you, like on TV?"
00:27:56.883,00:27:58.885,Some of them.
00:27:58.885,00:28:00.554,How'd you get back?
00:28:00.554,00:28:02.680,"Look, you did it, and I'm glad."
00:28:02.680,00:28:04.475,You saw whatever you wanted to see out there.
00:28:04.475,00:28:06.059,You had your experience.
00:28:06.059,00:28:09.480,"And now you're back, you can pick out your job, and everything can be normal."
00:28:09.480,00:28:11.106,Well...
00:28:11.106,00:28:12.399,"Well, I met someone."
00:28:12.399,00:28:14.360,ADAM: You met someone?
00:28:14.360,00:28:17.112,Not a wasp?
00:28:17.112,00:28:18.780,"No, no, no. Not a wasp."
00:28:18.780,00:28:20.574,I'm not attracted to the spiders.
00:28:20.574,00:28:24.995,"I know with everyone else, it's like the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all."
00:28:26.205,00:28:27.873,"So, uh, who is she?"
00:28:27.873,00:28:30.543,She's a human.
00:28:30.543,00:28:33.128,"Oh, no, no, no. That didn't happen. You didn't do that."
00:28:33.128,00:28:35.297,That's a bee law.
00:28:35.297,00:28:37.550,Her name's Vanessa.
00:28:37.550,00:28:40.177,She's so nice.
00:28:40.177,00:28:43.263,"Oh, no, no, no!"
00:28:43.263,00:28:45.974,"Well, we're not dating."
00:28:43.263,00:28:50.521,"You're flying outside the hive, you're talking to human beings that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s!"
00:28:50.521,00:28:52.481,That's one-eighth of a stick of dynamite!
00:28:52.481,00:28:54.441,She saved my life!
00:28:54.441,00:28:56.485,And she understands me.
00:28:56.485,00:28:59.154,This is over!
00:28:59.154,00:29:01.615,This is not over!
00:29:01.615,00:29:02.991,They call it a crumb.
00:29:02.991,00:29:04.577,That was so stingin' stripey!
00:29:04.577,00:29:06.203,And that's not even what they eat.
00:29:06.203,00:29:08.205,That just falls off what they eat!
00:29:08.205,00:29:10.123,Do you know what a Cinnabon is?
00:29:10.123,00:29:11.584,It's bread...
00:29:11.584,00:29:13.210,...and cinnamon and frosting.
00:29:13.210,00:29:14.753,They heat it up...
00:29:14.753,00:29:16.714,...really hot!
00:29:16.714,00:29:19.007,We are not them!
00:29:19.007,00:29:21.051,There's us and there's them!
00:29:21.051,00:29:24.137,"Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?"
00:29:24.137,00:29:27.057,There's no yearning.
00:29:27.057,00:29:31.228,"You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!"
00:29:31.228,00:29:33.105,Thinking bee.
00:29:33.105,00:29:37.150,ALL: Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
00:29:37.150,00:29:39.069,Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
00:29:39.069,00:29:41.572,"JANET: There he is, he's in the pool."
00:29:41.572,00:29:43.907,"You know what your problem is, Barry?"
00:29:43.907,00:29:45.492,I gotta start thinking bee?
00:29:45.492,00:29:47.620,"Barry, how much longer is this going to go on?"
00:29:47.620,00:29:49.079,It's been three days!
00:29:49.079,00:29:51.039,I don't understand why you're not working.
00:29:51.039,00:29:53.875,"Well, I've got a lot of big life decisions I'm thinking about."
00:29:53.875,00:29:55.419,What life?
00:29:55.419,00:29:58.631,You have no job.
00:29:58.631,00:30:00.507,Would it kill you to just make a little honey?
00:30:00.507,00:30:01.883,"Barry, come out from under there."
00:30:01.883,00:30:03.719,Your father's talking to you.
00:30:03.719,00:30:05.512,"Martin, would you talk to him?"
00:30:05.512,00:30:07.139,"MARTIN: Barry, I'm talking to you!"
00:30:35.250,00:30:37.210,You coming?
00:30:37.210,00:30:39.045,Got everything?
00:30:39.045,00:30:41.131,All set!
00:30:41.131,00:30:42.633,You go ahead.
00:30:42.633,00:30:44.217,Don't be too long.
00:30:58.898,00:31:00.484,Watch this!
00:31:12.412,00:31:15.040,Vanessa!
00:31:16.834,00:31:18.043,"We are still here, Barry."
00:31:18.043,00:31:19.628,I told you not to yell at him.
00:31:19.628,00:31:21.797,He doesn't respond when you yell at him.
00:31:21.797,00:31:23.590,Then why are you yelling at me?
00:31:23.590,00:31:25.759,Because you don't listen.
00:31:25.759,00:31:28.011,"Sorry, Mom, I've gotta go."
00:31:28.011,00:31:29.471,Nowhere.
00:31:29.471,00:31:32.265,A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
00:31:32.265,00:31:33.559,Bye.
00:31:33.559,00:31:36.729,I just hope she's Bee-ish.
00:31:39.606,00:31:43.193,So they have a huge parade of just flowers every year in Pasadena?
00:31:43.193,00:31:47.740,"Oh, to be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!"
00:31:47.740,00:31:52.369,"Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering."
00:31:52.369,00:31:53.912,"Wow, a tournament."
00:31:53.912,00:31:55.955,Do the roses actually compete in athletic events?
00:31:55.955,00:31:58.500,"No. All right, I've got one."
00:31:58.500,00:32:00.419,How come you don't fly everywhere?
00:32:00.419,00:32:02.087,It's exhausting.
00:32:02.087,00:32:04.005,Why don't you run everywhere?
00:32:04.005,00:32:06.800,"Yeah, okay, I see, I see."
00:32:06.800,00:32:10.345,"Uh, TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane."
00:32:10.345,00:32:12.138,"What, you don't have anything like that?"
00:32:12.138,00:32:13.973,"We have Hivo, but it's a disease."
00:32:13.973,00:32:16.017,"It's a horrible, horrible disease."
00:32:16.017,00:32:17.770,"Oh, my."
00:32:17.770,00:32:19.479,Oh. Dumb bees!
00:32:19.479,00:32:23.066,You must just wanna sting all those jerks.
00:32:23.066,00:32:26.069,"We really try not to sting, it's usually fatal for us."
00:32:26.069,00:32:28.781,So you really have to watch your temper.
00:32:28.781,00:32:30.657,"Oh, yeah, very carefully."
00:32:30.657,00:32:34.035,"You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out."
00:32:34.035,00:32:36.121,You work through it like any emotion.
00:32:36.121,00:32:39.833,"Anger, jealousy, lust."
00:32:41.042,00:32:43.002,"Oh, my goodness!"
00:32:43.002,00:32:44.337,Yeah.
00:32:44.337,00:32:46.757,What is wrong with you?
00:32:46.757,00:32:48.717,"Well, he's not bothering anybody."
00:32:48.717,00:32:51.136,"Get out of here, you creep!"
00:32:51.136,00:32:53.430,"What was that, a Pick 'n Save circular?"
00:32:53.430,00:32:55.766,"Yeah, it was!"
00:32:55.766,00:32:57.768,"Uh, it felt like about 10 pages."
00:32:57.768,00:32:59.812,Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
00:32:59.812,00:33:01.897,"Boy, you've really got that down to a science."
00:33:01.897,00:33:04.190,"Oh, we have to. I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue."
00:33:04.190,00:33:05.567,"Oh, I'll bet."
00:33:05.567,00:33:08.111,What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?
00:33:08.111,00:33:09.738,How did this get here?
00:33:09.738,00:33:15.577,Cute Bee? Golden Blossom?
00:33:15.577,00:33:17.996,Is he that actor?
00:33:17.996,00:33:19.289,Why is this here?
00:33:19.289,00:33:20.916,For people. We eat it.
00:33:20.916,00:33:23.502,Why? You don't have enough food of your own?
00:33:23.502,00:33:25.378,VANESSA: Yes.
00:33:25.378,00:33:26.797,"Well, bees make it."
00:33:26.797,00:33:28.799,I know who makes it!
00:33:28.799,00:33:30.509,And it's hard to make it!
00:33:30.509,00:33:32.552,There's heating and cooling and stirring.
00:33:32.552,00:33:34.012,You need a whole Krelman thing!
00:33:34.012,00:33:35.347,It's organic.
00:33:35.347,00:33:36.890,It's our-ganic!
00:33:36.890,00:33:38.266,"It's just honey, Barry."
00:33:38.266,00:33:39.852,Just what?
00:33:39.852,00:33:41.394,Bees don't know about this!
00:33:41.394,00:33:43.647,This is stealing!
00:33:43.647,00:33:46.107,"You've taken our homes, our schools, our hospitals!"
00:33:46.107,00:33:48.443,This is all we have!
00:33:48.443,00:33:50.069,And it's on sale?
00:33:50.069,00:33:51.613,I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
00:33:51.613,00:33:53.740,I'm gonna get to the bottom of all of this!
00:34:00.372,00:34:02.374,"MAN: Hey, Hector."
00:34:04.250,00:34:07.295,You almost done?
00:34:08.296,00:34:11.132,He is here. I sense it.
00:34:19.975,00:34:26.439,"Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around."
00:34:26.439,00:34:27.816,"You're busted, box boy!"
00:34:27.816,00:34:29.317,Ah-ha!
00:34:29.317,00:34:31.862,I knew I heard something.
00:34:31.862,00:34:34.531,"Oh, I can talk. And now you're gonna start talking!"
00:34:34.531,00:34:36.282,Where you getting all the sweet stuff?
00:34:36.282,00:34:37.910,Who's your supplier?
00:34:37.910,00:34:39.578,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:34:39.578,00:34:41.287,I thought we were all friends.
00:34:41.287,00:34:43.498,The last thing we want to do is upset any of you bees!
00:34:43.498,00:34:45.667,You're too late!
00:34:46.877,00:34:49.170,"You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!"
00:34:49.170,00:34:52.424,"You, sir, are about to be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!"
00:34:52.424,00:34:54.259,Where is the honey coming from?
00:34:56.511,00:34:58.221,Tell me where!
00:34:58.221,00:35:00.933,Honey Farms!
00:35:06.145,00:35:07.856,Ow!
00:35:23.747,00:35:25.707,Crazy person!
00:35:35.467,00:35:37.218,Huh?
00:36:00.909,00:36:03.829,"Oh, my! What horrible thing has happened here?"
00:36:03.829,00:36:06.623,"Look at these faces, they never knew what hit them."
00:36:06.623,00:36:09.501,And now they're on the road to nowhere!
00:36:09.501,00:36:12.004,Psst. Just keep still!
00:36:12.004,00:36:13.630,What? You're not dead?
00:36:13.630,00:36:15.340,Do I look dead?
00:36:13.630,00:36:17.676,"Hey, man, they will wipe anything that moves. Now where you headed?"
00:36:17.676,00:36:20.762,To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.
00:36:20.762,00:36:23.849,I'm going to Alaska.
00:36:23.849,00:36:25.266,Blows your head off!
00:36:25.266,00:36:28.227,I'm going to Tacoma.
00:36:28.227,00:36:30.689,He really is dead.
00:36:30.689,00:36:31.982,Uh-oh.
00:36:31.982,00:36:34.067,BARRY: What is that?
00:36:34.067,00:36:36.361,It's a wiper! Triple blade!
00:36:36.361,00:36:39.031,Jump on!
00:36:39.031,00:36:43.076,Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?
00:36:43.076,00:36:45.662,How much do you people need to see?
00:36:45.662,00:36:48.414,Open your eyes!
00:36:48.414,00:36:51.793,"From NPR News in Washington, I'm Carl Kasell."
00:36:51.793,00:36:54.671,MOOSEBLOOD: But don't kill no more bugs!
00:36:56.297,00:36:57.799,MOOSEBLOOD: Bee!
00:36:57.799,00:36:59.258,Mooseblood guy!
00:37:08.226,00:37:09.853,You hear something?
00:37:09.853,00:37:11.688,Like tiny screaming.
00:37:11.688,00:37:13.899,Turn off the radio.
00:37:19.946,00:37:21.907,Ah-ha!
00:37:24.617,00:37:26.703,"MOOSEBLOOD: Hey, what's up, bee boy?"
00:37:26.703,00:37:28.454,"BARRY: Hey, Blood."
00:37:28.454,00:37:33.210,"And it was just an endless row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see."
00:37:33.210,00:37:37.214,"So I'm just assuming wherever this honey truck goes, that's where they're getting it."
00:37:37.214,00:37:38.548,"I mean, that honey's ours."
00:37:38.548,00:37:40.383,Bees hang tight.
00:37:40.383,00:37:42.594,"Well, we're all jammed in there."
00:37:42.594,00:37:46.514,"Not us, man. We on our own."
00:37:46.514,00:37:47.849,"Well, what if you get in trouble?"
00:37:47.849,00:37:50.227,"Trouble? You a mosquito, you in trouble."
00:37:50.227,00:37:51.895,Nobody likes us.
00:37:51.895,00:37:53.646,"People see a mosquito, smack, smack!"
00:37:53.646,00:37:55.356,At least you're out in the world.
00:37:55.356,00:37:56.691,You must meet a lot of girls.
00:37:56.691,00:38:01.071,"Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly."
00:38:01.071,00:38:03.156,Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
00:38:03.156,00:38:06.492,Whoa! You got to be kidding me!
00:38:06.492,00:38:08.828,Mooseblood's about to leave the building!
00:38:08.828,00:38:10.538,"So long, bee!"
00:38:10.538,00:38:12.540,Hey guys!
00:38:12.540,00:38:14.542,MOOSEBLOOD: I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
00:38:14.542,00:38:17.712,Did you bring your crazy straw?
00:38:33.561,00:38:37.107,"MAN 1: Then we throw it in some jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit."
00:38:37.107,00:38:38.817,What is this place?
00:38:38.817,00:38:41.194,MAN 2: A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.
00:38:41.194,00:38:42.821,MAN 1: They are pinheads!
00:38:44.030,00:38:45.949,MAN 2: Pinhead.
00:38:45.949,00:38:47.533,"Hey, check out the new smoker."
00:38:47.533,00:38:49.702,"Oh, sweet."
00:38:49.702,00:38:51.412,The Thomas 3000!
00:38:51.412,00:38:52.956,Smoker?
00:38:52.956,00:38:54.624,"Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic."
00:38:54.624,00:38:57.085,"Twice the nicotine, all the tar."
00:38:58.544,00:39:00.964,A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.
00:39:03.758,00:39:07.470,"They make the honey, and we make the money."
00:39:07.470,00:39:10.140,"They make the honey, and we make the money?"
00:39:30.576,00:39:32.537,"Oh, my!"
00:39:34.289,00:39:37.000,What's going on?
00:39:37.000,00:39:39.252,Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
00:39:39.252,00:39:41.171,How did all these bees get here?
00:39:41.171,00:39:43.215,Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?
00:39:43.215,00:39:45.717,Our queen was moved here.
00:39:45.717,00:39:49.512,This is your queen?
00:39:49.512,00:39:51.890,That's a drag queen!
00:39:55.476,00:39:58.563,What is this?
00:40:05.987,00:40:09.699,"Oh, no!"
00:40:20.126,00:40:21.544,Bee honey.
00:40:21.544,00:40:26.341,Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!
00:40:26.341,00:40:28.760,This is worse than anything the bears have done to us!
00:40:28.760,00:40:30.387,And I intend to do something about it.
00:40:30.387,00:40:31.804,"Oh, Barry, stop."
00:40:31.804,00:40:33.765,Who told you that humans are taking our honey?
00:40:33.765,00:40:35.100,That's just a rumor.
00:40:35.100,00:40:36.935,Do these look like rumors?
00:40:36.935,00:40:38.395,That's a conspiracy theory.
00:40:38.395,00:40:40.605,These are obviously doctored photos.
00:40:40.605,00:40:42.982,"Barry, how did you get mixed up in all this?"
00:40:42.982,00:40:44.483,'Cause he's been talking to humans.
00:40:44.483,00:40:46.111,What?
00:40:46.111,00:40:48.071,He has a human girlfriend.
00:40:48.071,00:40:49.530,And they make out!
00:40:49.530,00:40:50.782,Make out? Barry!
00:40:50.782,00:40:52.909,We do not.
00:40:52.909,00:40:55.536,Whose side are you on?
00:40:55.536,00:40:57.496,I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
00:40:57.496,00:41:00.666,"Man, those crazy legs kept me up all night."
00:41:00.666,00:41:03.128,"Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?"
00:41:03.128,00:41:05.213,This is what I want to do for all our lives.
00:41:05.213,00:41:07.048,Nobody works harder than bees.
00:41:07.048,00:41:12.678,"Dad, I remember you coming home some nights so overworked your hands were still stirring, you couldn't stop them."
00:41:12.678,00:41:14.264,I remember that.
00:41:14.264,00:41:16.891,What right do they have to our hard-earned honey?
00:41:16.891,00:41:18.643,We're living on two cups a year.
00:41:18.643,00:41:20.979,They're putting it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
00:41:20.979,00:41:23.648,"Even if it's true, Barry, what could one bee do?"
00:41:23.648,00:41:25.483,I'm gonna sting them where it really hurts.
00:41:25.483,00:41:26.859,In the face!
00:41:26.859,00:41:28.278,The eye! That would hurt.
00:41:28.278,00:41:29.904,Up the nose?
00:41:29.904,00:41:34.617,"There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it really matters."
00:41:34.617,00:41:39.331,"ANNOUNCER: Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source."
00:41:44.169,00:41:45.878,ALL: No more bee beards!
00:41:48.506,00:41:51.050,ANNOUNCER: With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.
00:41:51.050,00:41:52.844,Weather with Storm Stinger.

00:41:54.512,00:41:56.681,And Jeanette Chung.
00:41:58.641,00:42:00.143,Good evening.
00:42:00.143,00:42:01.519,And I'm Jeanette Chung.
00:42:01.519,00:42:10.820,"Our top story, a tri-county bee, Barry Benson, is saying he intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!"
00:42:13.490,00:42:24.292,"Don't forget, tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we're gonna have three former queens all right here in our studio, discussing their new book, Classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon."
00:42:24.292,00:42:26.169,Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
00:42:26.169,00:42:30.298,"Did you ever think, I'm just a kid from the hive."
00:42:30.298,00:42:32.842,"Larry, bees have never been afraid to change the world."
00:42:32.842,00:42:34.552,"I mean, what about Bee Columbus?"
00:42:34.552,00:42:36.346,Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
00:42:36.346,00:42:38.931,"Well, where I'm from, you wouldn't think of suing humans."
00:42:38.931,00:42:42.185,"We were thinking more like stickball, candy stores."
00:42:42.185,00:42:43.561,How old are you?
00:42:43.561,00:42:49.275,"I want you to know the entire bee community is supporting you in this case, which is certain to be the trial of the bee century."
00:42:49.275,00:42:50.902,"Thank you, Larry."
00:42:50.902,00:42:52.904,"You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too."
00:42:52.904,00:42:55.990,It's a common name.
00:42:52.904,00:43:00.370,"Next week on Bee Larry King-- No, no, I mean, he looks like you and he has a show with suspenders and different colored dots behind him."
00:43:00.370,00:43:06.625,"Next week on Bee Larry-- He's got old guy glasses and there's quotes along the bottom from the guest, even though you just heard him."
00:43:06.625,00:43:08.627,Bear Week next week!
00:43:06.625,00:43:10.588,"They're scary, they're hairy and they're here live."
00:43:10.588,00:43:15.718,"Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish."
00:43:17.262,00:43:21.724,"In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!"
00:43:21.724,00:43:24.936,"But it was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81."
00:43:24.936,00:43:27.522,"Ha. Honey, her backhand's a joke!"
00:43:27.522,00:43:29.648,I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
00:43:29.648,00:43:32.193,"BARRY: Quiet, please."
00:43:32.193,00:43:34.237,Is that that same bee?
00:43:34.237,00:43:35.738,"BARRY: Yes, it is!"
00:43:35.738,00:43:37.656,I'm helping him sue the human race.
00:43:37.656,00:43:40.243,What?
00:43:40.243,00:43:41.619,"Hello, bee."
00:43:41.619,00:43:42.870,This is Ken.
00:43:42.870,00:43:44.205,"Yeah, I remember you."
00:43:44.205,00:43:46.165,"Timberland, size 10-and-a-half."
00:43:46.165,00:43:48.126,"Vibram sole, I believe."
00:43:48.126,00:43:50.628,Why does he talk again?
00:43:50.628,00:43:53.672,"Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working."
00:43:53.672,00:43:54.966,But it's our yogurt night!
00:43:54.966,00:43:57.676,Oh. Bye-bye.
00:43:57.676,00:44:00.638,Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
00:44:02.181,00:44:05.560,"Oh, you poor thing. You two have been at this for hours."
00:44:05.560,00:44:07.895,"Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help."
00:44:07.895,00:44:10.231,"Frosting, frosting."
00:44:10.231,00:44:12.317,How many sugars?
00:44:12.317,00:44:14.777,I try not to use the competition. Ooh.
00:44:14.777,00:44:17.280,So why are you helping me anyway?
00:44:17.280,00:44:19.407,Bees have good qualities.
00:44:20.908,00:44:23.035,And it feels good to take my mind off the shop.
00:44:23.035,00:44:27.206,"I don't know why, but instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now."
00:44:27.206,00:44:29.750,"Yeah, those are great, if you're 3."
00:44:29.750,00:44:31.419,And artificial flowers.
00:44:31.419,00:44:34.088,"Oh, those just get me psychotic!"
00:44:34.088,00:44:35.423,"Yeah, me, too."
00:44:35.423,00:44:37.842,"The bent stingers, the pointless pollination."
00:44:37.842,00:44:40.052,Bees must hate those fake plastic things!
00:44:40.052,00:44:42.639,There's nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.
00:44:42.639,00:44:45.891,"Well, maybe this could make up for it a little bit."
00:44:45.891,00:44:47.268,This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
00:44:47.268,00:44:48.853,BARRY: I guess.
00:44:48.853,00:44:51.272,Are you sure that you want to go through with it?
00:44:51.272,00:44:57.654,"Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, Honey, I'm home, without paying a royalty!"
00:45:00.281,00:45:12.377,"Sarah, it's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan where all eyes and ears of the world are anxiously waiting because for the first time in history, we're going to hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak."
00:45:16.964,00:45:19.258,"What have we gotten into here, Barry?"
00:45:19.258,00:45:21.177,"I don't know. But it's pretty big, isn't it?"
00:45:21.177,00:45:24.430,I can't believe how many humans don't have to be at work during the day.
00:45:24.430,00:45:28.643,"Hey, you think these billion dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?"
00:45:28.643,00:45:33.064,"Folks, everybody needs to stay back behind the barricade."
00:45:43.115,00:45:44.992,Ooh.
00:45:44.992,00:45:46.827,I don't know.
00:45:53.251,00:45:56.837,"Well, if it isn't the bee team."
00:45:56.837,00:45:58.464,Any of you boys work on this?
00:46:01.551,00:46:02.968,BAILIFF: All rise!
00:46:02.968,00:46:05.179,The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.
00:46:05.179,00:46:09.766,JUDGE: All right. Case number 4475.
00:46:05.179,00:46:14.272,"Superior Court of New York, Barry Bee Benson vs. the Honey Industry is now in session."
00:46:14.272,00:46:18.984,"Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five major food companies collectively?"
00:46:18.984,00:46:20.777,A privilege.
00:46:20.777,00:46:23.780,"JUDGE: Uh, Mr. Benson."
00:46:23.780,00:46:26.409,You're representing all bees of the world?
00:46:37.002,00:46:38.337,"I'm kidding, I'm kidding."
00:46:38.337,00:46:40.047,"Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed."
00:46:41.674,00:46:45.303,"And, Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please."
00:46:48.306,00:46:54.019,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman."
00:46:54.019,00:47:03.070,"Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us."
00:47:03.070,00:47:09.034,"If we were to live in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what it would mean?"
00:47:09.034,00:47:14.707,Maybe I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!
00:47:16.125,00:47:17.710,Talking bee!
00:47:17.710,00:47:24.133,How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?
00:47:24.133,00:47:26.719,They could be using laser beams!
00:47:26.719,00:47:30.222,Robotics!
00:47:30.222,00:47:34.268,For all we know he could be on steroids!
00:47:34.268,00:47:35.645,"Oh, yes, he must."
00:47:35.645,00:47:37.689,JUDGE: Mr. Benson?
00:47:43.695,00:47:46.113,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there's no trickery here."
00:47:46.113,00:47:47.824,I'm just an ordinary bee.
00:47:47.824,00:47:50.368,"And as a bee, honey's pretty important to me."
00:47:50.368,00:47:52.869,It's important to all bees.
00:47:52.869,00:47:56.290,"We make it, and we protect it with our lives."
00:47:56.290,00:48:02.380,"Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take whatever they want from us 'cause we're the little guys!"
00:48:02.380,00:48:11.888,"And what I'm hoping is that after this is all over you'll see how, by taking our honey, you're not only taking away everything we have but everything we are!"
00:48:14.933,00:48:18.312,"Oh, I wish he would dress like that all the time. So nice."
00:48:18.312,00:48:20.231,Call your first witness.
00:48:20.231,00:48:23.234,"So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms."
00:48:23.234,00:48:25.027,Pretty big company you have there.
00:48:25.027,00:48:27.780,I suppose so.
00:48:25.027,00:48:30.199,And I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!
00:48:30.199,00:48:33.160,"Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms."
00:48:33.160,00:48:36.664,"Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term, I have to say."
00:48:36.664,00:48:40.167,"I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?"
00:48:40.167,00:48:42.503,"Uh, no."
00:48:42.503,00:48:44.296,No.
00:48:44.296,00:48:47.258,"Because you don't free bees, you keep bees."
00:48:47.258,00:48:52.680,"And not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey."
00:48:52.680,00:48:55.600,"Well, they're very lovable creatures."
00:48:55.600,00:48:59.061,"Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear."
00:48:59.061,00:49:00.855,"Yeah, you mean like this?"
00:49:04.108,00:49:06.026,Bears kill bees!
00:49:06.026,00:49:09.906,How'd you like his big hairy head crashing through your living room?
00:49:09.906,00:49:12.199,Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!
00:49:13.992,00:49:16.953,"Okay, that's enough."
00:49:22.042,00:49:24.670,"So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here."
00:49:24.670,00:49:26.714,"Your name intrigues me, I have to say."
00:49:26.714,00:49:28.048,Where have I heard it before?
00:49:28.048,00:49:29.966,I was with a band called The Police.
00:49:29.966,00:49:32.678,"But you've never been a police officer of any kind, have you?"
00:49:32.678,00:49:35.264,"No, I haven't."
00:49:35.264,00:49:43.272,And so here we have yet another example of bee culture being casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.
00:49:43.272,00:49:44.523,"Oh, please."
00:49:44.523,00:49:46.859,"Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?"
00:49:46.859,00:49:49.403,"Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting."
00:49:49.403,00:49:53.866,"Or should I say, Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!"
00:49:55.284,00:49:57.328,That's not his real name?
00:49:58.913,00:50:05.628,"Mr. Liotta, first may I offer my belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005."
00:50:05.628,00:50:08.506,Thank you. Thank you.
00:50:08.506,00:50:15.137,"I also see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome, but with a churning inner turmoil that's always ready to blow."
00:50:15.137,00:50:17.807,I enjoy what I do.
00:50:17.807,00:50:21.017,"Not yet it isn't, but is this what it's come to for you?"
00:50:21.017,00:50:27.566,"Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?"
00:50:27.566,00:50:30.026,"Watch it, Benson!"
00:50:30.026,00:50:33.113,This isn't a goodfella.
00:50:34.615,00:50:37.910,Why doesn't someone step on this little creep so we can all go home?
00:50:37.910,00:50:39.244,JUDGE: Order in this courtroom.
00:50:39.244,00:50:40.663,You're all thinking it!
00:50:40.663,00:50:42.414,"JUDGE: Order! Order, I say!"
00:50:42.414,00:50:44.750,"Mr. Liotta, will you please sit down!"
00:50:49.755,00:50:53.718,"BARRY: Well, I just think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that."
00:50:53.718,00:50:56.303,"I'm telling you, I think the jury's on our side."
00:50:56.303,00:50:59.181,"Are we doing everything right, you know, legally?"
00:50:59.181,00:51:02.142,I'm a florist.
00:51:02.142,00:51:04.144,"Well, here's to a great team."
00:51:04.144,00:51:05.688,To a great team!
00:51:07.565,00:51:09.191,"Well, hello."
00:51:09.191,00:51:11.318,"Oh, Ken!"
00:51:11.318,00:51:13.320,"Uh, I didn't think you were coming."
00:51:13.320,00:51:18.492,"No, I was just late. I tried to call, but the battery..."
00:51:18.492,00:51:21.579,"I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry."
00:51:21.579,00:51:23.664,"Luckily, he was free."
00:51:23.664,00:51:27.292,"Oh, that was lucky."
00:51:27.292,00:51:31.005,"Well, there's still a little left. I could heat it up."
00:51:31.005,00:51:33.215,"Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever."
00:51:37.093,00:51:40.305,"So, I hear you're quite a tennis player."
00:51:40.305,00:51:41.849,I'm not much for the game myself.
00:51:41.849,00:51:43.601,I find the ball a little grabby.
00:51:45.895,00:51:49.774,That's where I usually sit.
00:51:49.774,00:51:51.567,Mmm...
00:51:51.567,00:52:00.076,"VANESSA: Ken, Barry was looking at your resume and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill."
00:52:00.076,00:52:02.787,You think I don't see what you're doing?
00:52:02.787,00:52:05.121,I know how hard it is trying to find the right job.
00:52:05.121,00:52:06.707,We certainly have that in common.
00:52:06.707,00:52:08.751,Do we?
00:52:08.751,00:52:13.255,"Bees have 100 percent employment, of course, but we do jobs like taking the crud out."
00:52:13.255,00:52:15.800,That's just what I was thinking about doing.
00:52:15.800,00:52:19.887,"VANESSA: Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz."
00:52:19.887,00:52:21.722,I hope that was all right.
00:52:21.722,00:52:23.181,Oh!
00:52:25.684,00:52:27.645,I'm gonna go drain the old stinger.
00:52:27.645,00:52:29.730,"Yeah, you do that."
00:52:32.441,00:52:34.777,Look at that.
00:52:43.535,00:52:49.458,"You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games."
00:52:49.458,00:52:52.086,What's that?
00:52:52.086,00:52:53.921,"Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages."
00:52:53.921,00:52:55.506,It's a lot of ads.
00:52:55.506,00:52:58.717,"Remember what Van said, why is your life any more valuable than mine?"
00:52:58.717,00:53:01.512,"That's funny, I just can't seem to recall that!"
00:53:02.763,00:53:06.182,I think something stinks in here!
00:53:06.182,00:53:07.768,I love the smell of flowers.
00:53:07.768,00:53:10.771,Yeah? How do you like the smell of flames?
00:53:10.771,00:53:12.439,Not as much.
00:53:15.567,00:53:16.819,Whoa!
00:53:28.039,00:53:29.832,Waterbug! Not taking sides.
00:53:31.625,00:53:33.836,"Ken, look at me."
00:53:33.836,00:53:35.379,This is pathetic!
00:53:35.379,00:53:37.131,I've got issues!
00:53:41.385,00:53:44.513,"Well, well, well, a royal flush!"
00:53:44.513,00:53:46.724,You're bluffing.
00:53:55.524,00:53:57.068,Yeah!
00:53:57.068,00:53:58.485,"Surf's up, dude!"
00:53:58.485,00:53:59.820,Ew! Poo water!
00:54:03.908,00:54:05.241,That bowl is gnarly.
00:54:05.241,00:54:09.287,Except for those dirty yellow rings!
00:54:09.287,00:54:11.331,Kenneth!
00:54:11.331,00:54:15.044,You know what? I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!
00:54:15.044,00:54:16.837,We need to talk!
00:54:16.837,00:54:18.672,He's just a little bee!
00:54:18.672,00:54:24.011,And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
00:54:24.011,00:54:27.139,Long time?
00:54:27.139,00:54:29.016,Are there other bugs in your life?
00:54:29.016,00:54:32.436,"No, but there are other things bugging me in life."
00:54:32.436,00:54:34.312,And you're one of them!
00:54:34.312,00:54:37.566,"Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night."
00:54:37.566,00:54:41.779,My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!
00:54:41.779,00:54:43.363,"Goodbye, Ken."
00:54:47.243,00:54:54.290,"And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!"
00:54:55.333,00:54:57.711,I'm sorry about all that.
00:54:57.711,00:55:02.758,I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!
00:55:02.758,00:55:06.262,I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.
00:55:06.262,00:55:08.973,I couldn't overcome it.
00:55:08.973,00:55:10.849,You gonna be okay for the trial tomorrow?
00:55:10.849,00:55:14.686,"Oh, I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas."
00:55:14.686,00:55:18.440,We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
00:55:18.440,00:55:20.442,Now that's a good idea!
00:55:18.440,00:55:24.529,You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers-- Uh... Yeah.
00:55:25.864,00:55:27.449,Ah. Ow.
00:55:27.449,00:55:31.036,"Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury or it's gonna be all over."
00:55:31.036,00:55:33.038,"Oh, don't worry, Mr. Gammel."
00:55:33.038,00:55:39.795,The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.
00:55:39.795,00:55:42.089,You got the tweezers?
00:55:42.089,00:55:44.842,"Only to losing, son."
00:55:44.842,00:55:49.847,"Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know."
00:55:49.847,00:55:54.559,What exactly is your relationship to that woman?
00:55:56.520,00:55:58.981,We're friends. Yes.
00:55:58.981,00:56:02.734,How good?
00:56:02.734,00:56:08.324,"Wait a minute. This isn't-- Are you her little, ahem, bedbug?"
00:56:04.945,00:56:09.908,"Hey, that's not the kind of-- I've seen a bee documentary or two."
00:56:09.908,00:56:14.746,"Now, from what I understand doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children in the hives?"
00:56:14.746,00:56:18.500,"Yeah, but-- So those aren't even your real parents!"
00:56:18.500,00:56:20.502,"Oh, Barry."
00:56:20.502,00:56:22.004,Hold me back!
00:56:22.004,00:56:25.007,"You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you?"
00:56:25.007,00:56:26.382,He's denouncing bees!
00:56:26.382,00:56:28.969,And don't y'all date your cousins?
00:56:28.969,00:56:31.680,Objection!
00:56:35.142,00:56:37.353,"Adam, don't!"
00:56:41.982,00:56:44.609,Oh! I'm hit!
00:56:44.609,00:56:46.320,"Oh, lordy, I am hit!"
00:56:46.320,00:56:48.072,JUDGE: Order! Order!
00:56:48.072,00:56:50.199,The venom is coursing through my veins!
00:56:50.199,00:56:51.867,"Please, Mr. Montgomery."
00:56:51.867,00:56:55.495,I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!
00:56:55.495,00:56:58.207,You see? You can't treat them like equals!
00:56:58.207,00:57:00.167,They're striped savages!
00:57:00.167,00:57:04.922,Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!
00:57:04.922,00:57:07.966,"Adam, stay with me."
00:57:07.966,00:57:14.806,Oh! What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks?
00:57:14.806,00:57:18.310,JUDGE: Please! I will have order in my court.
00:57:18.310,00:57:20.145,"Order! Order, please!"
00:57:22.522,00:57:25.984,The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn...
00:57:25.984,00:57:27.945,Thank you.
00:57:25.984,00:57:30.781,...against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
00:57:30.781,00:57:32.908,"Now, here's Don with the five day."
00:57:46.338,00:57:48.215,"Hey, buddy."
00:57:48.215,00:57:49.549,Is there much pain?
00:57:49.549,00:57:51.051,Yeah.
00:57:52.594,00:57:53.804,"I, uh..."
00:57:53.804,00:57:56.140,"I blew the whole case, didn't I?"
00:57:56.140,00:57:58.934,"Oh, it doesn't matter. The important thing is you're alive."
00:57:58.934,00:58:00.269,You could've died.
00:58:00.269,00:58:01.895,I'd be better off dead.
00:58:01.895,00:58:05.065,They got it from the cafeteria.
00:58:05.065,00:58:08.193,"They got it from downstairs, in a tuna sandwich."
00:58:08.193,00:58:11.363,"Look, there's a little celery still on it."
00:58:11.363,00:58:14.032,What was it like to sting someone?
00:58:14.032,00:58:16.201,I can't explain it.
00:58:16.201,00:58:19.913,All adrenaline and then ecstasy!
00:58:22.082,00:58:24.001,"Hmm, all right."
00:58:24.001,00:58:26.128,You think it was all a trap?
00:58:26.128,00:58:29.340,Of course. I'm sorry.
00:58:29.340,00:58:31.508,What were we thinking?
00:58:31.508,00:58:34.011,We're just a couple of bugs in this world.
00:58:34.011,00:58:36.554,What do you think the humans will do to us if they win?
00:58:36.554,00:58:37.889,I don't know.
00:58:37.889,00:58:39.557,I hear they put the roaches in motels.
00:58:39.557,00:58:41.310,That doesn't sound so bad.
00:58:41.310,00:58:45.147,"Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!"
00:58:45.147,00:58:46.564,"Oh, my."
00:58:48.566,00:58:51.403,"Say, could you get a nurse to close that window?"
00:58:51.403,00:58:53.322,BARRY: Why?
00:58:53.322,00:58:55.699,Bees don't smoke.
00:58:55.699,00:58:57.742,Right. Bees don't smoke.
00:58:59.244,00:59:02.873,Bees don't smoke!
00:59:02.873,00:59:05.334,"Adam, that's it!"
00:59:05.334,00:59:06.835,It is? It's not over?
00:59:06.835,00:59:09.338,"No, get up. Get dressed."
00:59:09.338,00:59:12.716,You get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.
00:59:15.302,00:59:20.098,"And, assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub."
00:59:25.687,00:59:26.897,Mr. Flayman.
00:59:26.897,00:59:28.732,Yes? Yes.
00:59:28.732,00:59:31.026,JUDGE: Where is the rest of your team?
00:59:31.026,00:59:33.904,"Uh, well, well, Your Honor, it's interesting."
00:59:33.904,00:59:39.576,"You know, bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result, quite often we don't make very good time."
00:59:39.576,00:59:47.584,"Actually, I once heard a pretty funny story about a bee-- Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time?"
00:59:47.584,00:59:52.714,How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?
00:59:52.714,01:00:01.223,"They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who all run perfectly legitimate businesses."
01:00:01.223,01:00:05.227,I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case.
01:00:05.227,01:00:09.940,"Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion."
01:00:09.940,01:00:12.276,But you can't!
01:00:12.276,01:00:15.112,Where is your proof?
01:00:15.112,01:00:18.574,Show me the smoking gun!
01:00:18.574,01:00:21.952,"Hold it, Your Honor!"
01:00:21.952,01:00:24.913,Here is your smoking gun.
01:00:27.165,01:00:28.750,What is that?
01:00:28.750,01:00:30.502,It's a bee smoker!
01:00:30.502,01:00:33.380,"What, this? This harmless little contraption?"
01:00:33.380,01:00:36.800,"This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee."
01:00:41.388,01:00:42.973,Oh. Hee.
01:00:42.973,01:00:49.646,"Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, Smoking or Non?"
01:00:49.646,01:00:52.023,Is this what nature intended for us?
01:00:52.023,01:00:57.195,"To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in manmade, wooden-slat work camps?"
01:00:57.195,01:01:02.033,Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?
01:01:04.911,01:01:06.204,What are we gonna do?
01:01:06.204,01:01:07.705,He's playing the species card.
01:01:07.705,01:01:12.294,"Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!"
01:01:12.294,01:01:15.839,Free the bees! Free the bees!
01:01:15.839,01:01:20.177,Free the bees! Free the bees!
01:01:20.177,01:01:24.348,The court finds in favor of the bees!
01:01:24.348,01:01:25.723,"Vanessa, we won!"
01:01:25.723,01:01:29.353,Yay! I knew you could do it! High-five!
01:01:29.353,01:01:31.229,Ow!
01:01:31.229,01:01:34.232,"I'm okay! Vanessa, do you know what this means?"
01:01:34.232,01:01:36.610,All the honey is finally gonna belong to the bees.
01:01:36.610,01:01:39.279,Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.
01:01:41.990,01:01:46.036,"This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson."
01:01:46.036,01:01:48.121,You'll regret this.
01:01:48.121,01:01:51.916,"MAN: Barry, how much honey do you think is out there?"
01:01:51.916,01:01:53.251,All right. One at a time.
01:01:53.251,01:01:55.212,"Barry, who are you wearing?"
01:01:55.212,01:01:57.839,"My sweater's Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants."
01:01:57.839,01:02:00.758,What if Montgomery's right?
01:02:00.758,01:02:05.305,"We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years."
01:02:06.806,01:02:08.766,WOMAN: Congratulations on your victory.
01:02:08.766,01:02:11.269,What are you going to demand as a settlement?
01:02:11.269,01:02:14.939,"BARRY: First, we're gonna demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps."
01:02:17.150,01:02:21.488,"Then, we want to get back all the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop."
01:02:21.488,01:02:29.204,"We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bigheaded, bad-breath stink machine."
01:02:29.204,01:02:32.082,I believe we're all aware of what they do in the woods.
01:02:32.082,01:02:34.292,Wait for my signal.
01:02:36.253,01:02:37.879,BARRY: Take him out.
01:02:39.423,01:02:42.008,"He'll have a little nausea, then he'll be fine."
01:02:42.008,01:02:46.096,"BARRY: And we will no longer tolerate derogatory, bee-negative nicknames."
01:02:46.096,01:02:47.723,But it's just a prance-about stage name!
01:02:47.723,01:02:54.771,BARRY: Unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human teatime snack garnishments.
01:02:56.690,01:02:58.108,I can't breathe.
01:03:00.444,01:03:02.446,"Bring it in, boys!"
01:03:04.155,01:03:06.533,MAN: Hold it right there! Good.
01:03:08.285,01:03:09.578,Tap it.
01:03:13.790,01:03:18.128,"Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups and there's gallons more coming!"
01:03:18.128,01:03:19.713,I think we need to shut down!
01:03:19.713,01:03:21.590,Shut down?
01:03:23.216,01:03:25.427,Shut down honey production!
01:03:25.427,01:03:27.429,Stop making honey!
01:03:31.767,01:03:33.518,"Turn your key, sir!"
01:03:44.988,01:03:46.239,What do we do now?
01:03:46.239,01:03:47.949,Hmm?
01:03:50.661,01:03:53.079,Cannonball! Whoo!
01:04:00.003,01:04:03.214,We're shutting down honey production! Mission abort.
01:04:03.214,01:04:05.216,Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
01:04:05.216,01:04:06.968,Returning to base.
01:04:54.641,01:04:57.227,"Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there."
01:04:57.227,01:04:58.770,"Oh, yeah?"
01:04:58.770,01:05:01.939,What's going on around here?
01:05:01.939,01:05:03.692,Are they out celebrating?
01:05:03.692,01:05:05.861,"No, they're just home."
01:05:05.861,01:05:07.863,They're laying out.
01:05:07.863,01:05:11.157,I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.
01:05:11.157,01:05:12.576,At least we got our honey back.
01:05:12.576,01:05:15.829,"Yeah, but sometimes I think, so what if the humans liked our honey?"
01:05:15.829,01:05:18.331,Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world!
01:05:18.331,01:05:20.584,I was excited to be a part of making it.
01:05:22.460,01:05:25.589,This was my new desk.
01:05:25.589,01:05:28.091,I wanted to do it really well. And now...
01:05:29.676,01:05:31.302,Now I can't.
01:05:41.605,01:05:43.690,BARRY: I don't understand why they're not happy.
01:05:43.690,01:05:46.276,We have so much now. I thought their lives would be better!
01:05:46.276,01:05:48.069,Uh-huh.
01:05:48.069,01:05:50.697,It's amazing.
01:05:50.697,01:05:53.742,"You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?"
01:05:53.742,01:05:55.326,What did you want to show me?
01:05:55.326,01:05:57.621,This.
01:05:57.621,01:05:59.831,Oh. What happened here?
01:05:59.831,01:06:02.125,That is not the half of it.
01:06:08.506,01:06:10.550,"BARRY: Oh, no. Oh, my."
01:06:10.550,01:06:12.969,They're all wilting.
01:06:12.969,01:06:15.221,"VANESSA: Doesn't look very good, does it?"
01:06:15.221,01:06:16.807,No.
01:06:16.807,01:06:19.643,And whose fault do you think that is?
01:06:19.643,01:06:21.978,Hmm...
01:06:21.978,01:06:23.814,"You know, I'm gonna guess bees."
01:06:23.814,01:06:25.106,Bees?
01:06:25.106,01:06:27.150,"Specifically, me."
01:06:27.150,01:06:31.321,I didn't think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these other things.
01:06:31.321,01:06:33.030,It's not just flowers.
01:06:33.030,01:06:36.326,"Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees."
01:06:36.326,01:06:39.329,"Well, that's our whole SAT test right there."
01:06:39.329,01:06:43.124,"So you take away the produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom."
01:06:43.124,01:06:44.501,"And then, of course..."
01:06:44.501,01:06:46.461,The human species?
01:06:47.838,01:06:49.714,Oh.
01:06:49.714,01:06:54.385,"So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it?"
01:06:54.385,01:06:57.848,And I know this is also partly my fault.
01:07:01.351,01:07:04.312,How about a suicide pact?
01:07:04.312,01:07:05.772,How do we do it?
01:07:05.772,01:07:07.315,"I'll sting you, you step on me."
01:07:07.315,01:07:08.817,That just kills you twice.
01:07:08.817,01:07:10.401,Right. Right.
01:07:10.401,01:07:15.448,"Listen, Barry, sorry, but I gotta get going."
01:07:21.955,01:07:24.374,I had to open my mouth and talk.
01:07:26.960,01:07:28.419,Vanessa?
01:07:31.589,01:07:34.467,Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
01:07:34.467,01:07:37.595,To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.
01:07:37.595,01:07:41.432,They've moved it up to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.
01:07:41.432,01:07:44.895,It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.
01:07:44.895,01:07:47.022,"Vanessa, I just want to say, I'm sorry."
01:07:47.022,01:07:49.482,I never meant it to turn out like this.
01:07:49.482,01:07:51.568,"I know. Me, neither."
01:07:53.904,01:07:57.323,Tournament of Roses.
01:07:58.616,01:08:02.119,Wait a minute.
01:08:02.119,01:08:04.581,Roses!
01:08:04.581,01:08:06.958,Vanessa!
01:08:06.958,01:08:08.251,Roses?
01:08:08.251,01:08:10.211,Barry?
01:08:10.211,01:08:11.838,Roses are flowers!
01:08:11.838,01:08:13.339,"Yes, they are."
01:08:13.339,01:08:16.384,"Flowers, bees, pollen!"
01:08:16.384,01:08:19.846,I know. That's why this is the last parade.
01:08:19.846,01:08:24.017,Maybe not. Could you ask him to slow down?
01:08:24.017,01:08:25.685,Could you slow down?
01:08:25.685,01:08:28.229,Ow!
01:08:28.229,01:08:29.898,Barry!
01:08:29.898,01:08:31.441,"Okay, I made a huge mistake."
01:08:31.441,01:08:33.443,This is a total disaster and it's all my fault.
01:08:33.443,01:08:35.612,"Yes, it kind of is."
01:08:35.612,01:08:37.989,And I wanted to help you with your flower shop.
01:08:37.989,01:08:39.616,Instead I've made it worse.
01:08:39.616,01:08:42.035,"Actually, it's completely closed down."
01:08:42.035,01:08:44.079,"Oh, I thought maybe you were remodeling."
01:08:44.079,01:08:48.875,"Nonetheless, I have another idea, and it's greater than all my previous great ideas combined."
01:08:48.875,01:08:50.376,I don't want to hear it!
01:08:50.376,01:08:53.004,Ow. All right.
01:08:53.004,01:08:55.506,"They have the roses, the roses have the pollen."
01:08:55.506,01:08:58.718,"I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park."
01:08:58.718,01:09:02.138,All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.
01:09:02.138,01:09:04.557,Bees. Pollen!
01:09:04.557,01:09:07.351,Repollination!
01:09:07.351,01:09:11.439,"BARRY: All right. Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California."
01:09:11.439,01:09:14.442,"They got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy."
01:09:14.442,01:09:16.027,Security will be tight.
01:09:16.027,01:09:17.570,VANESSA: I have an idea.
01:09:17.570,01:09:19.030,"Vanessa Bloome, FTD."
01:09:19.030,01:09:21.825,Official floral business.
01:09:21.825,01:09:24.077,"Sorry, ma'am. That's a nice brooch, by the way."
01:09:24.077,01:09:26.079,Thank you. It was a gift.
01:09:26.079,01:09:30.750,"BARRY: Then once we're inside, we just pick the right float."
01:09:30.750,01:09:33.003,How about The Princess and the Pea?
01:09:33.003,01:09:37.214,I could be the princess and you could be the pea!
01:09:38.842,01:09:41.385,"Sorry, I'm late. Where should I sit?"
01:09:41.385,01:09:43.304,I believe I'm the pea.
01:09:43.304,01:09:45.056,It's supposed to be under the mattresses.
01:09:45.056,01:09:46.641,"Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart."
01:09:46.641,01:09:48.143,I'm gonna go talk to the marshal.
01:09:48.143,01:09:50.687,You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!
01:09:53.148,01:09:55.232,Let's see what this baby'll do.
01:09:57.027,01:09:58.528,"Hey, what are you doing?"
01:09:58.528,01:10:05.994,BARRY: Then all we do is blend in with traffic without arousing suspicion.
01:10:08.038,01:10:10.915,"And once we're at the airport, there's no stopping us."
01:10:10.915,01:10:13.501,Stop! Security. Did you and your insect pack your own float?
01:10:13.501,01:10:14.752,Yes.
01:10:13.501,01:10:16.838,Has the float been in your possession the entire time?
01:10:16.838,01:10:19.256,Would you remove your shoes and everything in your pockets?
01:10:19.256,01:10:20.633,"Can you remove your stinger, sir?"
01:10:20.633,01:10:22.093,"Uh, that's part of me."
01:10:22.093,01:10:24.846,I know. Just having some fun.
01:10:30.560,01:10:35.899,"BARRY: And then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job."
01:10:35.899,01:10:37.400,Can you believe how lucky we are?
01:10:37.400,01:10:39.777,We have just enough pollen to do the job!
01:10:39.777,01:10:41.529,"I think this is gonna work, Vanessa."
01:10:41.529,01:10:43.114,It's got to work.
01:10:43.114,01:10:45.324,"Passengers, this is Captain Scott."
01:10:45.324,01:10:47.702,I'm afraid we have a bit of bad weather in the New York area.
01:10:47.702,01:10:50.496,We're gonna be experiencing a couple of hours' delay.
01:10:50.496,01:10:53.124,"Barry, these are cut flowers with no water."
01:10:53.124,01:10:54.584,They'll never make it.
01:10:54.584,01:10:56.794,I gotta get up there and talk to these guys.
01:10:56.794,01:10:58.254,Be careful.
01:11:00.048,01:11:03.551,BARRY: Could I get help with this Sky Mall magazine?
01:11:03.551,01:11:07.055,I'd like to order the talking inflatable ear and nose hair trimmer.
01:11:11.434,01:11:13.436,"Excuse me, captain, I'm in a real situation here."
01:11:13.436,01:11:15.063,"What'd you say, Hal?"
01:11:15.063,01:11:17.523,Ah! Bee!
01:11:17.523,01:11:26.449,There's a chance my entire species-- What are you doing?
01:11:29.244,01:11:30.620,Uh-oh.
01:11:30.620,01:11:32.622,BARRY: Wait a minute!
01:11:32.622,01:11:34.832,Who's an attorney?
01:11:39.587,01:11:41.005,"Oh, Barry."
01:11:41.005,01:11:43.299,"Good afternoon, passengers."
01:11:43.299,01:11:44.675,This is your captain speaking.
01:11:44.675,01:11:49.513,"Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome, in 24B, please report to the cockpit?"
01:11:49.513,01:11:51.224,And please hurry!
01:11:52.767,01:11:55.145,Ah! What happened here?
01:11:55.145,01:11:59.149,"I tried to talk to them, but then there was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded."
01:11:59.149,01:12:01.776,"Now one's bald, one's in a boat, and they're both unconscious!"
01:12:01.776,01:12:04.237,Is that another bee joke?
01:12:04.237,01:12:06.114,No one's flying the plane!
01:12:06.114,01:12:09.075,"This is JFK control tower, Flight 356."
01:12:09.075,01:12:10.618,What's your status?
01:12:10.618,01:12:12.203,This is Vanessa Bloome.
01:12:12.203,01:12:13.871,I'm a florist from New York.
01:12:13.871,01:12:15.331,Where's the pilot?
01:12:15.331,01:12:17.667,He's unconscious and so is the co-pilot.
01:12:17.667,01:12:21.045,Not good. Is there anyone on board who has flight experience?
01:12:21.045,01:12:23.298,"As a matter of fact, there is."
01:12:23.298,01:12:24.465,Barry Benson.
01:12:24.465,01:12:26.759,From the honey trial?
01:12:26.759,01:12:29.345,"Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee."
01:12:29.345,01:12:31.555,"It's got giant wings, huge engines."
01:12:31.555,01:12:32.890,I can't fly a plane.
01:12:32.890,01:12:34.642,Why not?
01:12:34.642,01:12:37.270,Yes.
01:12:37.270,01:12:39.314,Wait a minute.
01:12:39.314,01:12:41.149,"Barry, we're headed into some lightning."
01:12:44.235,01:12:46.070,This is Bob Bumble.
01:12:46.070,01:12:51.284,We have some late breaking news from JFK Airport where a very suspenseful scene is developing.
01:12:51.284,01:12:53.995,"Barry Benson, fresh off his stunning legal victory..."
01:12:53.995,01:12:55.371,That's Barry!
01:12:55.371,01:13:00.835,"...is now attempting to land a plane loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew."
01:13:00.835,01:13:02.212,ALL: Flowers?
01:13:02.212,01:13:09.052,We have an electrical storm in the area and two individuals at the controls of a jumbo jet with absolutely no flight experience.
01:13:09.052,01:13:11.637,"Just a minute, Mr. Ditchwater."
01:13:11.637,01:13:16.100,"Oh, I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson's work and his no account compadres."
01:13:16.100,01:13:18.102,Haven't they done enough damage already?
01:13:18.102,01:13:19.770,Isn't he your only hope right now?
01:13:19.770,01:13:22.523,"Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all."
01:13:22.523,01:13:24.859,"The wings are too small, their bodies are too big..."
01:13:24.859,01:13:27.904,"Hey, hold on a second. Haven't we heard this a million times?"
01:13:27.904,01:13:31.115,The surface area of the wings and the body mass doesn't make sense.
01:13:31.115,01:13:32.825,Get this on the air!
01:13:32.825,01:13:35.536,MAN: Stand by.
01:13:35.536,01:13:42.043,BARRY: The way we work may be a mystery to you because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.
01:13:42.043,01:13:44.254,But let me tell you something about a small job.
01:13:44.254,01:13:47.131,"If you do it really well, it makes a big difference."
01:13:47.131,01:13:49.842,More than we realized.
01:13:49.842,01:13:55.723,That's why I want to get bees back to doing what we do best: working together.
01:13:55.723,01:13:58.726,"We're not made of Jell-O, we get behind a fellow."
01:13:58.726,01:14:00.186,Black and yellow!
01:14:00.186,01:14:01.938,ALL: Hello!
01:14:05.233,01:14:07.568,"Left, right, down, hover."
01:14:07.568,01:14:09.153,Forget hover.
01:14:09.153,01:14:11.364,This isn't so hard.
01:14:14.242,01:14:16.035,"Barry, what happened?"
01:14:16.035,01:14:19.038,Wait a minute. I think we were on autopilot that whole time.
01:14:19.038,01:14:20.497,That may have been helping me.
01:14:20.497,01:14:22.208,And now we're not!
01:14:22.208,01:14:25.128,It turns out I cannot fly a plane.
01:14:27.922,01:14:32.427,"All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!"
01:14:32.427,01:14:34.595,Move out!
01:14:42.853,01:14:46.565,Our only chance is if I do what I would do and you copy me with the wings of the plane!
01:14:46.565,01:14:48.734,You don't have to yell.
01:14:48.734,01:14:50.736,We happen to be in a lot of trouble here.
01:14:50.736,01:14:53.906,It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!
01:14:53.906,01:14:56.909,It's not a tone.
01:15:07.711,01:15:09.088,I don't think I can do this!
01:15:09.088,01:15:10.923,Pull yourself together. Listen to me.
01:15:10.923,01:15:12.549,You have got to snap out of it!
01:15:12.549,01:15:14.802,You snap out of it.
01:15:14.802,01:15:17.096,You snap out of it!
01:15:17.096,01:15:18.514,VANESSA: You snap out of it!
01:15:18.514,01:15:20.224,BARRY: You snap out of it!
01:15:39.869,01:15:42.205,You snap out of it.
01:15:42.205,01:15:44.999,Hold it!
01:15:44.999,01:15:47.084,How's the plane flying?
01:15:47.084,01:15:49.462,I don't know.
01:15:49.462,01:15:51.381,Hello?
01:15:49.462,01:15:53.757,"LOU LO DUCA: Hey, Benson, have you got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?"
01:15:53.757,01:15:56.469,The Pollen Jocks!
01:15:56.469,01:15:58.554,Black and yellow.
01:15:58.554,01:16:02.016,"All right, you two, what do you say we drop this tin can on the blacktop?"
01:16:02.016,01:16:04.768,What blacktop? Where? I can't see anything. Can you?
01:16:04.768,01:16:07.021,"No, nothing."
01:16:07.021,01:16:09.690,"Come on, you gotta think bee, Barry."
01:16:09.690,01:16:11.567,Thinking bee.
01:16:11.567,01:16:14.820,ALL: Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
01:16:14.820,01:16:17.532,Wait a minute.
01:16:17.532,01:16:19.033,What?
01:16:17.532,01:16:22.828,"I don't know, but it's strong and it's pulling me like a 27-million-year-old instinct."
01:16:22.828,01:16:24.997,Bring the nose of the plane down.
01:16:26.874,01:16:30.627,Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
01:16:30.627,01:16:32.547,What in the world is on the tarmac?
01:16:32.547,01:16:34.631,Get some lights on that!
01:16:34.631,01:16:38.886,Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
01:16:38.886,01:16:40.096,"Vanessa, aim for the flower."
01:16:40.096,01:16:41.431,Okay.
01:16:41.431,01:16:43.015,Cut the engines.
01:16:43.015,01:16:45.435,We're going in on bee power.
01:16:45.435,01:16:47.353,Affirmative!
01:16:49.688,01:16:53.734,"Good. Good. Easy, now."
01:16:53.734,01:16:55.611,"You ready, boys?"
01:16:55.611,01:16:57.280,LOU LO DUCA: Spin it around!
01:16:59.740,01:17:01.658,"Not that flower, the other!"
01:17:01.658,01:17:03.077,BARRY: That flower.
01:17:03.077,01:17:04.661,VANESSA: I'm aiming at the flower!
01:17:04.661,01:17:06.830,BARRY: That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
01:17:06.830,01:17:11.877,"I mean the giant black and yellow, pulsating flower made of millions of bees!"
01:17:11.877,01:17:15.881,Pull forward. Nose down.
01:17:15.881,01:17:17.800,Rotate around it.
01:17:17.800,01:17:19.594,"This is insane, Barry!"
01:17:19.594,01:17:21.387,This is the only way I know how to fly.
01:17:21.387,01:17:25.349,"Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?"
01:17:25.349,01:17:28.144,BARRY: Get your nose in there.
01:17:28.144,01:17:31.188,"Full reverse! Easy, just drop it. Be a part of it."
01:17:31.188,01:17:33.608,Aim for the center!
01:17:33.608,01:17:37.361,Now drop it in!
01:17:46.829,01:17:48.581,"Come on, already."
01:17:52.793,01:17:55.087,"Barry, we did it!"
01:17:55.087,01:17:57.089,You taught me how to fly!
01:17:57.089,01:17:59.509,Yes. No high-five!
01:17:59.509,01:18:02.595,"Barry, it worked!"
01:18:02.595,01:18:05.431,What giant flower? Where?
01:18:05.431,01:18:07.391,"That was genius, man! Genius!"
01:18:07.391,01:18:09.685,Thank you.
01:18:18.361,01:18:19.778,"Listen, everyone!"
01:18:19.778,01:18:25.618,This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.
01:18:25.618,01:18:27.995,That means this is our last chance.
01:18:27.995,01:18:33.543,"We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this."
01:18:33.543,01:18:36.671,"If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment!"
01:18:36.671,01:18:38.130,"So, what do you all say?"
01:18:38.130,01:18:43.344,"Are we gonna be bees, or just Museum of Natural History keychains?"
01:18:43.344,01:18:45.012,ALL: We're bees!
01:18:45.012,01:18:46.347,Keychain!
01:18:46.347,01:18:48.224,Then follow me!
01:18:48.224,01:18:50.434,Except Keychain.
01:18:50.434,01:18:53.145,"Hold on, Barry."
01:19:00.570,01:19:02.988,ALL: Yeah!
01:19:02.988,01:19:04.490,Yay.
01:19:04.490,01:19:08.494,I'm a Pollen Jock!
01:19:08.494,01:19:11.038,All I gotta do are the sleeves.
01:19:13.916,01:19:15.209,"Oh, yeah."
01:19:15.209,01:19:17.712,That's our Barry.
01:20:27.156,01:20:28.991,Mom! The bees are back!
01:20:42.129,01:20:44.340,"If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time."
01:20:44.340,01:20:47.217,I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!
01:21:00.897,01:21:04.568,VANESSA: Keep the change and have a great afternoon.
01:21:04.568,01:21:06.862,Can I help who's next?
01:21:06.862,01:21:08.405,Would you like some honey?
01:21:08.405,01:21:11.241,It is bee approved.
01:21:11.241,01:21:13.910,"Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me."
01:21:13.910,01:21:16.789,And I don't see a nickel!
01:21:16.789,01:21:19.709,Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!
01:21:19.709,01:21:21.335,I had no idea.
01:21:21.335,01:21:23.713,Barry. I'm sorry.
01:21:23.713,01:21:26.048,Would you excuse me?
01:21:23.713,01:21:28.091,My mosquito associate here will be able to help you.
01:21:28.091,01:21:29.719,"He's a lawyer, too?"
01:21:29.719,01:21:32.638,"Ma'am, I was already a blood-sucking parasite."
01:21:32.638,01:21:34.264,All I needed was a briefcase.
01:21:34.264,01:21:36.225,Have a great afternoon!
01:21:36.225,01:21:38.853,"Barry, I just got this huge tulip order for a wedding."
01:21:38.853,01:21:40.312,And I can't get them anywhere.
01:21:40.312,01:21:42.857,"No problem, Vannie."
01:21:42.857,01:21:44.483,"You're a lifesaver, Barry."
01:21:44.483,01:21:46.193,Can I help who's next?
01:21:46.193,01:21:47.653,"All right, scramble, Jocks!"
01:21:47.653,01:21:48.863,It's time to fly.
01:21:48.863,01:21:50.740,"VANESSA: Thank you, Barry!"
01:21:52.700,01:21:56.912,Oh! That bee is living my life!
01:21:56.912,01:21:59.665,When will this nightmare end?
01:22:05.921,01:22:07.339,Beautiful day to fly.
01:22:07.339,01:22:08.758,Sure is.
01:22:08.758,01:22:12.052,"Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office."
01:29:40.709,01:29:44.129,"ADAM: You have got to start thinking bee, my friend."
01:29:44.129,01:29:45.714,Thinking bee!
01:29:45.714,01:30:23.293,"CHORUS: ADAM: BARRY: BARRY: Hold it, hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it."
01:30:23.293,01:30:25.045,"I'm sorry, everyone."
01:30:25.045,01:30:27.047,Can we stop here?
01:30:27.047,01:30:31.260,"Look, I'm not making a major life decision in the middle of a huge musical production number!"
01:30:31.260,01:30:33.511,"Take ten, everybody."
01:30:33.511,01:30:35.597,I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
