00:01:58.326,00:01:59.745,Manuel.
00:02:00.871,00:02:02.330,Manuel!
00:02:02.330,00:02:04.541,Qu√© contrastes?
00:02:16.386,00:02:18.680,Manuel.
00:03:53.859,00:03:56.070,MAN: I think...
00:03:59.364,00:04:02.034,I think I found you one.
00:04:04.912,00:04:07.330,"Look, I called you, right?"
00:04:09.249,00:04:12.586,Soon as I couldn't pull it out myself...
00:04:13.587,00:04:15.089,"I called you, John."
00:04:28.727,00:04:30.104,"WOMAN: It's okay, it's okay."
00:04:30.104,00:04:31.396,You had to tie her down.
00:04:31.396,00:04:33.023,It'll be okay.
00:04:33.481,00:04:34.691,It's okay.
00:05:27.995,00:05:30.956,This is Constantine.
00:05:30.956,00:05:34.042,John Constantine...
00:05:34.042,00:05:35.252,asshole.
00:05:43.551,00:05:44.886,Sure.
00:06:07.951,00:06:09.911,What the hell?
00:06:27.346,00:06:28.930,I need a mirror.
00:06:28.930,00:06:32.059,Now! At least 3 feet high.
00:06:32.059,00:06:34.435,Move!
00:06:48.783,00:06:50.869,This is Kramer.
00:06:50.869,00:06:53.705,"Chas Kramer, asshole."
00:06:54.622,00:06:56.208,Asshole.
00:06:56.208,00:06:57.376,What?
00:06:57.376,00:06:59.669,Oh. This is Kramer.
00:06:59.669,00:07:01.629,"Chas Kramer, asshole."
00:07:01.629,00:07:03.090,CONSTANTINE: Chas!
00:07:03.090,00:07:04.132,What?
00:07:04.132,00:07:05.424,Move the car.
00:07:05.424,00:07:06.843,Why?
00:07:06.843,00:07:08.929,Move the damn car!
00:07:12.807,00:07:14.309,"Chas, move the car."
00:07:16.561,00:07:17.771,"There, car's moved."
00:07:28.740,00:07:30.700,Lift it up over the bed.
00:07:33.120,00:07:34.121,Tie that end off.
00:07:34.121,00:07:35.663,Hennessy...
00:07:35.663,00:07:37.082,over the top.
00:07:38.250,00:07:39.667,Close your eyes.
00:07:39.667,00:07:42.087,And whatever happens...
00:07:42.087,00:07:43.671,don't look.
00:07:55.600,00:07:56.810,No!
00:08:04.025,00:08:05.693,Show yourself.
00:08:09.990,00:08:12.367,"Smile pretty, you vain prick."
00:08:16.913,00:08:18.706,Ah.
00:08:20.708,00:08:21.960,For your boss.
00:08:23.211,00:08:24.504,Pull it!
00:08:27.466,00:08:53.616,Shi-- Ma? Ma?
00:08:53.616,00:08:55.369,MOTHER: Ohhh...
00:09:28.985,00:09:32.613,"HENNESSY: Like I said, I found you something, didn't I, John?"
00:09:32.613,00:09:33.990,Didn't I?
00:09:33.990,00:09:35.909,What happened in there?
00:09:43.291,00:09:45.544,"Going to a lot of meetings, I see."
00:09:45.544,00:09:47.921,Keeps the voices out so I can sleep.
00:09:49.172,00:09:51.049,"I have to sleep, John."
00:09:51.799,00:09:54.135,"I need some help, Father."
00:09:54.135,00:09:55.887,You do?
00:09:57.264,00:09:58.973,From me?
00:09:58.973,00:10:00.767,What kind of--?
00:10:02.685,00:10:03.686,Hey.
00:10:03.686,00:10:07.107,"Listen, I-- That exorcism wasn't right."
00:10:10.277,00:10:12.028,Listen to the ether.
00:10:12.987,00:10:14.739,Anything unusual...
00:10:15.365,00:10:17.117,you let me know.
00:10:17.117,00:10:19.119,"Come on, you don't need its protection."
00:10:19.119,00:10:21.288,It'll be like back in the day.
00:10:25.333,00:10:27.001,A few days.
00:10:27.627,00:10:29.087,Okay.
00:10:29.087,00:10:30.797,Okay.
00:10:30.797,00:10:32.632,"For you, John."
00:10:35.552,00:10:38.972,"John, why would you do that if you know it's not my car?"
00:10:38.972,00:10:40.390,I told you to move it.
00:10:40.390,00:10:42.392,"All right, John, you did tell me to move it."
00:10:42.392,00:10:48.064,"But if you would've told me that it was a 300-pound mirror you were dropping with a pissed-off demon, I would've moved it further, John."
00:10:48.064,00:10:49.316,Take Alvarado.
00:10:49.316,00:10:51.526,"Yeah, John, thank you."
00:10:52.902,00:10:57.031,"CHAS: You ever think if you told me more now, that maybe I could help out?"
00:10:57.031,00:10:58.241,Huh?
00:10:58.241,00:11:01.661,Nope? Of course it's a nope.
00:11:38.948,00:11:40.867,"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."
00:11:44.162,00:11:45.455,It's been...
00:11:46.998,00:11:50.335,two weeks since my last confession.
00:11:53.380,00:11:55.882,I killed a man today.
00:11:56.757,00:11:58.677,Another one.
00:12:03.056,00:12:04.516,I didn't even...
00:12:05.559,00:12:06.560,see his face.
00:12:06.560,00:12:07.810,I just...
00:12:08.769,00:12:11.314,"pulled the trigger, and he went away."
00:12:12.524,00:12:14.984,Most cops go 20 years...
00:12:16.110,00:12:18.779,without firing their guns.
00:12:19.864,00:12:24.035,Why do I always know where these guys are?
00:12:24.035,00:12:27.288,"Where to aim, when to fire."
00:12:28.498,00:12:32.252,"I wonder, is there something wrong with me, Father?"
00:12:33.211,00:12:35.088,Something damned?
00:12:35.088,00:12:39.217,PRIEST: God has a plan for you.
00:12:40.552,00:12:45.098,You mustn't let your faith be overshadowed by guilt.
00:12:45.098,00:12:48.059,"WOMAN: Yeah, I'm trying."
00:12:48.059,00:12:50.604,I'm trying real hard.
00:12:52.480,00:12:54.107,Isabel.
00:13:44.282,00:13:46.367,Isabel.
00:14:43.132,00:14:46.511,CONSTANTINE: Things I've beaten.
00:14:46.511,00:14:49.639,Things most people never even heard of.
00:14:49.639,00:14:52.308,And now I'm gonna be done in by this.
00:14:54.101,00:14:56.229,"Wouldn't be the first, John."
00:14:58.314,00:14:59.399,"Come on, Les..."
00:15:00.525,00:15:03.069,"you saved me before, you can do it again, right?"
00:15:03.069,00:15:05.613,This is aggressive.
00:15:07.240,00:15:10.993,Twenty years ago you didn't wanna be here.
00:15:10.993,00:15:13.996,Now you don't wanna leave.
00:15:13.996,00:15:16.374,"Yeah, that's a good idea."
00:15:19.085,00:15:21.212,"John, you really need to prepare."
00:15:25.049,00:15:26.676,Make arrangements.
00:15:26.676,00:15:28.887,No need.
00:15:28.887,00:15:32.223,I already know exactly where I'm going.
00:15:36.102,00:15:37.353,Morning.
00:15:38.646,00:15:40.314,Good morning.
00:15:41.232,00:15:43.276,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:15:43.276,00:15:45.445,"You don't need to see this, okay? No."
00:15:47.113,00:15:48.823,"Give us the room, please."
00:16:19.854,00:16:21.397,Isabel.
00:16:28.655,00:16:31.115,She fell from the roof.
00:16:31.115,00:16:33.117,MAN: She jumped.
00:16:35.119,00:16:36.871,No.
00:16:35.119,00:16:41.167,"Look, I know it's hard to accept, she was sick."
00:16:49.467,00:16:51.886,Isabel wouldn't kill herself.
00:16:51.886,00:16:53.053,Angie...
00:16:53.888,00:16:55.431,She wouldn't kill herself.
00:16:55.431,00:16:56.349,Detective.
00:16:56.349,00:16:57.475,Period.
00:16:57.475,00:16:58.601,Period!
00:16:59.894,00:17:03.147,"Angie, there were security cameras."
00:17:13.282,00:17:15.159,Hold the door!
00:17:15.159,00:17:16.828,Not if I can help it.
00:18:07.378,00:18:09.047,A new case?
00:18:09.047,00:18:11.758,The big score?
00:18:11.758,00:18:14.969,The one you've been waiting for?
00:18:14.969,00:18:16.596,Humor me.
00:18:16.596,00:18:18.264,Don't I always?
00:18:23.811,00:18:24.812,Much obliged.
00:18:24.812,00:18:26.313,Thank you.
00:18:28.649,00:18:30.484,"How you feeling, John?"
00:18:30.484,00:18:32.445,"So, what's new?"
00:18:33.905,00:18:34.948,Uh...
00:18:36.323,00:18:44.082,"Bullet shavings from the assassination attempt on the pope, Holy water ampoules from the River Jordan."
00:18:44.082,00:18:46.626,"And, oh, you'll love this."
00:18:46.626,00:18:48.920,A screech beetle from Amityville.
00:18:51.005,00:18:52.256,Here.
00:18:52.256,00:18:55.509,"It's funny to you, but to the fallen, that's like nails on a chalkboard."
00:18:55.509,00:18:57.762,What is it exactly with you and bugs?
00:18:59.472,00:19:01.933,I just like them.
00:19:01.933,00:19:04.018,"Yeah, who doesn't?"
00:19:05.853,00:19:08.064,"Yeah, easy there, hero."
00:19:08.064,00:19:10.024,That's dragon's breath.
00:19:10.024,00:19:11.859,I thought you couldn't get it anymore.
00:19:11.859,00:19:13.653,"Yeah, well, I..."
00:19:14.737,00:19:16.614,I know a guy who knows a guy.
00:19:22.912,00:19:24.163,"So, uh..."
00:19:24.163,00:19:25.665,what's the action?
00:19:27.000,00:19:29.836,I just pulled a soldier demon out of a little girl.
00:19:31.170,00:19:33.631,Looked like it was trying to come through.
00:19:35.883,00:19:37.135,"Yeah, I know how it sounds."
00:19:37.135,00:19:39.637,"No, we're finger puppets to them, John."
00:19:39.637,00:19:41.180,Not doorways.
00:19:41.180,00:19:45.601,"They can work us, but they can't come through onto our plane."
00:19:45.601,00:19:48.187,Check the scrolls anyway.
00:19:48.187,00:19:50.023,"Sure thing, John."
00:19:50.023,00:19:51.231,Uh...
00:19:51.231,00:19:53.067,Anything else?
00:19:53.067,00:19:55.528,"Wouldn't happen to have anything for a, uh...?"
00:19:57.864,00:19:59.198,On the house.
00:20:00.240,00:20:01.826,"CHAS: All right, question."
00:20:01.826,00:20:03.911,"How much longer do I have to be your slave, John?"
00:20:05.538,00:20:07.456,"You're not my slave, Chas."
00:20:08.582,00:20:11.836,You're my very appreciated apprentice.
00:20:11.836,00:20:14.338,Like Tonto or Robin.
00:20:14.338,00:20:17.800,Or that skinny fellow with the fat friend.
00:20:17.800,00:20:21.179,"Right. So then why don't I apprentice something besides driving then, John?"
00:20:23.806,00:20:25.641,John? John!
00:20:26.642,00:20:29.103,"I love our little talks, John!"
00:20:42.742,00:20:44.202,"May I take your coat, Mr. Constantine?"
00:20:44.202,00:20:47.914,"No, thanks."
00:20:47.914,00:20:49.123,"How about you, ma'am?"
00:20:49.123,00:20:51.959,"Oh, no, I'm not staying long, either."
00:20:51.959,00:20:53.002,Um...
00:20:53.002,00:20:54.420,I really need to speak with him.
00:20:54.420,00:20:55.379,It's very important.
00:20:55.379,00:20:58.257,"First come, first served."
00:21:00.176,00:21:01.385,Oh.
00:21:01.385,00:21:04.430,So you're rude no matter where you are.
00:21:13.022,00:21:14.481,Father.
00:21:15.775,00:21:16.943,You have news.
00:21:16.943,00:21:19.445,"Yes, I spoke with the bishop."
00:21:25.284,00:21:28.079,"I know what you want, son."
00:21:28.079,00:21:31.791,"CONSTANTINE: Still keeping your all-seeing eye on me, Gabriel?"
00:21:33.126,00:21:34.794,I'm flattered.
00:21:36.420,00:21:43.302,"Well, I could offer something about how a shepherd leads even the most wayward of his flock."
00:21:43.302,00:21:45.387,But it might sound disingenuous.
00:21:45.387,00:21:47.807,"She has to have a Catholic funeral, Father."
00:21:47.807,00:21:49.100,She has to.
00:21:49.100,00:21:51.518,"Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin."
00:21:51.518,00:21:52.812,She didn't commit suicide.
00:21:52.812,00:21:54.313,The bishop believes otherwise.
00:21:54.313,00:21:55.606,"You know the rules, Angela."
00:21:55.606,00:21:57.817,"Oh, rules!"
00:21:57.817,00:21:59.110,Father...
00:22:00.153,00:22:01.570,David...
00:22:02.822,00:22:05.074,this is Isabel.
00:22:05.074,00:22:09.912,God was the only one she ever believed loved her.
00:22:09.912,00:22:11.497,Please?
00:22:12.414,00:22:14.292,I'm sorry.
00:22:16.919,00:22:20.589,I've been seeing some unusual soul traffic lately.
00:22:20.589,00:22:23.467,You might consider giving me an extension.
00:22:23.467,00:22:26.262,I could do your side some good these days.
00:22:26.262,00:22:28.555,You still trying to buy your way into heaven?
00:22:29.556,00:22:32.601,What about the minions I've sent back?
00:22:32.601,00:22:35.229,That alone should guarantee my entry.
00:22:35.229,00:22:37.023,How many times have I told you?
00:22:37.023,00:22:39.108,That's not the way this works.
00:22:39.108,00:22:41.277,Why?
00:22:42.862,00:22:44.113,What does He want from me?
00:22:44.113,00:22:45.990,Only the usual.
00:22:45.990,00:22:49.118,"Self-sacrifice, belief."
00:22:49.118,00:22:51.162,"Oh, I believe, for Christ's sake!"
00:22:51.162,00:22:54.040,"No, no, you know."
00:22:54.040,00:22:54.999,You've seen.
00:22:54.999,00:22:56.834,I never asked to see.
00:22:56.834,00:22:59.879,I was born with this curse.
00:22:59.879,00:23:02.089,"A gift, John."
00:23:02.089,00:23:04.717,One that you've squandered on selfish endeavors.
00:23:04.717,00:23:07.261,I'm pulling demons out of little girls.
00:23:07.261,00:23:09.680,Who's that for?
00:23:11.182,00:23:14.018,Everything you've ever done you've only ever done for yourself.
00:23:15.102,00:23:17.604,To earn your way back into his good graces.
00:23:17.604,00:23:20.398,"Impossible rules, endless regulations."
00:23:20.398,00:23:22.484,Who goes up?
00:23:22.484,00:23:24.028,And why?
00:23:28.782,00:23:30.576,You don't even understand us.
00:23:32.286,00:23:35.206,"You're the one who should go to hell, half-breed."
00:23:47.676,00:23:49.803,"Why me, Gabriel?"
00:23:51.055,00:23:54.058,"It's personal, isn't it?"
00:23:54.058,00:23:55.642,I didn't...
00:23:55.642,00:23:56.810,go to church enough.
00:23:56.810,00:23:58.271,I didn't pray enough.
00:23:58.271,00:23:59.397,I...
00:23:59.939,00:24:02.440,was 5 bucks short in the collection plate.
00:24:02.440,00:24:04.026,Why?
00:24:05.903,00:24:08.322,You are going to die young because...
00:24:09.156,00:24:11.700,you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15.
00:24:13.327,00:24:15.329,And you're going to go to hell...
00:24:16.205,00:24:18.456,because of the life you took.
00:24:24.130,00:24:26.006,You're fucked.
00:24:37.559,00:24:39.477,At least it's nice out.
00:24:42.564,00:24:46.068,He always had a rotten sense of humor.
00:24:51.949,00:24:55.286,And his punch lines are killers.
00:25:01.292,00:25:03.002,CHAS: John!
00:25:03.002,00:25:05.045,"Constantine, it's raining! John!"
00:25:05.045,00:25:06.672,Hey!
00:25:19.643,00:25:23.397,"MALE VOICE: Twenty-two women from Louisville, Kentucky were found buried in the assailant's back yard."
00:25:23.397,00:25:27.234,"So much damage had been done to the bodies, police had to match..."
00:25:27.234,00:25:32.698,FEMALE VOICE: Police report she had been physically penetrated over 100 times and buried alive.
00:25:32.698,00:25:36.285,"MALE VOICE: ...found locked in a storage freezer, his head severed and his organs...."
00:25:36.285,00:25:38.578,FEMALE VOICE: He stuffed Holly's body into....
00:25:38.578,00:25:40.706,MALE VOICE: ...the bodies ravished by the unknown....
00:25:40.706,00:25:43.334,FEMALE VOICE: He used a small handsaw from the toolbox...
00:25:43.334,00:25:46.462,MALE VOICE: ...and nearly decapitated.
00:25:46.462,00:25:48.422,Isabel.
00:26:12.071,00:26:14.240,"I'm so sorry, Izzy."
00:26:15.032,00:26:16.742,Constantine.
00:26:50.734,00:26:51.944,Dodson.
00:26:52.861,00:26:54.113,Hello?
00:26:55.489,00:26:57.074,Hello?
00:27:02.871,00:27:03.914,Hello?
00:28:06.644,00:28:07.853,MAN: Hey.
00:28:07.853,00:28:09.605,"Hey, buddy, got a light?"
00:28:40.844,00:28:44.223,"Should've minded your own business, exorcist!"
00:29:06.870,00:29:09.623,"CHAS: I know where you're going, John."
00:29:09.623,00:29:11.250,You're going to Midnite's.
00:29:11.250,00:29:13.126,Aren't you supposed to be waiting in the cab.
00:29:13.126,00:29:15.421,It's a haven for those who rise and fall.
00:29:15.421,00:29:17.005,"I remember reading about this, John."
00:29:17.005,00:29:18.840,"You read too much, kid."
00:29:18.840,00:29:20.509,It's a bar?
00:29:20.509,00:29:22.761,Papa Midnite is a crusader for good.
00:29:22.761,00:29:24.304,He swore the oath of neutrality.
00:29:24.304,00:29:25.598,"John, the man's a legend."
00:29:25.598,00:29:27.349,Yeah.
00:29:27.349,00:29:29.351,"Can you please get me into this bar, John, please?"
00:29:29.351,00:29:31.687,"I'm begging you, John, please? Please?"
00:29:31.687,00:29:33.439,"Sure, you can get in."
00:29:33.439,00:29:35.148,I can get in?
00:29:35.148,00:29:37.192,If you can get in.
00:29:37.192,00:29:38.485,Wha-- If I can get--?
00:29:38.485,00:29:40.070,"It's a bear, though, right?"
00:29:40.070,00:29:41.988,Or two ducks in a cloud?
00:29:45.825,00:29:47.453,Two frogs on a bench.
00:29:52.082,00:29:53.959,Two frogs on a bench.
00:29:53.959,00:29:56.086,"No, no, no."
00:29:53.959,00:29:57.755,I'm with the guy you just-- John! John!
00:29:57.755,00:29:59.423,"I'm with him, though."
00:30:01.300,00:30:02.635,Rat in a dress.
00:30:04.010,00:30:06.888,Of course it is.
00:30:06.888,00:30:08.932,I'm just testing.
00:31:03.236,00:31:05.071,CONSTANTINE: Don't get up.
00:31:06.031,00:31:08.908,MAN: You've been absent some time.
00:31:08.908,00:31:12.329,Have you come here with relics to sell?
00:31:12.329,00:31:13.747,"No, I'm out of that now."
00:31:13.747,00:31:15.624,I've been too busy.
00:31:15.624,00:31:19.878,Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up being bad for your health.
00:31:19.878,00:31:21.755,"Midnite, Jesus..."
00:31:21.755,00:31:25.425,I thought the thing was authentic.
00:31:26.802,00:31:28.136,Oh.
00:31:28.136,00:31:29.971,I see now.
00:31:29.971,00:31:32.307,Your health is bad for other reasons.
00:31:32.307,00:31:33.559,How long?
00:31:33.559,00:31:35.352,"A few months, maybe a year."
00:31:35.352,00:31:38.355,I thought I heard thunder last night.
00:31:38.355,00:31:40.566,Must have been Satan's stomach growling.
00:31:42.860,00:31:45.945,You're the one soul he'd come up here himself to collect.
00:31:45.945,00:31:47.947,So I've heard.
00:31:47.947,00:31:50.200,Well...
00:31:50.200,00:31:55.247,I am most certain you did not come here for a sympathetic shoulder to cry on.
00:31:57.583,00:32:01.169,"A demon just attacked me, right out in the open on Figueroa."
00:32:01.169,00:32:03.714,"They don't like you, John."
00:32:03.714,00:32:05.632,How many have you deported back to hell?
00:32:05.632,00:32:07.050,"Not some angry half-breed, Midnite."
00:32:07.050,00:32:11.054,"A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane."
00:32:11.054,00:32:13.640,Clearly I do not have to remind you that is impossible.
00:32:13.640,00:32:18.103,And yesterday I saw a soldier demon trying to chew its way out through a little girl.
00:32:18.103,00:32:19.605,"Listen, John."
00:32:19.605,00:32:22.900,"Demons stay in hell, angels in heaven..."
00:32:22.900,00:32:26.111,the great d√©tente of the original superpowers.
00:32:26.111,00:32:28.530,"Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite."
00:32:28.530,00:32:31.324,You've been a tremendous help.
00:32:31.324,00:32:32.951,Now...
00:32:34.453,00:32:36.705,I need to use the chair.
00:32:39.625,00:32:46.298,"John, forgetting the fact that it would almost certainly kill you, you know I am neutral."
00:32:46.298,00:32:49.927,"And as long as the balance is maintained, I take no sides."
00:32:51.136,00:32:53.722,Before you were a bartender...
00:32:55.140,00:32:58.852,"you were one witch doctor against, what, 30 Ashgar?"
00:32:58.852,00:33:02.856,And I-- You were Constantine.
00:33:02.856,00:33:06.526,The John Constantine.
00:33:06.526,00:33:08.654,Once.
00:33:10.113,00:33:13.784,"This isn't the usual game, I can feel it."
00:33:13.784,00:33:15.744,Something's coming.
00:33:15.744,00:33:18.037,"MAN: Oh, Spooky."
00:33:19.205,00:33:21.082,Balthazar.
00:33:21.082,00:33:23.376,That expression alone has...
00:33:24.085,00:33:25.378,made my entire night.
00:33:25.378,00:33:27.506,I'll make your night.
00:33:27.506,00:33:31.468,"I'll deport your sorry ass right where you stand, you half-breed shit!"
00:33:32.678,00:33:35.305,You know the rules of my house.
00:33:35.305,00:33:37.850,"While here, you will abide by them."
00:33:37.850,00:33:39.434,BALTHAZAR: Johnny boy.
00:33:41.353,00:33:42.395,Mm.
00:33:42.395,00:33:43.730,Word is...
00:33:44.564,00:33:46.733,you're on your way down.
00:33:46.733,00:33:48.652,Fresh meat.
00:33:52.405,00:33:54.992,Finger-licking good.
00:33:54.992,00:33:56.869,"We have a meeting now, John."
00:34:04.710,00:34:07.128,What? I didn't catch that.
00:34:12.718,00:34:14.344,MAN: Hey!
00:34:14.344,00:34:15.554,WOMAN: Come on!
00:34:50.463,00:34:53.008,Welcome to my life.
00:35:02.475,00:35:03.894,Mr. Constantine.
00:35:05.938,00:35:07.522,I saw you-- I remember.
00:35:08.690,00:35:10.776,And then I saw you at the-- Regular kismet.
00:35:13.111,00:35:16.615,"I'd like to ask you a few questions, if that would be okay."
00:35:16.615,00:35:19.117,I'm not really in the talking mood right now.
00:35:20.285,00:35:22.746,"Well, maybe you could just listen then."
00:35:22.746,00:35:24.330,Please?
00:35:29.044,00:35:30.921,CONSTANTINE: Always a catch.
00:35:45.560,00:35:48.396,My sister was murdered yesterday.
00:35:48.396,00:35:50.732,Sorry to hear.
00:35:51.733,00:35:53.777,She was a patient at Ravenscar.
00:35:53.777,00:35:54.820,She...
00:35:54.820,00:35:56.488,jumped off the roof.
00:35:57.363,00:35:59.407,Thought you said she was murdered.
00:35:59.407,00:36:02.661,"Yeah, well, Isabel wouldn't have taken her own life."
00:36:02.661,00:36:07.206,"Yeah, what kind of mental patient kills herself?"
00:36:07.206,00:36:09.042,That's just crazy.
00:36:13.254,00:36:16.424,"Look, I've heard your name around the precinct."
00:36:17.342,00:36:18.760,I know the circles you travel in.
00:36:18.760,00:36:22.722,"The occult, demonology, exorcisms."
00:36:22.722,00:36:26.559,"Just before my sister was committed, she became deeply paranoid."
00:36:26.559,00:36:29.896,She started talking about demons...
00:36:29.896,00:36:31.481,angels.
00:36:31.481,00:36:35.234,"Now, I think someone got to her, Mr. Constantine."
00:36:35.234,00:36:38.321,I think they brainwashed her into stepping off that roof.
00:36:38.321,00:36:41.783,"Some kind of legion or, um, a cult."
00:36:42.617,00:36:46.163,"Sounds like a theory, detective."
00:36:46.163,00:36:47.747,Good luck.
00:36:49.499,00:36:55.047,"Well, I thought that with your background, you could at least point me in the right direction."
00:36:55.047,00:36:56.422,"Yeah, okay. Sure."
00:37:00.052,00:37:02.220,It wasn't a suicide.
00:37:02.220,00:37:04.347,My sister was a devout Catholic.
00:37:04.347,00:37:05.974,Do you understand what that means?
00:37:05.974,00:37:10.228,"That means if she'd taken her own life, her soul-- Her soul would go straight to hell..."
00:37:10.228,00:37:17.360,"where she'd be ripped apart over and over in screaming, brutal agony for all eternity."
00:37:17.360,00:37:19.029,That it?
00:37:19.029,00:37:20.739,That about right?
00:37:28.038,00:37:29.372,Goddamn you.
00:37:54.731,00:37:55.941,Ah!
00:37:55.941,00:37:57.943,Go around.
00:38:00.445,00:38:01.988,Detective.
00:38:01.988,00:38:05.200,What if I told you that God and the devil made a wager...
00:38:05.200,00:38:08.661,a kind of standing bet for the souls of all mankind?
00:38:08.661,00:38:11.164,I'd tell you to stay on your meds.
00:38:11.164,00:38:12.665,Humor me.
00:38:12.665,00:38:15.710,No direct contact with humans.
00:38:15.710,00:38:18.046,Just influence.
00:38:18.046,00:38:20.339,"Okay, I'm humoring you."
00:38:20.339,00:38:22.550,Why?
00:38:22.550,00:38:24.469,Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling.
00:38:24.469,00:38:25.929,"Oh, so it's fun?"
00:38:25.929,00:38:27.889,It's fun when a man beats his wife to death.
00:38:27.889,00:38:30.976,It's fun when a mother drowns her own baby.
00:38:30.976,00:38:34.146,And you think the devil is responsible?
00:38:34.146,00:38:36.522,"People are evil, Mr. Constantine."
00:38:36.522,00:38:37.899,People.
00:38:37.899,00:38:39.067,You're right.
00:38:39.067,00:38:41.527,We're born capable of terrible things.
00:38:41.527,00:38:45.406,But then sometimes something else comes along and gives us just the right nudge.
00:38:45.406,00:38:48.160,"Well, this has been real educational but..."
00:38:49.410,00:38:50.996,I don't believe in the devil.
00:38:50.996,00:38:52.164,You should.
00:38:52.164,00:38:54.749,He believes in you.
00:39:14.602,00:39:15.812,It's a power outage.
00:39:16.855,00:39:17.981,Not likely.
00:39:20.859,00:39:21.985,What?
00:39:21.985,00:39:24.696,We should go. Now.
00:39:30.160,00:39:31.244,What is that?
00:39:32.704,00:39:35.207,Wings.
00:39:35.207,00:39:37.292,Maybe talons.
00:39:38.126,00:39:39.836,You're kidding.
00:39:39.836,00:39:41.087,Of what?
00:39:41.087,00:39:43.882,Something that's not supposed to be here.
00:39:48.845,00:39:50.513,That's really not going to help.
00:39:56.061,00:39:57.478,Close your eyes.
00:39:57.478,00:39:59.022,Why?
00:39:59.022,00:40:00.481,Suit yourself.
00:40:22.670,00:40:26.007,"Demons stay in hell, huh?"
00:40:27.217,00:40:28.927,Tell them that.
00:40:31.429,00:40:33.056,Don't worry.
00:40:33.056,00:40:35.558,Happens to everyone the first time.
00:40:36.517,00:40:39.145,It's the sulfur.
00:40:39.145,00:40:41.314,Sulfur?
00:40:43.358,00:40:45.944,What were those things?
00:40:47.112,00:40:48.529,Demons.
00:40:50.656,00:40:52.450,Scavengers of the damned.
00:40:52.450,00:40:53.576,"No, no."
00:40:53.576,00:40:55.287,It's impossible.
00:40:55.287,00:40:56.537,Yeah.
00:40:56.537,00:40:59.207,And I don't think they were after me.
00:41:01.167,00:41:04.379,You really believe she wouldn't commit suicide?
00:41:04.379,00:41:05.964,Isabel?
00:41:05.964,00:41:08.841,Never in a million years.
00:41:08.841,00:41:11.344,"Well, let's be sure."
00:41:11.344,00:41:13.805,Let's see if she's in hell.
00:41:38.204,00:41:40.581,"ANGELA: Oh, was it supposed to be hot or cold?"
00:41:40.581,00:41:42.459,In front of the chair.
00:41:46.004,00:41:47.922,I can't believe I'm doing this.
00:41:47.922,00:41:49.674,These are all of Isabel's things?
00:41:49.674,00:41:50.842,Yeah.
00:41:51.759,00:41:54.012,How about the cat?
00:41:54.512,00:41:55.888,"Yeah, why?"
00:41:57.556,00:41:59.017,Duck?
00:41:59.017,00:42:01.519,"Oh, you think that's strange."
00:42:01.519,00:42:03.062,Cats are good.
00:42:03.062,00:42:04.939,"Half in, half out anyway."
00:42:22.999,00:42:29.797,"If this is some kind of spell or something, don't you need candles and a pentagram for it to work?"
00:42:29.797,00:42:31.383,"Why, do you have any?"
00:42:32.467,00:42:33.676,This is crazy.
00:42:33.676,00:42:35.387,Yes.
00:42:38.890,00:42:41.059,I need you to leave.
00:42:42.060,00:42:43.102,I'm sorry?
00:42:43.102,00:42:44.896,"Angela, please."
00:42:46.439,00:42:48.233,Okay.
00:42:49.234,00:42:50.776,The apartment.
00:42:53.238,00:42:54.572,Okay.
00:43:01.454,00:43:03.206,Be careful with that cat.
00:43:08.127,00:43:09.712,"God, I hate this part."
00:45:13.670,00:45:14.920,Isabel.
00:45:14.920,00:45:16.713,Constantine.
00:46:01.926,00:46:03.636,CONSTANTINE: Angela.
00:46:06.889,00:46:08.641,Jesus.
00:46:12.645,00:46:13.646,"Constantine, what--?"
00:46:13.646,00:46:14.647,Twins.
00:46:14.647,00:46:16.608,Jesus. What?
00:46:16.608,00:46:18.317,You were twins.
00:46:18.317,00:46:19.985,What did you say?
00:46:19.985,00:46:22.863,She killed herself.
00:46:23.864,00:46:26.576,And she's damned for it.
00:46:39.422,00:46:41.424,How is this possible?
00:46:43.760,00:46:45.844,I need to eat.
00:48:33.369,00:48:36.080,"Hey! Hey, what are you doin' in here?"
00:48:38.875,00:48:41.252,"Relax, man."
00:48:41.252,00:48:43.421,Slow down!
00:49:06.360,00:49:08.738,What the hell kind of place is this?
00:49:59.872,00:50:01.165,John.
00:50:32.028,00:50:36.408,"CONSTANTINE: When I was a kid, I could see things."
00:50:36.408,00:50:38.870,Things humans aren't supposed to see.
00:50:39.954,00:50:41.706,Things you shouldn't have to see.
00:51:00.558,00:51:02.309,My parents were normal.
00:51:02.309,00:51:05.021,They did what most parents would do.
00:51:05.021,00:51:06.981,They made it worse.
00:51:09.984,00:51:14.655,"You think you're crazy long enough, you find a way out."
00:51:14.655,00:51:16.699,ANGELA: You tried to kill yourself.
00:51:16.699,00:51:19.075,CONSTANTINE: I didn't try anything.
00:51:22.329,00:51:25.958,"Officially, I was dead for two minutes."
00:51:26.625,00:51:28.377,But when you cross over...
00:51:30.212,00:51:32.673,time stops.
00:51:33.883,00:51:37.135,"Take it from me, two minutes in hell is a lifetime."
00:51:38.763,00:51:40.598,When I came back...
00:51:42.975,00:51:44.142,I knew...
00:51:45.061,00:51:48.104,all the things I could see were real.
00:51:49.065,00:51:51.567,Heaven and hell are right here.
00:51:51.567,00:51:54.486,"Behind every wall, every window."
00:51:54.486,00:51:59.700,"The world behind the world, and we're smack in the middle."
00:51:59.700,00:52:03.287,Angels and demons can't cross over onto our plane.
00:52:03.287,00:52:06.331,So instead we get what I call half-breeds.
00:52:07.416,00:52:09.710,The influence peddlers.
00:52:09.710,00:52:19.678,"They can only whisper in our ears, but a single word can give you courage, or turn your favorite pleasure into your worst nightmare."
00:52:19.678,00:52:21.722,Those with the demon's touch...
00:52:22.848,00:52:28.144,"like those part angel, living alongside us."
00:52:28.144,00:52:31.065,They call it the balance.
00:52:31.065,00:52:34.318,I call it hypocritical bullshit.
00:52:35.611,00:52:42.868,"So when a half-breed breaks the rules, I deport their sorry ass straight back to hell."
00:52:42.868,00:52:45.955,"I don't get them all, but..."
00:52:47.123,00:52:49.667,I've been hoping to get enough to ensure my...
00:52:51.502,00:52:53.045,retirement.
00:52:53.045,00:52:54.797,I don't understand.
00:52:56.465,00:52:58.759,"I'm a suicide, Angela."
00:52:58.759,00:53:02.429,"When I die, the rules say I've got just one place to go."
00:53:02.429,00:53:04.640,You're trying to buy your way into heaven.
00:53:04.640,00:53:10.062,What would you do if you were sentenced to a prison where half the inmates were put there by you?
00:53:12.148,00:53:14.817,I guess God has a plan for all of us.
00:53:14.817,00:53:18.403,"God's a kid with an ant farm, lady."
00:53:18.403,00:53:20.656,He's not planning anything.
00:53:20.656,00:53:22.240,When we were little...
00:53:23.868,00:53:25.619,Isabel saw things too.
00:53:31.834,00:53:33.460,Dodson.
00:53:35.754,00:53:38.757,"WEISS: Guard spotted him groping the body, then he ran across the street."
00:53:38.757,00:53:42.761,"Came in here, and he had a go at the entire stock."
00:53:42.761,00:53:46.598,He drowned himself in alcohol in under a minute.
00:53:46.598,00:53:49.393,Could've been a member of my fraternity.
00:53:51.687,00:53:53.814,"Hey, what the hell is he doing here?"
00:53:53.814,00:53:55.733,He's okay.
00:54:04.867,00:54:07.912,"Why didn't you call me, you son of a bitch?"
00:54:43.405,00:54:45.116,BEEMAN: Yes?
00:54:46.033,00:54:48.619,What do you mean?
00:54:48.619,00:54:50.286,What?
00:54:50.286,00:54:51.997,How?
00:55:00.296,00:55:01.840,Mm-hmm.
00:55:03.299,00:55:04.426,Got it.
00:55:05.136,00:55:06.470,Bye.
00:55:13.018,00:55:15.980,I need to see where Isabel died.
00:55:15.980,00:55:19.441,"ANGELA: S√©ances, Ouija boards, channeling."
00:55:19.441,00:55:23.862,Our father thought she was just trying to get attention.
00:55:23.862,00:55:26.364,She certainly did that.
00:55:26.364,00:55:30.077,She'd tell everyone about the things she said she saw.
00:55:30.077,00:55:33.998,She'd scare my mother half to death.
00:55:35.624,00:55:38.543,And then she stopped talking for almost a year.
00:55:38.543,00:55:40.921,So you had her committed.
00:55:40.921,00:55:42.422,Yeah.
00:55:42.422,00:55:44.216,How long?
00:55:44.216,00:55:46.677,Two weeks.
00:55:46.677,00:55:48.470,This time.
00:55:48.470,00:55:50.931,"She'd get better, and then she'd get worse."
00:55:50.931,00:55:53.309,"Recently, a lot worse."
00:55:55.144,00:56:01.441,"That symbol that was cut in the dead guy's hand, does it have something to do with this?"
00:56:01.441,00:56:03.777,"I'm a cop, John, remember?"
00:56:03.777,00:56:09.033,You don't walk off the roof of a building without leaving something behind.
00:56:09.033,00:56:14.163,"And I showed you everything she left behind in that box, but..."
00:56:14.163,00:56:16.123,Maybe she left something else.
00:56:16.123,00:56:18.876,Not something a cop would find.
00:56:21.045,00:56:23.172,Something just for you.
00:56:24.548,00:56:26.800,"You were her twin, Angela."
00:56:26.800,00:56:28.719,Twins tend to think alike.
00:56:28.719,00:56:30.595,I'm not like my sister.
00:56:30.595,00:56:32.264,But you were once.
00:56:32.264,00:56:34.766,When you were kids.
00:56:34.766,00:56:37.686,When you'd spend every second with each other.
00:56:37.686,00:56:39.897,"You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it."
00:56:39.897,00:56:41.606,"You'd get hurt, she'd cry."
00:56:41.606,00:56:43.234,That was a long time ago.
00:56:43.234,00:56:45.361,That kind of bond doesn't just disappear.
00:56:45.361,00:56:47.238,There is nothing here.
00:56:47.988,00:56:49.907,Hey.
00:56:49.907,00:56:51.533,Come on.
00:56:51.533,00:56:54.995,She thought it up right here.
00:56:54.995,00:56:56.163,She knew you'd come.
00:56:56.163,00:57:01.835,"She counted on you to see what she saw feel what she felt, know what she knew."
00:57:01.835,00:57:03.587,"What did she do, Angela?"
00:57:03.587,00:57:04.629,How should I know?
00:57:04.629,00:57:06.131,"What did she do, Angela?"
00:57:06.131,00:57:07.299,I don't know.
00:57:08.384,00:57:10.052,What would you do?
00:57:10.052,00:57:11.929,What would you do?
00:57:11.929,00:57:13.722,"What did she do, Angela?"
00:57:13.722,00:57:15.140,You know what she did.
00:57:15.140,00:57:16.767,"What did she do, Angela?"
00:57:16.767,00:57:18.060,You know what she did.
00:57:18.060,00:57:19.937,What are you afraid of?
00:57:19.937,00:57:20.979,What did she do?!
00:57:20.979,00:57:22.731,I don't know!
00:57:40.124,00:57:42.459,When we were girls...
00:57:45.212,00:57:48.424,we would leave each other messages.
00:57:50.801,00:57:52.803,In light.
00:57:55.264,00:57:57.224,In breath.
00:58:01.353,00:58:03.314,On the windows.
00:58:06.691,00:58:10.695,"ANGELA: John, there is no 17th act in Corinthians."
00:58:12.781,00:58:16.660,Corinthians goes to 21 acts in the Bible in hell.
00:58:17.911,00:58:19.746,They have Bibles in hell?
00:58:19.746,00:58:22.540,CONSTANTINE: It paints a different view of Revelations.
00:58:22.540,00:58:28.464,"Says the world will not end by God's hand, but be reborn in the embrace of the damned."
00:58:28.464,00:58:30.215,Though if you ask me...
00:58:30.715,00:58:32.634,fire's fire.
00:58:32.634,00:58:36.596,"16:29, 16:30."
00:58:37.181,00:58:38.349,"Oh, my."
00:58:38.349,00:58:41.393,This is certainly not good.
00:58:41.393,00:58:45.522,The sins of the father would only be exceeded by the sins of the son.
00:58:45.981,00:58:47.191,Whose son?
00:58:47.191,00:58:49.567,"But he can't cross over, B."
00:58:49.567,00:58:50.986,Impossible to cross over.
00:58:50.986,00:58:52.363,Whose son? God's son?
00:58:52.363,00:58:54.156,"No, the other one."
00:58:54.156,00:58:55.991,The Devil had a son too.
00:58:55.991,00:58:57.826,Here it is.
00:58:57.826,00:59:01.705,"This is the sign of Mammon, the son of the devil."
00:59:01.705,00:59:06.251,"Well, hold on, it says here-- Wh-- CONSTANTINE: Beeman?"
00:59:06.251,00:59:07.627,Yeah.
00:59:07.627,00:59:09.880,"Sorry, I'm-- I'm sorry, no, I'm right here."
00:59:09.880,00:59:11.423,Um...
00:59:11.423,00:59:22.267,It says Mammon has no patience for his father's rule and yearns to forge his own kingdom of fire and blood.
00:59:28.106,00:59:29.358,Yeah.
00:59:29.358,00:59:33.653,Mammon would be the last demon we'd ever want crossing over to our plane.
00:59:33.653,00:59:37.615,"No, wait-wait wait- wait-wait-wait, I'm reading-- Seems to be a loophole."
00:59:37.615,00:59:39.076,Always a catch.
00:59:39.076,00:59:40.077,Um...
00:59:40.077,00:59:46.750,"It says first Mammon would have to possess a very, very powerful psychic."
00:59:46.750,00:59:48.126,Isabel.
00:59:48.126,00:59:49.836,But that wouldn't be enough.
00:59:49.836,00:59:54.925,"To cross over, Mammon would need, um, divine assistance."
00:59:56.009,00:59:57.719,To cross over...
00:59:57.719,01:00:00.472,Mammon would need the help of God.
01:00:01.265,01:00:03.267,The help of God?
01:00:03.267,01:00:12.192,It says-- CONSTANTINE: Beeman?
01:00:12.192,01:00:14.528,"John, look..."
01:00:14.528,01:00:23.412,"I know you've never had much faith, you've never had much reason to, but that doesn't mean that we don't have faith..."
01:00:23.912,01:00:25.789,in you.
01:00:28.833,01:00:31.669,Beeman? Beeman?
01:00:32.087,01:00:34.506,Drive. Fast.
01:00:50.647,01:00:51.982,Beeman!
01:00:52.983,01:00:54.859,Sulfur.
01:00:55.902,01:00:57.404,Beeman!
01:01:02.075,01:01:03.994,Beeman!
01:02:13.771,01:02:16.107,Wasn't just Isabel.
01:02:16.941,01:02:19.027,I used to see things too.
01:02:20.778,01:02:21.821,But...
01:02:22.739,01:02:25.158,"you already knew that, didn't you?"
01:02:25.158,01:02:26.784,"Go home, Angela."
01:02:26.784,01:02:28.370,I need to understand.
01:02:28.370,01:02:31.248,"You don't wanna know what's out there, trust me on this."
01:02:31.248,01:02:33.208,I'm stronger than Isabel.
01:02:33.208,01:02:35.293,"Your sister embraced her gift, you denied yours."
01:02:35.293,01:02:37.462,Denial is a better idea.
01:02:37.462,01:02:38.880,It's why you're still alive.
01:02:38.880,01:02:40.048,Stick with me...
01:02:40.716,01:02:42.300,that will change.
01:02:42.300,01:02:44.428,I don't need another ghost following me around.
01:02:44.428,01:02:46.263,"John, they killed my sister."
01:02:51.184,01:02:54.020,I'd trade places with her if I could.
01:02:56.940,01:02:59.776,I used to pretend that I didn't.
01:03:00.444,01:03:03.071,That I didn't see things.
01:03:03.071,01:03:04.781,And...
01:03:05.823,01:03:09.494,"by the time we were 10, they started forcing her to take..."
01:03:10.454,01:03:13.123,antipsychotics and...
01:03:13.915,01:03:14.999,have treatments.
01:03:14.999,01:03:20.380,"They would come for her, and she'd look at me, and she'd say to me, Tell them."
01:03:20.380,01:03:24.551,"Why don't you tell them, Angie, that you can see 'em too?"
01:03:25.469,01:03:26.970,But I lied.
01:03:27.596,01:03:29.765,I said...
01:03:31.141,01:03:34.394,I don't see anything.
01:03:34.394,01:03:36.813,Until one day...
01:03:37.606,01:03:40.317,I finally stopped seeing.
01:03:41.693,01:03:44.988,"I abandoned her, John."
01:03:44.988,01:03:47.282,I left her all alone.
01:03:54.623,01:03:57.125,I need to see what she saw.
01:03:58.835,01:04:00.671,Please.
01:04:04.800,01:04:08.762,"You do this, there's no turning back."
01:04:10.597,01:04:12.683,You see them...
01:04:13.517,01:04:15.686,they see you.
01:04:16.353,01:04:17.646,Understand?
01:04:19.022,01:04:20.816,Yeah.
01:04:26.863,01:04:28.824,Sure.
01:05:06.862,01:05:11.908,"So do I have to take the rest of my clothes off, or can I leave them on?"
01:05:18.164,01:05:20.166,John?
01:05:20.166,01:05:22.168,I'm thinking.
01:05:26.130,01:05:28.299,John?
01:05:28.299,01:05:30.510,On is fine.
01:05:43.022,01:05:44.858,So why water?
01:05:44.858,01:05:46.693,It's a universal conduit.
01:05:46.693,01:05:50.864,Lubricates the transition from one plane to another.
01:05:50.864,01:05:53.074,Now ask me if there's water in hell.
01:05:53.074,01:05:55.744,Is there water in hell?
01:05:56.994,01:05:58.496,Sit.
01:05:59.790,01:06:04.294,"Normally, only a portion of the body has to be suspended, but..."
01:06:06.713,01:06:08.840,you wanted the crash course.
01:06:08.840,01:06:11.802,"Yeah, I wanted the crash course."
01:06:11.802,01:06:13.261,"So, um..."
01:06:14.262,01:06:16.473,"So, what's gonna happen?"
01:06:16.473,01:06:18.349,Lie down.
01:06:18.349,01:06:20.560,What do you--?
01:06:20.560,01:06:22.604,You have to be fully submerged.
01:06:24.355,01:06:25.941,For how long?
01:06:26.483,01:06:28.526,As long as it takes.
01:06:30.111,01:06:31.988,Okay.
01:06:38.411,01:06:39.996,Take a deep one.
01:08:22.933,01:08:24.350,"Oh, God."
01:08:25.727,01:08:29.272,"Oh, God, all those people."
01:08:29.689,01:08:31.775,"Oh, Isabel."
01:08:32.525,01:08:33.860,I've always known.
01:08:33.860,01:08:35.987,I've always known where they are.
01:08:35.987,01:08:37.614,I've always known where to...
01:08:37.614,01:08:39.699,"Where to find them, where to..."
01:08:39.699,01:08:42.035,Where to aim and where to duck...
01:08:42.035,01:08:43.703,And I've always known where they were.
01:08:43.703,01:08:45.371,I've always known that it wasn't luck.
01:08:45.371,01:08:47.832,Always known that it wasn't luck.
01:08:47.832,01:08:49.042,I've always known.
01:08:49.042,01:08:52.169,I've always...
01:08:52.169,01:08:56.758,I've always...
01:09:02.179,01:09:03.306,Angela.
01:09:08.103,01:09:10.187,Someone was here.
01:09:36.881,01:09:38.675,It was his.
01:09:39.634,01:09:41.678,Rolling.
01:09:43.638,01:09:45.682,Not a ball.
01:09:47.308,01:09:49.477,Something smaller.
01:09:51.980,01:09:53.731,Something shiny.
01:10:26.389,01:10:28.641,Balthazar.
01:11:00.882,01:11:02.800,Sorry.
01:11:09.766,01:11:12.560,Can you just kill him?
01:11:12.560,01:11:14.395,What about the balance?
01:11:14.395,01:11:18.108,Half-breed tipped the scales when he started killing my friends.
01:11:18.108,01:11:20.944,I'm just adding some counterweight.
01:11:54.518,01:12:05.989,"John, I really want-- Think of it as a bulletproof vest."
01:12:12.328,01:12:13.496,Uh-uh.
01:12:13.496,01:12:15.665,I'm coming with you.
01:12:16.791,01:12:19.460,You're staying in the car.
01:12:43.651,01:12:44.819,Fire?
01:12:44.819,01:12:46.654,I was born of this.
01:12:46.654,01:12:51.575,"How's Mammon crossing over, you half-breed piece of shit?"
01:12:55.288,01:12:59.042,That's better. Au naturel.
01:13:05.882,01:13:08.259,Stay in the car.
01:13:08.259,01:13:09.927,Wait here.
01:13:11.428,01:13:12.889,Men.
01:13:26.402,01:13:27.987,"Don't fight it, Johnny boy."
01:13:29.280,01:13:30.614,Enjoy it.
01:14:04.899,01:14:07.651,We'll see you very soon.
01:14:09.153,01:14:11.114,"Not really, no."
01:14:11.114,01:14:13.657,You can't cheat it this time.
01:14:13.657,01:14:16.493,You're going back to hell.
01:14:16.493,01:14:18.204,True.
01:14:18.204,01:14:19.580,But you're not.
01:14:20.790,01:14:22.333,What are you doing?
01:14:22.333,01:14:23.960,I'm reading you your last rites.
01:14:23.960,01:14:27.880,Spare me your remedial incantations.
01:14:27.880,01:14:30.383,You do know what it is to truly be forgiven?
01:14:30.383,01:14:33.136,To be welcomed into the Kingdom of God.
01:14:33.136,01:14:35.638,A demon in heaven.
01:14:35.638,01:14:39.350,I'd love to be a fly on that wall.
01:14:39.350,01:14:40.977,You're not a priest.
01:14:40.977,01:14:43.813,You have no power.
01:14:44.897,01:14:50.361,"Just tell me how Mammon is crossing over, and you can go back to your shithole."
01:14:52.947,01:14:54.490,"Okay, Bally."
01:14:55.408,01:14:56.700,Enjoy it.
01:15:06.627,01:15:11.590,May God have mercy on you and grant you the pardon of all your sins.
01:15:11.590,01:15:16.679,"Whosesoever sins you remit on Earth, they are remitted unto them in heaven."
01:15:18.722,01:15:19.932,How? How's he doing it?
01:15:19.932,01:15:21.517,No.
01:15:21.517,01:15:23.060,"No, I can't."
01:15:24.645,01:15:33.821,Grant your child entry into thy kingdom in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
01:15:33.821,01:15:35.031,Amen--!
01:15:38.742,01:15:42.205,The blood of God.
01:15:42.205,01:15:43.664,He found it.
01:15:43.664,01:15:52.882,Whatever killed the son of God will give birth to the son of the devil.
01:15:55.551,01:15:56.760,By the way...
01:15:59.555,01:16:03.059,you have to ask for absolution to be forgiven...
01:16:04.394,01:16:05.895,asshole.
01:16:09.565,01:16:13.236,My work here is done.
01:16:14.237,01:16:15.821,What are you laughing at?
01:16:15.821,01:16:16.822,She...
01:16:16.822,01:16:19.367,was my only mission...
01:16:19.367,01:16:23.913,and you brought her right to us.
01:16:26.582,01:16:30.044,So does this walking fast mean you've found something?
01:16:30.044,01:16:32.380,Jesus didn't die from being nailed to a cross.
01:16:32.380,01:16:34.590,He was killed by a soldier's spear.
01:16:34.590,01:16:37.051,The Spear of Destiny.
01:16:37.051,01:16:40.096,"I'm a Catholic, John."
01:16:48.563,01:16:53.817,I drew out the sister as you asked.
01:16:53.817,01:16:59.574,She's been made flesh and ready.
01:16:59.574,01:17:02.659,So much power.
01:17:03.578,01:17:09.125,"Now, if you grant me my resurrection, I shall serve."
01:17:11.419,01:17:12.420,Wait.
01:17:12.420,01:17:15.131,But I did as we agreed.
01:17:15.131,01:17:17.467,No. Please.
01:17:17.467,01:17:18.884,No--!
01:17:21.512,01:17:26.725,Beeman said Mammon needed divine assistance to cross over.
01:17:27.684,01:17:31.272,How's the blood of God's only son?
01:17:31.272,01:17:34.108,ANGELA: The stains on the spear.
01:17:35.067,01:17:36.193,Yeah.
01:17:36.193,01:17:38.112,So he gets the spear.
01:17:38.112,01:17:40.531,He still has to locate a powerful psychic.
01:17:41.491,01:17:43.284,Not really.
01:17:46.162,01:17:47.663,Twins.
01:17:49.290,01:17:51.083,Where's the amulet?
01:17:52.168,01:17:58.382,"I don't know, I must have left it in the-- What's wrong?"
01:17:58.382,01:18:33.334,"I don't know, I just feel-- Bird on a ladder."
01:18:33.334,01:18:34.502,Sorry.
01:18:39.715,01:18:40.799,Wait here.
01:18:40.799,01:18:42.176,Yeah.
01:18:45.054,01:18:48.724,"Who's a rat in a dress now, huh, bitch?"
01:19:01.987,01:19:04.657,Have you lost what little mind you have?
01:19:04.657,01:19:05.824,Don't.
01:19:07.243,01:19:10.079,I need to use the chair.
01:19:10.079,01:19:14.458,I offer no aid to one side or the other.
01:19:15.167,01:19:16.252,The balance.
01:19:16.252,01:19:18.254,Screw the balance.
01:19:24.051,01:19:25.344,You dare?
01:19:25.344,01:19:26.762,In my house?!
01:19:29.473,01:19:31.141,Is this neutral?
01:19:31.141,01:19:32.809,Bullshit.
01:19:32.809,01:19:35.896,"You're the only one still playing by the rules, Midnite."
01:19:35.896,01:19:40.192,"And while you've been imitating Switzerland, people are dying."
01:19:40.192,01:19:44.614,"Hennessy, Beeman, they were your friends once too, remember?"
01:19:45.281,01:19:46.949,I need your help!
01:19:50.244,01:19:53.122,Consider it a last request.
01:19:56.584,01:20:01.297,You play a dangerous game.
01:20:06.552,01:20:08.763,"Two-hundred-dollar shirt, by the way."
01:20:11.098,01:20:15.394,MIDNITE: That little shit has been trying to climb out of his father's shadow for eons.
01:20:15.394,01:20:20.650,I'd hate to think what he would do to this world if he ever broke through.
01:20:23.402,01:20:26.155,CONSTANTINE: Forgot how big it was.
01:20:26.155,01:20:30.826,MIDNITE: Two hundred souls passed through this wood and steel at Sing Sing.
01:20:30.826,01:20:32.662,Yeah.
01:20:35.665,01:20:38.000,Which way's east?
01:20:55.685,01:20:58.521,How many years since you've surfed?
01:20:59.563,01:21:01.732,Like riding a bike.
01:21:01.732,01:21:03.859,"No, not really."
01:21:06.320,01:21:09.406,Tell me...
01:21:10.407,01:21:15.037,Definitely mostly not about the girl.
01:21:19.709,01:21:22.753,Wha-- Cold.
01:21:22.753,01:21:24.380,Little flavor?
01:21:48.278,01:21:49.405,Sure about this?
01:21:49.405,01:21:50.573,No.
01:22:40.456,01:22:42.291,Midnite!
01:22:47.838,01:22:49.423,Any luck?
01:22:49.423,01:22:51.133,That's a word for it.
01:22:51.133,01:22:53.009,Holy shit.
01:22:53.009,01:22:54.970,"You're Papa Midnite, aren't you?"
01:23:02.311,01:23:06.982,And how exactly do you intend on getting close enough to use these?
01:23:08.859,01:23:12.279,"CHAS: Well, they did not leave her unguarded."
01:23:12.279,01:23:18.494,Half-breeds are most vulnerable when their outer skin is breached by holy water.
01:23:18.494,01:23:26.335,"Certain objects, most notably either of the two crosses of Isteria have been used by even the unordained to bless and sanctify all commonly occurring waters."
01:23:26.335,01:23:27.503,Even rain.
01:23:29.045,01:23:30.673,Maybe if...
01:23:34.635,01:23:38.514,"There's no use sitting on the bench if you're not ready to play, right?"
01:23:38.514,01:23:43.727,So you wouldn't happen to have one of those enchanted crosses sitting around here in a cabinet maybe we could take with us.
01:23:44.478,01:23:51.443,"Look, John, no offense, I just don't think that it's a great idea, you know, you going on a solo mission to save the world."
01:23:51.443,01:23:53.069,I-- That's what I-- That's my vote.
01:23:53.069,01:23:58.784,"I don't know what pops thinks, but that's-- Take him, John."
01:23:58.784,01:24:00.536,Kill him after.
01:24:05.749,01:24:09.795,"If you get back, see me about membership. Maybe."
01:24:09.795,01:24:12.715,Okay. I will.
01:24:17.386,01:24:18.846,What are you doing?
01:24:18.846,01:24:19.972,Praying.
01:24:19.972,01:24:21.431,Praying.
01:24:21.431,01:24:22.641,Okay.
01:24:23.642,01:24:25.644,Come on.
01:25:22.451,01:25:24.286,"CHAS: Half-breeds, right?"
01:25:26.747,01:25:31.835,"A birth like this, they're-- They're definitely gonna be guarding her, right? Definitely."
01:25:31.835,01:25:33.629,Yeah.
01:25:36.381,01:25:38.258,We can get through 'em.
01:25:38.258,01:25:41.011,"I mean, that cross has gotta work, right?"
01:25:41.011,01:25:42.596,Right?
01:25:42.596,01:25:45.307,It's not always like it is in the books.
01:26:34.773,01:26:36.900,CHAS: What is that?
01:26:36.900,01:26:39.194,Hellspeak.
01:26:41.697,01:26:43.907,You know what to do.
01:26:47.036,01:26:48.203,I'm okay.
01:26:50.497,01:26:52.541,Sure.
01:27:04.094,01:27:06.847,One last show.
01:27:40.589,01:27:42.091,Hi.
01:27:42.966,01:27:44.259,My name's John.
01:27:46.344,01:27:50.306,You are in violation of the balance.
01:27:50.306,01:27:52.559,Leave immediately...
01:27:53.227,01:27:55.062,or I will deport you.
01:27:58.023,01:27:59.816,All of you.
01:28:07.241,01:28:09.325,Go to hell.
01:28:14.790,01:28:16.499,Holy water?
01:29:33.952,01:29:36.371,Angela.
01:30:08.153,01:30:09.445,"Uh, John?"
01:30:12.532,01:30:14.034,John.
01:30:19.122,01:30:20.540,Shit.
01:30:46.400,01:30:47.609,CONSTANTINE: Pull!
01:31:28.858,01:31:30.360,Angela.
01:31:53.549,01:31:54.926,"Angela, what is it?"
01:31:57.720,01:32:04.227,Insi-- Get it out.
01:32:18.200,01:32:19.951,Get it out!
01:32:20.285,01:32:21.535,Get it--!
01:33:06.664,01:33:07.916,"Oh, my God."
01:33:14.881,01:33:16.466,"Not bad, kid."
01:33:19.469,01:33:21.595,Not bad. You hear that?
01:33:21.595,01:33:23.473,You know why that is?
01:33:23.473,01:33:24.974,this is Kramer.
01:33:24.974,01:33:35.110,"Chas Kramer, ass-- Chas!"
01:33:43.785,01:33:46.620,"You're right, John."
01:33:47.705,01:33:49.749,It's not like the books.
01:33:50.584,01:33:52.085,No...
01:33:53.169,01:33:55.171,it isn't.
01:34:15.984,01:34:18.736,"Into the light, I command thee."
01:34:19.821,01:34:22.698,"Into the light, I command thee."
01:34:24.326,01:34:29.164,"Into the light, I command thee."
01:34:29.164,01:34:33.042,"Into the light, I command thee."
01:34:33.042,01:34:36.838,"Into the light, I command thee."
01:34:39.882,01:34:42.969,Your ego is astounding.
01:34:42.969,01:34:45.054,Gabriel.
01:34:45.054,01:34:46.431,Figures.
01:34:47.390,01:34:51.019,And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.
01:34:51.019,01:34:52.395,"You judging me now, John?"
01:34:54.730,01:34:56.941,"Betrayal, murder, genocide..."
01:34:57.609,01:34:58.860,call me provincial.
01:34:58.860,01:35:03.072,I am simply seeking to inspire mankind to all that was intended.
01:35:03.072,01:35:07.619,By handing Earth over to the son of the devil?
01:35:07.619,01:35:09.287,Help me here.
01:35:13.416,01:35:14.708,You're handed this...
01:35:15.418,01:35:17.462,"precious gift, right?"
01:35:18.630,01:35:22.716,Each one of you granted redemption from the Creator.
01:35:23.593,01:35:26.179,"Murderers, rapists and molesters..."
01:35:26.179,01:35:30.975,"all of you, you just have to repent, and God takes you into his bosom."
01:35:33.853,01:35:39.568,"In all the worlds in all the universe, no other creature can make such a boast, save man."
01:35:41.861,01:35:43.405,It's not fair.
01:35:47.200,01:35:54.583,"If sweet, sweet God loves you so, then I'll make you worthy of his love."
01:35:56.000,01:35:59.254,I've been watching you for a long time.
01:35:59.254,01:36:04.217,It's only in the face of horror that you truly find your nobler selves.
01:36:04.217,01:36:08.179,And you can be so noble.
01:36:10.724,01:36:11.933,So...
01:36:12.975,01:36:14.768,I'll bring you pain...
01:36:16.020,01:36:17.980,I'll bring you horror...
01:36:19.691,01:36:21.943,so that you may rise above it.
01:36:26.615,01:36:29.867,So that those of you who survive this reign of hell on Earth...
01:36:30.660,01:36:33.829,will be worthy of God's love.
01:36:33.829,01:36:34.997,Gabriel...
01:36:36.124,01:36:38.627,you're insane.
01:36:40.211,01:36:43.797,The road to salvation begins tonight.
01:36:44.257,01:36:46.134,Right now.
01:37:27.592,01:37:30.844,I know I'm not one of your favorites.
01:37:32.096,01:37:35.099,I'm not even welcome in your house.
01:37:36.434,01:37:39.521,But I could use a little attention.
01:37:42.691,01:37:44.526,Please.
01:38:30.780,01:38:33.282,Come forth.
01:38:52.926,01:38:54.928,Hurry.
01:39:11.987,01:39:14.073,Mammon...
01:39:14.073,01:39:15.909,son of Satan...
01:39:16.659,01:39:20.747,I unleash you unto this world.
01:40:14.801,01:40:16.427,CONSTANTINE: Lu...
01:40:16.427,01:40:18.680,What took you so long?
01:40:18.680,01:40:20.306,"Hello, John."
01:40:21.683,01:40:24.226,"John, hello."
01:40:29.899,01:40:32.067,You're the one soul...
01:40:33.068,01:40:36.823,I would come up here to collect myself.
01:40:36.823,01:40:38.533,Mm-hmm.
01:40:40.159,01:40:41.828,So I've heard.
01:40:43.371,01:40:44.831,You mind?
01:40:45.832,01:40:48.334,"Oh, go-- Go right ahead."
01:40:49.002,01:40:50.628,Coffin nail.
01:40:50.628,01:40:53.046,"Very fitting, John."
01:40:55.591,01:41:01.138,"You know, when you cut too deep, you cut the tendons finger movement goes out the window."
01:41:02.431,01:41:04.600,Let me help you.
01:41:15.820,01:41:17.572,See?
01:41:19.281,01:41:26.121,"Sonny, I've got a whole theme park full of red delights for you."
01:41:26.121,01:41:28.541,"Well, aren't you a peach?"
01:41:29.918,01:41:34.213,I didn't think you would make the same mistake twice.
01:41:38.718,01:41:40.219,And you didn't...
01:41:41.429,01:41:42.638,did you?
01:41:43.472,01:41:45.224,So how's the family?
01:41:45.224,01:41:47.393,SATAN: Family's doing just fine.
01:41:47.393,01:41:49.311,"Busy, busy, busy, busy!"
01:41:49.311,01:41:51.564,Need a vacation.
01:41:51.564,01:41:55.276,"Word is, that kid of yours is a chip off the old block."
01:41:55.276,01:41:58.446,"Well, one does what one can."
01:41:58.446,01:42:00.322,He's in the other room.
01:42:00.322,01:42:03.200,Boys will be boys.
01:42:04.243,01:42:05.912,With Gabriel.
01:42:07.747,01:42:11.417,"Hm, no accounting for taste, really."
01:42:11.417,01:42:14.295,They have the Spear of Destiny.
01:42:16.714,01:42:19.884,They have the Spear of Destiny.
01:42:28.810,01:42:32.145,Or is it another one of your cons?
01:42:34.065,01:42:36.525,Go look for yourself.
01:42:39.320,01:42:42.657,"You've waited 20 years for me, Lu..."
01:42:43.365,01:42:46.661,what's another 20 seconds?
01:43:51.100,01:43:52.101,Lucifer.
01:43:52.101,01:43:56.522,"This world is mine, in time."
01:43:56.522,01:44:00.943,"You, best of all of us, Gabriel, should understand..."
01:44:01.569,01:44:04.155,ambition.
01:44:04.655,01:44:07.366,Son of perdition.
01:44:08.241,01:44:09.577,Little horn.
01:44:11.537,01:44:13.915,Most unclean.
01:44:13.915,01:44:16.792,I do miss the old names.
01:44:17.418,01:44:19.795,"Time to go home, son."
01:44:19.795,01:44:21.756,I will smite thee...
01:44:22.423,01:44:25.634,in His honor.
01:44:30.431,01:44:35.937,Looks like somebody doesn't have your back anymore.
01:44:53.454,01:44:54.914,Father?
01:45:18.646,01:45:20.355,So...
01:45:27.238,01:45:28.614,So...
01:45:28.614,01:45:30.658,"Yeah, what do you want?"
01:45:30.658,01:45:32.827,An extension?
01:45:37.330,01:45:39.500,The sister...
01:45:40.417,01:45:41.836,Isabel.
01:45:43.545,01:45:45.547,What about her?
01:45:47.382,01:45:50.011,Let her go home.
01:45:52.263,01:45:57.392,You're willing to give up your life so she can go to heaven?
01:46:07.195,01:46:08.237,Fine.
01:46:08.237,01:46:10.114,It's done.
01:46:12.574,01:46:16.204,"Time to go, John."
01:46:16.204,01:46:17.621,Yeah.
01:47:15.888,01:47:18.140,The sacrifice.
01:47:29.442,01:47:30.861,No.
01:47:30.861,01:47:35.783,This one belongs to me.
01:47:45.500,01:47:46.585,No.
01:47:46.585,01:47:51.590,"You will live, John Constantine."
01:47:54.385,01:47:56.053,You will live.
01:47:58.347,01:48:00.349,So you will have...
01:48:02.559,01:48:05.313,the chance to prove...
01:48:07.064,01:48:13.321,that your soul truly belongs in hell.
01:48:15.864,01:48:18.742,"Oh, you will live."
01:48:23.580,01:48:27.168,You will live.
01:49:41.325,01:49:43.452,Thank you.
01:49:45.704,01:49:47.831,No problem.
01:50:03.680,01:50:05.640,CONSTANTINE: Human.
01:50:07.309,01:50:10.271,You don't deserve to be human.
01:50:11.480,01:50:12.940,Do you want revenge?
01:50:12.940,01:50:16.318,Is that what you're thinking right now?
01:50:18.653,01:50:20.364,Do it.
01:50:21.574,01:50:23.325,Do it.
01:50:24.617,01:50:26.870,Seek revenge.
01:50:26.870,01:50:29.748,End my life.
01:50:29.748,01:50:31.624,Go on.
01:50:33.668,01:50:35.337,Be the hand of God.
01:50:35.337,01:50:37.839,It's your choice.
01:50:37.839,01:50:40.217,It's always been your choice.
01:50:45.347,01:50:47.099,Yeah.
01:50:52.438,01:50:54.982,That's called pain.
01:50:54.982,01:50:56.649,Get used to it.
01:51:02.823,01:51:05.284,"You could've shot me, John!"
01:51:07.119,01:51:10.164,You chose a higher path!
01:51:11.415,01:51:14.335,Look how well you're doing!
01:51:39.692,01:51:41.903,Nice spot.
01:51:46.033,01:51:47.826,I have something for you.
01:51:50.454,01:51:53.582,Something tells me you're not a flowers kind of guy.
01:51:56.335,01:51:59.046,"Oh, how thoughtful."
01:52:03.842,01:52:05.010,John...
01:52:07.304,01:52:09.097,why are you giving me this?
01:52:09.973,01:52:11.600,Rules.
01:52:11.600,01:52:13.394,Hide it.
01:52:13.394,01:52:16.729,Somewhere no one will ever be able to find it.
01:52:17.481,01:52:19.274,Not even me.
01:52:19.274,01:52:21.235,Ah.
01:52:23.278,01:52:25.406,Always a catch.
01:52:26.574,01:52:28.409,Yeah.
01:52:41.255,01:52:43.257,So...
01:52:44.633,01:52:47.928,I've got some cleaning up to do.
01:52:51.557,01:52:53.225,I'll...
01:52:53.726,01:52:56.186,see you around.
01:52:58.564,01:53:00.608,I'd like that.
01:53:30.095,01:53:33.432,CONSTANTINE: I guess there's a plan for all of us.
01:53:33.432,01:53:34.849,I had to die...
01:53:35.225,01:53:36.685,twice...
01:53:36.685,01:53:39.062,just to figure that out.
01:53:39.062,01:53:44.318,"Like the book says, He works His work in mysterious ways."
01:53:44.318,01:53:45.944,Some people like it...
01:53:46.570,01:53:49.323,some people don't.
01:59:42.550,01:59:44.845,"You did good, kid."
