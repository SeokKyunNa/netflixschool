00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys, just start without me.

5
00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:46.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll catch up!

13
00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:37.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now what?

14
00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

15
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

16
00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:58.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our battle ended 500 years ago!

17
00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, now I'm ready for a rematch.

18
00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:03.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Took you long enough!

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:21.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've grown stronger.

21
00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:32.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
500 years in the Spirit Realm,
you pick up a thing or two.

22
00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:35.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have taken the chi
of every master here.

23
00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No!

24
00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:41.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And soon I will have your power, too.

25
00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:45.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When will you realize?
The more you take, the less you have.

26
00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With your chi,

27
00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:11.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will finally be able
to return to the mortal world.

28
00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And this time, you won't be there
to stop me.

30
00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was never my destiny to stop you.

31
00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have set another on that path.

32
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I will find him...

33
00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and take his chi, too.

34
00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:54.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Justice is about to be served!

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll have two Justice Platters,
please.

40
00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Um, three.
-Three.

41
00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And a few tofu buns.

42
00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, the spicy noodle soup for Tigress.
Did you want extra sauce with that?

43
00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She wants it on the side.

44
00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:58.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On the side.
-On the side.

46
00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:01.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Go, Dragon Warrior!
You can do it!

47
00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go, Dragon Warrior!

Defend the Valley!

49
00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dragon Warrior!

50
00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go, Dragon Warrior!

51
00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:11.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah! Defend the Valley!

52
00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yee-haw!

53
00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You guys aren't doing
the Dramatic Pose, are you?

54
00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do we have to strike a pose
every time we land?

55
00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You guys, never underestimate
the power of a dramatic entrance.

56
00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've heard about some masters who can win
a fight just by throwing open a door.

57
00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh!

58
00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dramatic entrance?

59
00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:33.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Master Shifu.

60
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The Dragon Warrior is correct.

61
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? I was just making, uh...

62
00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I mean, yeah. I am.

63
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:41.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.

64
00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hence, the dramatic entrance.

65
00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoa!

66
00:05:57.065 --> 00:06:00.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nice dramatic entrance.
What's the occasion?

67
00:06:00.234 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Today will be my final class.

68
00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your final... Wait.

69
00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't even know you were sick!
Although you have been looking a little...

70
00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:08.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm not sick.
-Healthy.

71
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A little healthy. A lot, actually.

72
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

73
00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:16.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My final class, because from now on
your training will be in the hands

74
00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of the Dragon Warrior.

75
00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:21.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

76
00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me, teach? I mean, why not Tigress?

77
00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's always telling everyone what to do.

78
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Be quiet, Po.
-You see what I mean?

79
00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:32.642 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tigress is not the Dragon Warrior.
You are.

80
00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, they're the Five.

81
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What could I teach them?

82
00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is always something
more to learn, even for a master.

83
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For instance,
let me show you another move...

84
00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the Dramatic Exit.

85
00:06:46.697 --> 00:06:47.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's that?

86
00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:52.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow! Are you kidding me?

87
00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's... Where'd he go?

88
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Master.

89
00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[scoffs] He's gone, guys. It's cool.

90
00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We await your instruction, Master.

91
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All you have to lose is our respect.

92
00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, seriously, how bad can it be?

93
00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:13.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very bad! Very, very bad!

94
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:15.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, okay. Let's switch it up.

95
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Monkey! Immovable Mountain Stance!

96
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, Master!

97
00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, ah...
Tigress, Tornado Back Flip!

98
00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, Master.

100
00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:26.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no! Fire!

101
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fire! Stop!

102
00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:29.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry! My fault.

00:07:34.912 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Viper and Tigress, do,

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:47.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry.

Good job, Po.

111
00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah.

112
00:07:57.768 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you at least learn
a little something?

113
00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:01.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

114
00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:02.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That you can't teach.

115
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Yeah, that was a complete disaster.

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:16.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[goose 2] Ugh...
I'm glad we're not Po right now.

119
00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

120
00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:19.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[goose 2] What was Shifu thinking?

121
00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:20.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[goose 1] What was Oogway thinking?

123
00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:26.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think he heard us.

124
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:28.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't hear anything.

125
00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:30.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, he said you're a loser.

126
00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:44.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry, Oogway.

127

128
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:48.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you stop doing that?

129
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How was your first day teaching?

130
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Humiliating.
-I heard.

131
00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who told you?
Did Tigress tell you?

132
00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I heard from Monkey,
and Crane, and Mantis,

133
00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and your dad, and Mrs. Chow
from the gift shop,

134
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and those ducks you just passed,

135
00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and Tigress told me.

136
00:09:03.584 --> 00:09:06.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did she also tell you that it'll never
happen again? Because I'm done.

137
00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:08.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Teaching or being humiliated?

138
00:09:09.006 --> 00:09:11.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Both! I don't know why you ever thought
I could teach that class.

139
00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I knew you couldn't.

140
00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:16.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? You set me up to fail? Why?

141
00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you only do what you can do,

142
00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:21.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you will never be
more than you are now.

143
00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't wanna be more!
I like who I am.

144
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't even know who you are.

145
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you...
Of course, I do.

146
00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm the Dragon Warrior.

147
00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:33.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And what exactly does
that mean, Dragon Warrior?

148
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

149
00:09:37.034 --> 00:09:41.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It means, you know, just going around
and punching and kicking.

150
00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Defending the Valley! And stuff.

151
00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Punching and kicking?

152
00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:49.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think that is what
the great Master Oogway saw for you?

153
00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:53.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A 500-year prophecy fulfilled

154
00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:56.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you could spend your days
kicking butt

155
00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:58.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and running through town
high-fiving bunnies?

156
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes?
-No!

157
00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs wearily]

158
00:10:02.226 --> 00:10:04.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oogway saw greatness in you, Po.

159
00:10:04.812 --> 00:10:06.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Against my better judgment.

160
00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
More than you can see in yourself.

161
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Incredible power awaits you.

162
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Power beyond anything you can imagine.

163
00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:35.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow! What was that?

164
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was chi.

165
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:38.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow!

166
00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:40.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's chi?

167
00:10:40.264 --> 00:10:44.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The energy that flows
through all living things.

168
00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:48.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you're saying if I teach,
I'll be able to do cool stuff like that?

169
00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:52.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. I'm saying if you teach,
I'll be able to do cool stuff like that.

170
00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:53.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh...

171
00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:57.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mastering chi requires
mastery of self.

172
00:10:57.573 --> 00:11:02.953 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oogway sat alone in a cave
for 30 years asking one question.

173
00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:04.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Who am I?"

174
00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:06.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Who am I?"

175
00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm lucky if I get five minutes
before you interrupt...

176
00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[groans] So now I have to sit alone
in a cave for 30 years?

177
00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:15.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Eventually.
After you master teaching.

178
00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Teaching? There's no way
I'm ever gonna be like you.

179
00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:21.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not trying to turn you into me.

180
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm trying to turn you into you.

181
00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Turn me into me?

182
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait a second, that makes no...

183
00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:32.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Almost there, Shifu.

184
00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:35.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just a little more confusing
and you'll be the next Oogway.

185
00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:38.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, ah...

186
00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:40.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry, no offense,
Master Oogway. I just...

187
00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:43.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll let you get back
to your eternal peace.

190
00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:26.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is this place?

191
00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh... My brother's farm?

192
00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:30.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah.

193
00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:34.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I stepped on you, would you die?

194
00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:36.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[stammers] Yes.

195
00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:39.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The mortal realm.

196
00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:43.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You hear that, Oogway?
I'm back.

197
00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kai has returned!

199
00:12:50.227 --> 00:12:52.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kai. General Kai.

200
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Supreme Warlord of all China.

-Hmm...

202
00:12:57.151 --> 00:13:00.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Jade Slayer.
Master of Pain.

203
00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You may know me as
the Beast of Vengeance.

204
00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, Maker of Widows?

205
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eh?

206
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I used to work with Oogway.

207
00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:11.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

208
00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:12.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, he was a great warrior.

209
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've heard of Master Oogway.

210
00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, okay, enough.

975
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How's my restaurant?

976
00:53:05.265 --> 00:53:06.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll talk later.

977
00:53:06.474 --> 00:53:09.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now he's on his way here.
He's after you, Po.

978
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:11.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's after all pandas.

979
00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:14.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How long do we have?
-Not long.

980
00:53:14.941 --> 00:53:17.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please, tell me you've mastered chi.

981
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:18.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Here, take the baby.
-Dad! Dad!

982
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:19.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, who belongs to this one?

983
00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:21.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to teach me
the secret chi technique now!

984
00:53:21.948 --> 00:53:24.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, no, I'm afraid
you need more time.

985
00:53:24.326 --> 00:53:26.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone, go get your things!
Let me help you with that.

986
00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:28.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't have more time.
I need to learn it now!

987
00:53:28.246 --> 00:53:30.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, you're not ready.

988
00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:31.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, pack everything!

989
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I am ready.
-Not quite.

990
00:53:33.251 --> 00:53:35.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you talking about?
I've done everything you've asked.

991
00:53:35.587 --> 00:53:38.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've mastered napping, sleeping in,
hammocks, hot tubs.

992
00:53:38.965 --> 00:53:42.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am totally at one with my panda parts.
Now why won't you show me?

993
00:53:42.093 --> 00:53:43.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I don't know it!

994
00:53:47.766 --> 00:53:50.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You what?
-I don't know it, okay? No one does.

995
00:53:51.144 --> 00:53:54.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe we used to.
But... But not anymore.

996
00:53:55.315 --> 00:53:57.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You lied?
-No, I...

997
00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:00.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

998
00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

999
00:54:02.989 --> 00:54:04.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To save your life!

1000
00:54:04.783 --> 00:54:08.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I find out some blade-swinging maniac
is coming for you.

1001
00:54:08.286 --> 00:54:11.373 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What am I supposed to do?
Just let that happen?

1002
00:54:11.665 --> 00:54:16.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes! I'm the Dragon Warrior.
Facing maniacs, that's my job!

1003
00:54:16.336 --> 00:54:19.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But because of you,
I left the Valley unprotected.

1004
00:54:19.464 --> 00:54:22.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I left my friends unprotected!
And now they're all...

1005
00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:25.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're all...
-And you would have been, too.

1006
00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:29.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I lost you once.

1007
00:54:30.141 --> 00:54:31.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am not going to lose you again.

1008
00:54:33.353 --> 00:54:35.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't.

1009
00:54:41.027 --> 00:54:42.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just did.

1010
00:54:53.748 --> 00:54:54.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom! Pick me!

1011
00:55:02.757 --> 00:55:06.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Po, I'm so worried for you that I can't
even enjoy being right about everything.

1012
00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now run, run, run,
as fast as those chubby legs can go!

1013
00:55:10.015 --> 00:55:11.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Run? There's nowhere to run.

1014
00:55:11.766 --> 00:55:13.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what are you going to do?

1015
00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:16.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna stay, and fight that monster.

1016
00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:19.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Po, he may be a monster,
but he's still your father.

1017
00:55:19.941 --> 00:55:21.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not him. Kai!

1018
00:55:21.526 --> 00:55:22.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] No!

1019
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[grunting]

1020
00:56:08.073 --> 00:56:09.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hungry?

1021
00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:11.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I... Not really.

1022
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:13.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, maybe just one.

1023
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:18.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, you weren't
the only one who was lying.

1024
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh?
-I didn't really come along

1025
00:56:21.336 --> 00:56:24.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because I was worried Po would go hungry.

1026
00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was worried about you.

1027
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:27.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Worried that I'd go hungry?

1028
00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:29.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

1029
00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:31.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was worried you'd steal Po from me.

1030
00:56:32.013 --> 00:56:35.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'd what?
-I know. That was crazy.

1031
00:56:36.351 --> 00:56:41.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I realize having you
in Po's life doesn't mean less for me.

1032
00:56:42.148 --> 00:56:44.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It means more for Po.

1033
00:56:46.277 --> 00:56:49.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I'm not in his life.

1034
00:56:50.156 --> 00:56:51.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not anymore.

1035
00:56:51.866 --> 00:56:53.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your son got mad at you.

1036
00:56:54.035 --> 00:56:55.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Welcome to parenthood.

1037
00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:58.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't understand. I lied to him.

1038
00:56:59.165 --> 00:57:00.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He'll never forgive me.

1039
00:57:00.834 --> 00:57:03.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I lied to him for 20 years.

1040
00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:05.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He still thinks he came from an egg.

1041
00:57:06.131 --> 00:57:10.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes, we do the wrong things
for the right reasons.

1042
00:57:18.852 --> 00:57:19.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look.

1043
00:57:19.978 --> 00:57:21.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's hurt.

1044
00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:22.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's confused.

1045
00:57:23.857 --> 00:57:26.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And he still has to save the world.

1046
00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:29.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He needs both his dads.

1047
00:57:48.506 --> 00:57:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This isn't going to work.
-It has to.

1048
00:57:51.217 --> 00:57:52.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not thinking straight.

1049
00:57:52.343 --> 00:57:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I am!
-You're not.

1050
00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:54.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I am!
-No.

1051
00:57:54.804 --> 00:57:55.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes, I am.
-No.

1052
00:57:56.848 --> 00:57:59.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've seen Kai.
I've seen what he can do.

1053
00:57:59.767 --> 00:58:01.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But he hasn't seen what I can do.

1054
00:58:06.065 --> 00:58:07.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The Wuxi Finger Hold?

1055
00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:10.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's my best move.
I just have to get to Kai,

1056
00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:13.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
grab his finger and then skadoosh!
Back to the Spirit Realm.

1057
00:58:13.865 --> 00:58:15.533 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He has an army of jade warriors.

1058
00:58:15.825 --> 00:58:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything they see, he sees.
So there's no sneaking up on him.

1059
00:58:19.204 --> 00:58:21.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You will never get close enough.
-It's gonna work!

1060
00:58:24.209 --> 00:58:27.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He can only be stopped by a master of chi.

1061
00:58:27.086 --> 00:58:29.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, you sound just like Shifu
with the, "Chi, chi, chi."

1062
00:58:29.464 --> 00:58:31.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Chi this. Chi that."
"Chi, chi, chi!"

1063
00:58:31.216 --> 00:58:33.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not a master of chi, okay?

1064
00:58:33.635 --> 00:58:36.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know if I'm the Dragon Warrior.
I don't even know if I'm a panda!

1065
00:58:36.721 --> 00:58:38.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know who I am!

1066
00:58:38.515 --> 00:58:39.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

1067
00:58:40.892 --> 00:58:41.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're right.

1068
00:58:42.143 --> 00:58:43.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's no way I can stop him
and his army.

1069
00:58:48.566 --> 00:58:50.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unless you had an army of your own.

1070
00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:55.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You?

1071
00:58:55.657 --> 00:58:57.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not just me.

1072
00:58:57.742 --> 00:58:58.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Us.

1073
00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All of us.

1074
00:59:10.004 --> 00:59:13.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I finally found my son,
after all these years.

1075
00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:18.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's going to take a lot more than
the end of the world to keep us apart.

1076
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:20.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you don't even know kung fu.

1077
00:59:20.557 --> 00:59:22.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then you will teach us.

1078
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:25.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? I can't teach you kung fu.

1079
