00:01:09.820,00:01:13.156,ALICE: There is a right way to be single.
00:01:13.198,00:01:15.450,Hey. How are you?
00:01:17.411,00:01:19.120,"Oh, when's your wedding?"
00:01:19.162,00:01:21.540,Eighteen months after I meet the right guy.
00:01:22.290,00:01:23.751,Okay.
00:01:23.792,00:01:25.084,ALICE: And a wrong way to be single.
00:01:26.628,00:01:28.380,And then there's this guy.
00:01:35.888,00:01:37.389,Good morning.
00:01:37.431,00:01:40.267,Hi. You want a hand with that?
00:01:47.608,00:01:52.362,"ALICE: We're embarrassed to admit we're single, and try to pretend that we're not."
00:01:53.906,00:01:55.783,NURSE: We need you in Exam Room 3.
00:01:57.659,00:02:00.871,ALICE: We're supposed to act all cheerful and happy about it.
00:02:02.414,00:02:04.291,What?
00:02:04.332,00:02:07.210,But why should we be embarrassed?
00:02:07.252,00:02:13.926,"We're living longer, marrying later, and refusing to leave the party before we're really, really done."
00:02:13.968,00:02:17.262,"So, why do we always tell our stories through relationships?"
00:02:17.304,00:02:18.555,Where's home?
00:02:18.597,00:02:20.975,"Oh, I'm not going home."
00:02:21.850,00:02:23.435,No way.
00:02:32.527,00:02:34.571,Shit.
00:02:36.907,00:02:38.742,"Here, here."
00:02:38.784,00:02:41.411,I gotcha. Here you go.
00:02:43.664,00:02:45.457,I did not think this through.
00:02:50.796,00:02:51.797,I'm Josh.
00:02:52.798,00:02:54.299,I'm Alice.
00:02:58.137,00:03:00.681,ALICE: But this story isn't about relationships.
00:03:00.722,00:03:07.646,"It's about all those times in between when maybe, just maybe, our real life is happening."
00:03:07.688,00:03:09.564,This isn't a break-up. Okay?
00:03:09.606,00:03:12.359,We're just taking some time apart.
00:03:12.400,00:03:14.945,"It's temporary. Like, it's..."
00:03:14.987,00:03:16.363,Bullshit!
00:03:16.404,00:03:19.616,been on my own.
00:03:19.658,00:03:24.287,"I went from living with my parents, to living in a dorm, to living with you."
00:03:24.329,00:03:25.747,"But we're happy, Alice."
00:03:26.581,00:03:27.916,Are we?
00:03:27.958,00:03:29.877,Or are we just boring?
00:03:29.918,00:03:32.713,I'm not boring.
00:03:32.754,00:03:36.257,"I say I'm gonna do things all the time, and I never, ever do them."
00:03:36.299,00:03:41.638,"Like, I'm gonna learn to cook, or take a self-defense class or I'm gonna hike the Grand Canyon, and I never, ever do it."
00:03:41.680,00:03:43.015,That's not my fault.
00:03:43.057,00:03:44.933,You said the boots made your feet hurt.
00:03:44.975,00:03:51.773,"Look, if we really want this to work long term, I need to know who I am alone and I don't want to spend my life wondering What if?"
00:03:51.815,00:03:52.900,This is stupid.
00:03:52.941,00:04:00.074,"The minute you walk out of here you're gonna realize how much shit I do for you and how great I am and how much you need me, and you're gonna start stalking me."
00:04:00.115,00:04:01.449,And that's sad.
00:04:04.078,00:04:05.537,This is gonna be great for both of us.
00:04:05.579,00:04:07.664,Yeah.
00:04:07.706,00:04:10.834,"We need to know what it's like to be single, at least once."
00:04:16.715,00:04:18.508,Can't you just fuck one of my friends?
00:04:19.927,00:04:22.679,Just do something to make me hate you.
00:04:22.721,00:04:25.432,This is gonna be the right thing.
00:04:26.058,00:04:27.059,"Oh, God."
00:04:29.895,00:04:31.146,I'm gonna miss your boobs.
00:05:01.135,00:05:04.221,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:05:04.263,00:05:05.722,Does this make it work?
00:05:07.933,00:05:10.644,Yes! Yes.
00:05:10.685,00:05:13.438,"There, good. Good."
00:05:13.480,00:05:15.190,"No. No, no."
00:05:19.069,00:05:22.197,"Yes. Yes, yes, good. Oh!"
00:05:23.198,00:05:25.450,MAN: Whoa! Whoa!
00:05:44.845,00:05:48.098,Whoa! Whoa! Oh! Oh! Oh!
00:05:48.140,00:05:49.183,What the hell are you doing here?
00:05:49.224,00:05:50.475,I'm cooking you breakfast!
00:05:50.517,00:05:52.269,"No, okay."
00:05:52.311,00:05:53.603,Right? You need to get out!
00:05:53.645,00:05:55.272,You're in my apartment!
00:05:55.314,00:05:56.773,Put the...
00:05:56.815,00:06:00.527,This is not my apartment.
00:06:00.568,00:06:03.113,Fuck. Sorry.
00:06:03.155,00:06:04.781,I might be a little drunk.
00:06:04.823,00:06:06.365,Oh.
00:06:06.407,00:06:08.243,I might actually wipe my fingerprints off that.
00:06:10.204,00:06:12.039,You were great last night.
00:06:12.080,00:06:13.832,Was I?
00:06:16.168,00:06:18.128,"MEG: Okay, let's go to your happy place."
00:06:18.170,00:06:19.296,What if I poop?
00:06:19.338,00:06:20.755,I won't even notice.
00:06:20.797,00:06:22.507,It's totally natural.
00:06:22.549,00:06:24.968,"Women have been doing this for thousands of years, okay?"
00:06:25.010,00:06:26.220,How many babies have you had?
00:06:27.679,00:06:30.015,"Well, I've delivered about 3,000 of them."
00:06:30.057,00:06:31.058,Didn't you want one?
00:06:32.433,00:06:33.518,You know what?
00:06:33.560,00:06:38.815,I just felt like society doesn't let you pursue your dreams once you have children.
00:06:38.857,00:06:47.824,And I didn't feel like I wanted to give up my identity to be a slave to some tiny little love-terrorist.
00:06:47.866,00:06:53.663,"Plus, your body falls to shit, and you have no time to exercise and forget about sleep for the rest of your life, right?"
00:06:53.705,00:06:56.499,"Oh, no, honey! No, no, no, no, no, no. You can do it!"
00:06:56.541,00:06:57.709,"No, I can't."
00:06:57.751,00:06:59.169,My body went to shit. It did.
00:06:59.211,00:07:01.796,"so loose, already!"
00:07:01.838,00:07:03.798,Let's push!
00:07:03.840,00:07:04.966,MEG: Yay!
00:07:06.801,00:07:09.137,Is that poop or a baby?
00:07:09.179,00:07:11.681,It's not a baby.
00:07:14.601,00:07:17.187,"Robin? This is Alice, our new paralegal."
00:07:17.229,00:07:18.605,"Will you give her the tour, please?"
00:07:18.646,00:07:20.648,"Yes, of course."
00:07:20.690,00:07:22.025,Thank you.
00:07:22.067,00:07:23.277,"Hi, I'm Alice."
00:07:23.318,00:07:24.903,Hi.
00:07:24.945,00:07:27.697,"Yeah. Oh, sorry, my hands are a little bit creamy."
00:07:28.990,00:07:32.202,Okay. All right.
00:07:32.244,00:07:37.040,"Welcome to the law firm of some guy, some other guy, and some Jewish guy."
00:07:37.082,00:07:39.042,Just kidding.
00:07:39.084,00:07:40.543,I'm really excited to be here.
00:07:40.585,00:07:42.503,This was actually one of my top choices.
00:07:42.545,00:07:45.382,"That closet there, is really good for making personal calls."
00:07:45.424,00:07:48.593,"But whatever you do, do not hook up in this copy room."
00:07:48.635,00:07:50.595,"One, it's just, like, so cliche."
00:07:50.637,00:07:52.764,"And two, there's a security camera."
00:07:54.557,00:07:59.062,"Oh, I'm not really hooking up with anybody right now because recently, I actually-- Uh, yeah, I know what you're thinking."
00:07:59.104,00:08:00.855,They do record the footage.
00:08:00.897,00:08:06.069,"So, unless a leaked sex tape is part of your two-year plan, hooking up in the..."
00:08:09.781,00:08:11.950,You'll never know our secrets.
00:08:11.992,00:08:13.743,You'll never know!
00:08:13.785,00:08:14.828,Whoo!
00:08:21.584,00:08:24.004,Excuse me.
00:08:24.045,00:08:26.006,"You're kind of making it my business, here."
00:08:26.047,00:08:28.967,"Look, I just moved in upstairs and my Wi-Fi sucks."
00:08:29.009,00:08:34.264,"So, if I have to listen to every drunk asshole stumble out of here at 5:00 a.m., I'm at least gonna use your free Internet."
00:08:34.306,00:08:36.850,"Wow. Okay, hi. Um..."
00:08:36.891,00:08:38.768,I'm Tom. And-- Hi.
00:08:38.810,00:08:44.691,"If you're gonna be using my free Wi-Fi, at least you can do me a favor and not write shit like, I want to wake up with my best friend."
00:08:44.732,00:08:46.234,Unless you want my dick to fall off.
00:08:46.276,00:08:49.904,"And then maybe we could become best friends, and that'd be awesome."
00:08:49.946,00:08:56.661,"Look, I spent half of last year creating an algorithm that trolls dating apps for the best candidates and downloads them into an Excel spreadsheet."
00:08:56.703,00:08:59.456,"So, I know what I'm looking for."
00:08:59.498,00:09:01.249,"Yeah, that's not weird at all."
00:09:01.291,00:09:02.959,What are you really doing online?
00:09:03.001,00:09:04.627,"I mean, you're a pretty girl."
00:09:04.669,00:09:06.213,This is New York City.
00:09:06.254,00:09:07.588,There's like a billion people outside that door.
00:09:07.630,00:09:09.716,"Yeah, but how many eligible people?"
00:09:09.757,00:09:13.761,"Here. Okay, there are eight million people in this city."
00:09:13.803,00:09:14.971,"Sounds like a lot, right?"
00:09:15.013,00:09:16.056,It does.
00:09:16.097,00:09:17.557,"But, half of them are women."
00:09:17.598,00:09:21.311,"And as hard as I tried in college, I don't swing that way."
00:09:21.353,00:09:22.854,How hard did you try?
00:09:22.896,00:09:24.022,Okay.
00:09:24.064,00:09:25.482,"So, four million men."
00:09:25.524,00:09:26.941,And then you got to have some age limits.
00:09:26.983,00:09:28.651,Let's say over 20.
00:09:28.693,00:09:30.320,Under 40.
00:09:30.362,00:09:31.779,"Now, it's a million."
00:09:31.821,00:09:35.075,Right. We're talking about a million guys.
00:09:35.116,00:09:37.994,But half of them are married.
00:09:38.036,00:09:40.038,10 percent are gay.
00:09:40.080,00:09:41.831,I want someone college educated.
00:09:41.873,00:09:43.958,Not too ugly.
00:09:44.000,00:09:45.168,So...
00:09:45.210,00:09:46.211,There's your boyfriend.
00:09:46.253,00:09:48.171,I wish.
00:09:48.213,00:09:50.757,He's got to be taller than me...
00:09:52.759,00:09:55.053,And he's got to want kids.
00:09:55.095,00:09:58.598,"So, yeah, I'm on 10 different dating websites to increase my odds."
00:09:58.639,00:10:00.225,"So, what do you say?"
00:10:00.267,00:10:04.229,You let me treat this bar like it's my living room and I won't call the cops every night with a noise complaint.
00:10:05.730,00:10:08.233,Okay. Very cute.
00:10:08.275,00:10:09.317,Hmm.
00:10:09.359,00:10:10.360,Thanks.
00:10:11.403,00:10:13.363,Mmm. Mmm.
00:10:13.405,00:10:14.864,See you around.
00:10:14.906,00:10:16.283,Stupid.
00:10:16.324,00:10:17.534,"Um, have a nice night."
00:10:17.576,00:10:19.786,Wait. What?
00:10:19.827,00:10:21.037,I'm going home.
00:10:21.079,00:10:22.456,What?
00:10:22.497,00:10:24.040,I never want to hear you say that again.
00:10:24.082,00:10:25.375,Ugh!
00:10:25.417,00:10:28.920,"You're single now, okay?"
00:10:28.962,00:10:30.255,You shouldn't even have a home.
00:10:30.297,00:10:34.050,You should just have 500 square feet where you keep some clothes and occasionally bathe.
00:10:34.092,00:10:36.886,"Well, okay, technically, I'm not, like, single."
00:10:36.928,00:10:38.721,We're just on a break.
00:10:38.763,00:10:41.308,"Uh, there's no such thing as a break, Season-3 Ross."
00:10:41.349,00:10:42.892,"No, we really are on a break."
00:10:42.934,00:10:46.771,We're just taking a little bit of time apart to make sure we really want to be together.
00:10:46.813,00:10:49.232,"Oh, so you're on some kind of sexual rumspringa?"
00:10:49.274,00:10:51.401,No.
00:10:51.443,00:10:53.069,I could've made you take a half-day!
00:10:53.111,00:10:54.195,It was my first day at work.
00:10:54.237,00:10:55.572,Rumspringa!
00:10:55.614,00:11:00.118,What? No! Where Ask me for a rum and Coke if you think you're gonna die.
00:11:00.160,00:11:01.328,Get out of here!
00:11:01.744,00:11:06.124,"Uh, you said on your profile you're a big dreamer."
00:11:07.667,00:11:10.962,"No, no, I think I want what everybody wants."
00:11:11.004,00:11:13.047,Cross off some things on the bucket list.
00:11:13.089,00:11:15.800,"So, what is on your bucket list?"
00:11:15.842,00:11:16.884,Usual stuff.
00:11:16.926,00:11:18.345,"Uh, Wrigley Fields."
00:11:18.386,00:11:19.762,Dolphin Trainer.
00:11:19.804,00:11:22.098,"Oh, my God. I love dolphins."
00:11:22.140,00:11:23.475,"Loved, since forever."
00:11:23.517,00:11:26.727,"Wow, no, no, you know, because the normal ones are already checked off, you know?"
00:11:26.769,00:11:28.938,Mmm-hmm.
00:11:28.980,00:11:30.148,Dirty Sanchez.
00:11:28.980,00:11:31.899,"Yeah, that's-- Golden Shower. That one, Oh."
00:11:31.941,00:11:33.901,I actually checked off by accident.
00:11:35.278,00:11:38.823,"So, these aren't career goals or life goals."
00:11:38.865,00:11:41.535,These are more sexual things.
00:11:41.576,00:11:43.161,Have you ever heard of the Whack-a-Mole?
00:11:43.203,00:11:44.371,Rum and Coke.
00:11:44.412,00:11:45.997,Rum and Coke? Really?
00:11:46.039,00:11:49.125,I didn't think you'd want to do a Rum and Coke with me on our first date.
00:11:49.167,00:11:50.793,"Um, rum and Coke?"
00:11:50.835,00:11:52.128,"So, I guess I could trap a street rat."
00:11:52.170,00:11:53.547,"I mean, we are in New York."
00:11:53.588,00:11:55.256,Rum and Coke!
00:11:55.298,00:11:56.466,Drink more water.
00:11:56.508,00:11:57.758,Oh. Okay.
00:11:57.800,00:11:58.801,Yo.
00:11:59.844,00:12:01.137,Go lock yourself in my office.
00:12:01.179,00:12:02.430,Thank you.
00:12:03.722,00:12:05.933,Here we go.
00:12:05.975,00:12:09.187,Let me teach you how to be single.
00:12:09.229,00:12:12.357,"Okay, lesson one."
00:12:12.399,00:12:14.150,Okay.
00:12:14.192,00:12:15.985,No. That was a trick.
00:12:16.027,00:12:18.779,You don't buy the drinks.
00:12:18.821,00:12:24.952,"It's kind of like a sexual currency that they use, so they're not actually paying you to hook up."
00:12:24.994,00:12:26.496,"So, go get us a drink."
00:12:26.538,00:12:27.622,Okay.
00:12:27.664,00:12:28.998,Not... Not with this wallet.
00:12:29.040,00:12:30.791,Okay.
00:12:30.833,00:12:31.959,Which of you is buying oil right now?
00:12:32.001,00:12:33.211,Do you know how much...
00:12:33.253,00:12:35.088,"Hey, what's up, y'all?"
00:12:35.129,00:12:36.881,I don't know why I just said y'all.
00:12:36.923,00:12:39.842,You all would have taken just as much time.
00:12:39.884,00:12:43.179,"And I'm not even from the South, I'm from Portland."
00:12:43.221,00:12:46.516,Which is southern from Canada.
00:12:46.558,00:12:47.850,Are y'all Canadian?
00:12:47.892,00:12:50.144,"I just did it again, I said it again."
00:12:50.186,00:12:51.938,My system should have weeded him out.
00:12:51.979,00:12:53.981,You probably read your data wrong.
00:12:54.023,00:12:56.067,I bet that guy told you exactly who he was.
00:12:56.109,00:12:57.444,You just didn't want to hear it.
00:12:57.485,00:12:59.070,I tell the truth to girls all the time.
00:12:59.112,00:13:00.863,They hear what they want to hear.
00:13:00.905,00:13:02.407,That sounds like a load of crap.
00:13:03.824,00:13:06.536,I'm not kidding. Watch this.
00:13:06.578,00:13:07.746,"Hey, sweetheart. Hey."
00:13:07.786,00:13:09.539,Hi.
00:13:09.581,00:13:12.166,"Hey, uh, you know we're only sleeping together for fun, right?"
00:13:12.208,00:13:17.838,"Because I'm not interested in long-term relationships, so I think I'm gonna start seeing other people and I think you should move on, too."
00:13:17.880,00:13:22.552,"Because I care about you, and I don't want to see you get hurt."
00:13:22.594,00:13:25.346,"Oh, I care about you, too."
00:13:25.972,00:13:27.390,Yeah. Hmm.
00:13:31.102,00:13:32.437,Wow.
00:13:32.479,00:13:35.231,You guys are super dressed-up. Funeral?
00:13:36.107,00:13:37.442,"Oh, my God. Okay, bye."
00:13:37.484,00:13:39.026,That was a really bad idea.
00:13:39.068,00:13:41.070,This is stupid. I should probably just go home.
00:13:41.112,00:13:42.196,It's better.
00:13:42.238,00:13:45.866,You have a small window in which to bang your way through New York City.
00:13:45.908,00:13:49.036,"No, Josh and I didn't break up so I could see other people."
00:13:49.078,00:13:51.122,I'm trying to figure out who I am.
00:13:51.164,00:13:56.085,"Then why don't you take this, go home and stare at your beave?"
00:13:56.127,00:13:58.296,"Look, I'm just gonna choose for you. All right?"
00:14:00.381,00:14:03.259,I would like to see your tongue in that bartender's face.
00:14:03.301,00:14:04.636,ALICE: What?
00:14:04.678,00:14:06.304,"ROBIN: Don't worry, I know him."
00:14:06.346,00:14:07.514,He's like a palate cleanser.
00:14:07.555,00:14:08.931,That guy?
00:14:08.973,00:14:10.600,Yeah. I've heard he's really good in bed.
00:14:10.642,00:14:13.186,"From myself, because I might have slept with him."
00:14:13.227,00:14:14.437,I can't really remember.
00:14:14.479,00:14:16.105,"Maybe, uh... It was winter."
00:14:16.147,00:14:18.525,Maybe I just used his dick as a scarf. Let's go.
00:14:18.566,00:14:19.609,What?
00:14:19.651,00:14:21.027,"Hey, Tom."
00:14:21.068,00:14:22.821,This is Alice.
00:14:22.862,00:14:24.531,She's newly single and needs to hook up with a random stranger.
00:14:25.865,00:14:26.991,Let me buy you a drink.
00:14:27.033,00:14:28.284,Thanks.
00:14:29.494,00:14:31.162,Let me buy you a drink.
00:14:32.372,00:14:33.498,Welcome to the party.
00:14:34.499,00:14:35.500,"Umm, cheers."
00:14:38.252,00:14:40.630,Whoo!
00:14:40.672,00:14:42.382,Come on! Yeah! Ha!
00:14:53.184,00:14:54.352,Hi!
00:14:58.147,00:14:59.148,Hey.
00:15:14.539,00:15:17.208,Whoa! Whoa!
00:15:17.250,00:15:19.001,She just hit you in the face!
00:15:20.253,00:15:21.713,Oh!
00:15:34.601,00:15:35.810,"MEG: Morning, sunshine."
00:15:35.852,00:15:36.853,No.
00:15:42.901,00:15:44.485,"Oh, my God."
00:15:44.527,00:15:46.529,Wakey-wakey.
00:15:49.282,00:15:50.867,A doctor?
00:15:50.909,00:15:53.494,Did I have sex with a doctor? Did we have sex?
00:15:54.328,00:15:55.496,No.
00:15:55.538,00:15:57.373,"No, we didn't have sex."
00:15:57.415,00:15:58.499,I didn't sleep with anybody?
00:15:58.541,00:16:00.418,"No, I don't think so."
00:16:00.460,00:16:01.711,Why does it smell like weed in here?
00:16:01.753,00:16:02.879,You have a little...
00:16:02.921,00:16:05.715,What?
00:16:05.757,00:16:08.551,It's just right...
00:16:08.593,00:16:09.803,What?
00:16:09.844,00:16:12.263,"No, I just have long eyelashes."
00:16:12.305,00:16:14.808,It's a...
00:16:14.849,00:16:16.559,Oh.
00:16:16.601,00:16:18.269,Yay! Free coffee!
00:16:21.439,00:16:24.275,"Uh, take two Tylenol, and make yourself some breakfast."
00:16:24.317,00:16:25.693,ALICE: I love you.
00:16:25.735,00:16:28.446,"Love, love you."
00:16:28.488,00:16:31.574,seems pretty cool.
00:16:32.826,00:16:35.411,"Oh, she's my sister."
00:16:35.453,00:16:37.497,Really?
00:16:37.538,00:16:39.874,"Uh, then I think I might have pissed in your sister's litter box."
00:16:41.709,00:16:42.752,That's a Zen garden.
00:16:42.794,00:16:44.545,The cat has a Zen garden?
00:16:44.587,00:16:45.588,ALICE: There's no cat.
00:16:46.506,00:16:47.757,Where am I?
00:16:47.799,00:16:49.801,I knew I had sex in this apartment!
00:16:49.843,00:16:52.386,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:52.428,00:16:54.555,"Okay, where are we?"
00:16:54.597,00:16:57.642,"Um, Broadway and 77th."
00:16:57.684,00:17:00.561,"We have to be at work in 30 minutes, so we should probably go this way."
00:17:00.603,00:17:02.480,"It's okay, I can do this in 20."
00:17:02.522,00:17:03.773,"Wait, do what?"
00:17:03.815,00:17:05.065,"Wait, do what?"
00:17:08.027,00:17:09.403,Step one.
00:17:09.445,00:17:11.280,That stuff is for babies.
00:17:11.322,00:17:12.657,Babies with hangovers.
00:17:19.330,00:17:21.541,"Baba, are we good?"
00:17:23.083,00:17:24.878,Payment accepted. Let's go.
00:17:49.068,00:17:50.319,Hi!
00:17:50.361,00:17:51.905,"Yeah, hi."
00:17:50.361,00:17:59.328,"I'm really interested in buying a lot of your products, but first, I need you to put all of them on my face, in a very nice way, for free."
00:17:59.370,00:18:01.789,"I'm gonna need a full face, with a side of Wow."
00:18:01.831,00:18:02.832,Okay.
00:18:05.543,00:18:07.127,"Mimosa, hold the orange juice."
00:18:08.379,00:18:10.965,Here. Come on. Gimme.
00:18:22.560,00:18:23.853,Nailed it.
00:18:23.895,00:18:25.688,You're three-and-a-half hours late.
00:18:25.730,00:18:27.732,MEG: Yay! Lunchtime!
00:18:29.734,00:18:31.360,And don't worry about the weight.
00:18:31.402,00:18:33.071,It should come off after you stop nursing the infant.
00:18:33.112,00:18:34.989,Katie. That's her name.
00:18:35.031,00:18:36.323,"Oh, okay."
00:18:36.365,00:18:37.867,"Oh, no. I have to pee."
00:18:37.909,00:18:39.619,It just falls out of me these days.
00:18:39.660,00:18:40.703,Can you hold...
00:18:40.745,00:18:42.705,I'm not good with babies.
00:18:43.915,00:18:47.126,Hello. How are you today?
00:18:47.167,00:18:50.463,Your mom should be coming back soon.
00:18:50.504,00:18:53.007,"Is, um, Katie short for Katherine?"
00:18:54.634,00:18:59.513,"See, some women would look at what you just did and think that you smiled."
00:18:59.555,00:19:05.812,"But, because I'm a doctor, I know that that was probably just an involuntary tic, or gas."
00:19:07.438,00:19:08.689,You know what?
00:19:08.731,00:19:12.777,"You're not that cute, and I am not falling for it."
00:19:12.819,00:19:16.155,"So, you just keep trying, but it is no."
00:19:19.450,00:19:20.910,"Shut up, baby."
00:19:20.952,00:19:22.662,"And, you know what?"
00:19:20.952,00:19:24.413,"Don't touch that, because that's not very sanitary."
00:19:26.040,00:19:32.546,"Germs are little bugs, like little microbes that get into your mouth, and they make you sick."
00:19:33.714,00:19:35.549,"So, you eat your shoe."
00:19:39.219,00:19:42.431,You are not winning me over.
00:19:42.473,00:19:44.600,Why do you put everything in your mouth?
00:19:44.642,00:19:47.937,Hello. Hi.
00:19:59.281,00:20:06.622,"MEG: And so we're clear, there are a lot of people in this world who need things like you in their lives, to feel complete."
00:20:06.664,00:20:10.960,I am not one of them.
00:20:24.932,00:20:26.600,Fine. You win.
00:20:38.654,00:20:42.658,"If Tom texts you, which he won't, because it's still daylight, wait four hours to respond."
00:20:42.700,00:20:44.827,thinking about Tom.
00:20:44.869,00:20:50.208,"Anything sooner implies that you're needy and really co-dependent and incapable of a simple hookup, which is all he's good for."
00:20:50.249,00:20:53.669,"I think that I could actually be, like, a good-- And, when you respond, do not respond in full sentences."
00:20:53.711,00:20:55.129,Okay.
00:20:55.171,00:20:56.923,"And if you use an emoji, I will fucking tit-punch you."
00:20:56.964,00:20:58.132,Fine.
00:20:58.174,00:20:59.175,Fine.
00:21:12.605,00:21:14.523,You can have this back at the end of the day.
00:21:14.565,00:21:15.733,Fine.
00:21:15.775,00:21:17.068,An emoji?
00:21:17.110,00:21:20.696,"oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
00:21:23.282,00:21:25.118,This is so dumb.
00:21:25.159,00:21:26.786,It's not like I don't know you're bad for me.
00:21:26.827,00:21:28.328,Sure.
00:21:28.370,00:21:31.082,"And I'm not gonna be one of those cliched girls who thinks I can, like, change you, or something."
00:21:31.124,00:21:32.041,"No, you can't."
00:21:42.342,00:21:45.179,Sex? It's the best way to find out what you want.
00:21:45.221,00:21:49.558,"Think about it, the whole love thing, the whole, I just want a guy to notice when I'm cold."
00:21:49.600,00:21:53.146,It's nice when a guy notices when you're cold.
00:21:50.893,00:21:55.982,"It means he's-- It means he's faking it, because he knows that's what you want to hear."
00:21:56.023,00:22:01.195,"So, instead of being a psycho who pretends that I give a shit if you're cold, I tell everyone the same thing."
00:22:01.237,00:22:03.948,"If you're looking for the one, that's not me."
00:22:03.990,00:22:07.660,"If you're looking for the one to have a little fun with, I'm that one."
00:22:08.286,00:22:09.578,Oh.
00:22:10.871,00:22:12.123,Whew!
00:22:12.165,00:22:14.917,I've always been in relationships.
00:22:14.959,00:22:19.213,"But, I guess that's just because I actually don't really know how to stay single."
00:22:19.255,00:22:21.174,Then you came to the right place.
00:22:21.215,00:22:24.593,"The trick is to love them, but get them to leave you."
00:22:24.635,00:22:25.761,"That way, nobody gets hurt."
00:22:25.803,00:22:27.263,Check this out.
00:22:27.305,00:22:28.681,What do all these things have in common? Go.
00:22:30.141,00:22:32.268,"Um, ketchup and beer."
00:22:32.310,00:22:34.352,"Pickles, chocolate sauce."
00:22:34.394,00:22:35.771,Are you pregnant?
00:22:35.813,00:22:38.191,"No, they can't be used to make breakfast."
00:22:38.232,00:22:41.110,"There's no reason to stick around in the morning, because you can't make an omelet."
00:22:41.152,00:22:43.904,"Plus, no water."
00:22:41.152,00:22:45.614,"So, hungover chicks, you got to leave to survive."
00:22:45.656,00:22:48.826,Except for that New York water is delicious and you can just drink it from the tap.
00:22:48.868,00:22:51.245,"Yeah. But, uh..."
00:22:51.287,00:22:54.707,From what glass?
00:22:54.748,00:22:55.958,Wow.
00:22:56.000,00:22:57.043,You're a piece of work.
00:22:57.084,00:22:58.085,Mmm-hmm.
00:23:01.672,00:23:03.341,Glass.
00:23:03.381,00:23:06.093,"Okay, MacGyver, no woman's gotten this far, but, um..."
00:23:09.930,00:23:11.389,You had a plumber cut your water?
00:23:11.431,00:23:13.642,No. I did it myself.
00:23:13.684,00:23:14.852,What if you need to wash your hands?
00:23:14.894,00:23:16.229,"What am I, a surgeon?"
00:23:16.270,00:23:18.064,What if you get thirsty?
00:23:20.691,00:23:22.235,Nice. Well done.
00:23:22.276,00:23:23.819,"Totally thought it was a nightstand, didn't you?"
00:23:23.861,00:23:25.363,You're a psycho.
00:23:25.403,00:23:27.156,I'm not a psycho.
00:23:25.403,00:23:28.866,"Look, most guys are like me, they're just not honest about it."
00:23:28.908,00:23:32.995,"I'm telling you, this is what it's like out there."
00:23:33.037,00:23:34.372,Why are you telling me this?
00:23:35.915,00:23:37.166,I don't know.
00:23:37.208,00:23:41.003,"It's just, you're different."
00:23:45.258,00:23:47.176,"Oh, my God. That's the thing you say to girls."
00:23:47.218,00:23:48.426,"Yes, it is."
00:23:48.468,00:23:49.511,Completely.
00:23:49.553,00:23:51.138,"Anyway, end of the tour."
00:23:51.180,00:23:53.807,"And, um, this was fun."
00:23:57.937,00:23:59.939,See you.
00:24:23.212,00:24:24.797,Hi.
00:24:33.097,00:24:34.848,"Uh, mimosa?"
00:24:34.890,00:24:37.726,"Uh, no, I'm actually on my way to a meeting."
00:24:37.768,00:24:41.105,"So, I'm probably not gonna start drinking at 8:30 on a Thursday."
00:24:41.147,00:24:45.276,"Yeah, no, I didn't..."
00:24:45.318,00:24:49.029,"Um, I got us chocolate chip pancakes for the table, like we used to."
00:24:49.071,00:24:55.077,"have a lot of time, so-- Okay, no, then I'll just get right to it."
00:24:56.203,00:24:59.248,"I'm done. I'm, I'm finally done."
00:25:00.958,00:25:02.751,What? What are you done with?
00:25:02.793,00:25:04.044,With our time apart.
00:25:04.086,00:25:05.421,I know it's been really difficult.
00:25:05.463,00:25:07.006,It's been difficult on both of us.
00:25:07.047,00:25:10.884,"But, I'm finally ready for us to be together."
00:25:10.926,00:25:13.137,And I'll never have to wonder about anything else.
00:25:14.347,00:25:15.348,I'm seeing someone.
00:25:18.976,00:25:21.187,That is...
00:25:22.813,00:25:24.148,ALICE: Um...
00:25:24.190,00:25:28.319,"So, then, so, Josh, you want to just, like, tell me when you're done, then?"
00:25:28.361,00:25:30.112,"I don't know, Alice."
00:25:30.154,00:25:32.823,"Like, we can... We'll just wait till you're done."
00:25:32.865,00:25:34.325,"Shit's different, I'm not..."
00:25:34.367,00:25:37.786,I'm not sure I want the same things anymore.
00:25:41.999,00:25:44.460,"You mean, like, me?"
00:25:46.420,00:25:48.881,I didn't need an experiment to know that I loved you.
00:25:51.091,00:25:52.759,And I'm not an idiot.
00:25:52.801,00:26:01.018,"You're, I guess, done with whatever you've been doing, with whoever you've been doing, and you can come running back to me?"
00:26:01.060,00:26:03.896,"No, thanks. I'll pass."
00:26:07.066,00:26:08.317,WAITER: Who ordered pancakes?
00:26:11.028,00:26:13.489,"ALICE: Meg, I'm not ready to be alone. I'm not."
00:26:13.531,00:26:15.366,I don't know how to reset my router.
00:26:15.408,00:26:16.950,I don't even know where it is.
00:26:16.992,00:26:19.328,"I don't even really know what, exactly, it does."
00:26:19.370,00:26:21.330,I'm gonna be alone forever.
00:26:21.372,00:26:25.876,my dead body will serve as food for my cats.
00:26:25.918,00:26:30.256,"In the eight weeks that it takes for anybody to find me, because nobody gives a fuck."
00:26:30.297,00:26:32.508,Why are you watching Bridget Jones?
00:26:32.550,00:26:33.967,What did I tell you?
00:26:34.009,00:26:35.261,It feels good in the moment.
00:26:35.302,00:26:38.013,"I know, but it's a bad idea."
00:26:38.055,00:26:45.521,You get yourself all hopped up on Sex and the City and Bridget Jones and thinking that you need to have some big single experience.
00:26:45.563,00:26:47.647,"Which, by the way, is total bullshit."
00:26:47.689,00:26:51.318,No.
00:26:51.360,00:26:54.612,"And this is a great thing, because now you can focus on your career."
00:26:54.654,00:26:59.034,"What? No! I put myself out, into the world, and it completely rejected me."
00:26:59.076,00:27:00.536,Whoa!
00:27:00.578,00:27:03.414,"Okay, you haven't been single for that long!"
00:27:03.456,00:27:04.664,Yeah.
00:27:04.706,00:27:08.085,"You got to go around the board, pass Go, collect 200 dicks."
00:27:08.127,00:27:13.466,MEG: And you remember the best thing that ever happened to me was when I was thinking about quitting medical school.
00:27:13.507,00:27:15.384,Please don't tell the medical school story.
00:27:15.426,00:27:23.350,"And then, my piece of shit boyfriend, Bobby, cheated on me with my lab partner, because she was willing to do things that I wasn't."
00:27:23.392,00:27:24.560,Did it involve midgets?
00:27:25.603,00:27:26.604,No.
00:27:28.147,00:27:30.232,I once slept with an albino.
00:27:30.274,00:27:36.363,"Anyway, the good news is, now there are BOTH: 3,000 beautiful babies in the world and no one can take that away..."
00:27:36.405,00:27:37.948,...from me.
00:27:36.405,00:27:39.492,...from her Why don't you go to one of those alumni events?
00:27:39.533,00:27:40.658,An alumni event?
00:27:40.700,00:27:49.460,"You go, and you network with people and if you really love what you do then the whole guy thing is easier."
00:27:49.502,00:27:51.920,"No! I don't want to be like you, Meg."
00:27:51.962,00:27:54.507,I don't want my job to be my entire life.
00:27:54.548,00:27:55.591,ROBIN: Ooh.
00:27:55.633,00:27:58.927,"Okay. Sisters, time-out."
00:27:58.969,00:28:02.473,"There are pros and cons to both of you, okay?"
00:28:02.515,00:28:05.267,"Pros. Young, beautiful."
00:28:05.309,00:28:08.270,"Pros. Also beautiful, for your age."
00:28:08.312,00:28:10.606,Rich. Doctor. Access to pills.
00:28:10.648,00:28:12.566,Cons. No access to pills.
00:28:12.608,00:28:14.652,Cons. You're really stingy with the pills.
00:28:14.692,00:28:15.944,Right.
00:28:15.986,00:28:17.363,Pros.
00:28:17.404,00:28:19.281,Gives me the spare key to the apartment.
00:28:19.323,00:28:20.616,Has a very nice underwear drawer.
00:28:20.658,00:28:22.159,Very neat and organized.
00:28:22.201,00:28:23.494,You have a key to my apartment?
00:28:23.536,00:28:26.246,Cons. Asks too many personal questions.
00:28:26.288,00:28:31.293,"Okay. I'm gonna take my old, lonely, workaholic ass back to the hospital."
00:28:34.505,00:28:37.216,Cons. Ugly when sad.
00:28:44.598,00:28:47.226,"Hey, uh, did you bring a sandwich from home?"
00:28:47.267,00:28:48.519,Mmm.
00:28:48.561,00:28:50.563,Are you wearing pajamas in a bar?
00:28:50.604,00:28:51.771,They're sweatpants.
00:28:51.813,00:28:53.607,I think you're bumming some people out.
00:28:53.649,00:28:55.192,You might want to take your give up pants and go home.
00:28:55.234,00:28:56.318,Leave me alone.
00:29:02.324,00:29:03.409,BRITTANY: Lucy?
00:29:03.450,00:29:04.451,Hi!
00:29:05.244,00:29:06.579,"Oh, my God!"
00:29:06.620,00:29:08.414,Brittany! Hi!
00:29:08.455,00:29:10.082,How are you?
00:29:10.123,00:29:11.375,I'm getting married!
00:29:11.417,00:29:13.085,She's getting married!
00:29:13.126,00:29:16.422,That is just the best news I've ever heard in my entire life!
00:29:16.463,00:29:17.673,"Oh, yay!"
00:29:17.715,00:29:19.216,How old are your kids?
00:29:21.218,00:29:24.680,I don't have any.
00:29:24.722,00:29:26.348,"But not in, like, a sad way."
00:29:26.390,00:29:28.726,It's more like a volunteer thing?
00:29:28.767,00:29:30.185,ALL: Oh. Oh.
00:29:30.227,00:29:31.687,Yeah. Yeah.
00:29:31.729,00:29:33.188,"So, are you married?"
00:29:34.690,00:29:35.691,Dating anyone?
00:29:35.733,00:29:37.192,"Uh, afraid not."
00:29:37.234,00:29:38.611,Are you divorced?
00:29:38.652,00:29:41.530,ever loved me enough to eventually divorce me.
00:29:43.282,00:29:45.451,"You got to get in the game, before you can lose, so..."
00:29:45.492,00:29:48.537,"I'm not even a good loser, yet."
00:29:49.788,00:29:51.540,"Oh, my God, are those penis straws?"
00:29:51.582,00:29:53.792,You guys are gonna have a crazy night tonight!
00:29:53.833,00:29:54.834,Hi.
00:29:55.628,00:29:56.629,Oh.
00:30:03.594,00:30:04.678,"Hey, baby."
00:30:06.263,00:30:07.598,"This is, um..."
00:30:07.640,00:30:09.224,"It's all right, you can say it."
00:30:09.266,00:30:10.809,"Miss Independent right here, right?"
00:30:10.850,00:30:12.060,I'm her boyfriend.
00:30:12.102,00:30:13.729,ALL: Oh!
00:30:13.771,00:30:15.439,LUCY: This is my boyfriend.
00:30:15.481,00:30:17.775,"God, doesn't she look smoking hot in these sweatpants?"
00:30:17.816,00:30:20.110,"Oh, wow, that's so sweet."
00:30:20.152,00:30:22.279,"This is Brittany. She's getting married, obviously."
00:30:22.321,00:30:24.406,"Oh, you're the one getting married. Marriage!"
00:30:26.074,00:30:30.579,"The end of spontaneous sex, traveling by yourself and buying whatever you want without having to ask permission, right?"
00:30:33.999,00:30:36.752,"Congratulations, good luck with it. I hope it lasts."
00:30:37.586,00:30:39.630,Sorry. No filter.
00:31:01.485,00:31:04.196,"Hey, listen. I hope, uh, that kiss wasn't too much."
00:31:04.237,00:31:06.740,"Oh, my God."
00:31:06.782,00:31:09.702,Thank you so much! Good night.
00:31:45.696,00:31:46.697,Oh.
00:31:58.792,00:32:00.960,you fucking bitch.
00:32:01.961,00:32:04.381,Hey.
00:32:04.423,00:32:06.842,Sorry. Was that supposed to be a private moment?
00:32:06.884,00:32:08.468,I can't get my zipper.
00:32:10.888,00:32:12.389,I'm sorry for what I said to you.
00:32:12.431,00:32:13.849,What?
00:32:13.891,00:32:14.808,"I said, I'm sorry for what I said to you."
00:32:14.850,00:32:15.851,Can't hear you.
00:32:17.519,00:32:26.528,I said I'm sorry for what What?
00:32:26.570,00:32:28.572,I'm gonna have a baby.
00:32:28.614,00:32:30.490,What?
00:32:30.532,00:32:32.701,This guy.
00:32:32.743,00:32:34.453,"Oh, my God."
00:32:32.743,00:32:39.499,"He has no known cancers on either side of his family, no history of drug abuse, no history of any kind of mental illness, or..."
00:32:39.541,00:32:40.918,"Oh, my God."
00:32:40.959,00:32:42.753,"Oh, my God."
00:32:44.337,00:32:46.214,I know.
00:32:46.256,00:32:47.716,Wait. Do you think it's a bad idea?
00:32:47.758,00:32:49.468,"Why are you saying Oh, my God five times?"
00:32:49.509,00:32:51.219,"No, but... Wait, when do you meet him?"
00:32:51.261,00:32:53.096,That's the best part.
00:32:53.138,00:32:55.641,"I never, ever have to meet him, or any of his family."
00:32:55.682,00:32:57.684,There's no strings attached at all.
00:32:57.726,00:32:59.394,Nothing. Is that crazy?
00:32:59.436,00:33:01.980,"No. Oh, my God, you're gonna have a baby."
00:33:02.021,00:33:04.566,I know!
00:33:04.608,00:33:06.568,I'm so happy for you.
00:33:06.610,00:33:08.570,You'll always be my baby first.
00:33:09.696,00:33:12.825,But you do need to grow up.
00:33:12.866,00:33:14.701,And you do need to move out by this Friday.
00:33:14.743,00:33:15.953,What?
00:33:15.994,00:33:17.579,The co-op board found out you were here.
00:33:17.621,00:33:19.623,Is this a bad idea?
00:33:19.665,00:33:21.834,"No, you're gonna be the best mom in the world."
00:33:21.875,00:33:23.836,Wait. Just go back.
00:33:23.877,00:33:25.754,What was that thing that you just said about the co-op board?
00:33:25.796,00:33:27.005,You need to be out by Friday.
00:33:28.548,00:33:30.258,But you're allowed to have guests.
00:33:30.300,00:33:34.012,"Yes. But my guests aren't allowed to slide down the trash chute, naked."
00:33:34.053,00:33:35.973,I didn't go naked down the...
00:33:38.809,00:33:39.810,Robin did that.
00:33:39.852,00:33:41.269,Mmm-hmm.
00:33:41.311,00:33:43.647,I've seen security footage. And it just...
00:33:43.689,00:33:44.940,Hmm.
00:34:04.001,00:34:05.627,I don't know.
00:34:05.669,00:34:08.881,"Hmm, it seems kind of homey, like you'd actually want to spend time here."
00:34:10.340,00:34:12.425,"Oh, this could be a reading window."
00:34:12.467,00:34:14.427,Reading is for ugly losers.
00:34:14.469,00:34:15.971,I really like it.
00:34:16.013,00:34:17.723,"Yeah, but, I mean... Oh!"
00:34:17.764,00:34:18.974,BROKER: Wait!
00:34:19.016,00:34:20.976,That just...
00:34:21.018,00:34:22.435,I think I'm gonna take it.
00:34:22.477,00:34:23.812,ROBIN: This place is dangerous.
00:34:25.522,00:34:26.773,Don't let that... Don't...
00:34:28.775,00:34:31.444,Did that just break?
00:35:37.970,00:35:39.429,That was weird.
00:35:42.307,00:35:43.558,Maybe you should just leave it in there.
00:35:43.600,00:35:45.060,Maybe you shouldn't shake it like that.
00:35:45.102,00:35:46.895,"What, it's gonna make the pee go in there."
00:35:46.937,00:35:49.230,"No, it doesn't work like that."
00:35:49.272,00:35:51.232,"I'm gonna be the best auntie, ever. I am."
00:35:51.274,00:35:52.985,I'm gonna give that kid whatever it wants.
00:35:53.026,00:35:54.569,Forever.
00:35:54.611,00:35:56.113,"Don't get your hopes up, okay?"
00:35:56.154,00:35:57.990,Because it never works on the first time.
00:35:58.031,00:35:59.240,It's too late.
00:36:03.453,00:36:04.621,Mmm.
00:36:04.663,00:36:07.457,See? I told you.
00:36:07.499,00:36:08.959,Are you okay?
00:36:09.001,00:36:11.377,"Oh, no, it always..."
00:36:11.419,00:36:14.380,"It doesn't usually work on the first time, like I said."
00:36:14.422,00:36:15.757,What?
00:36:20.137,00:36:22.973,I deal with this kind of thing all the time. You know that.
00:36:24.766,00:36:26.392,Are you drinking enough water?
00:36:26.434,00:36:28.478,"Your lips are really dry, which means you're dehydrated."
00:36:29.604,00:36:31.314,I'll go get you some water.
00:36:38.697,00:36:41.282,"These plums are available through late summer, early autumn."
00:36:41.324,00:36:42.367,JOSH: Alice!
00:36:42.408,00:36:45.203,"And they're just wonderful, they're called Italian prune plums."
00:36:47.497,00:36:51.501,"So, we're gonna make a bit of caramel with a cup of sugar, and a third of a cup of water."
00:36:51.543,00:36:55.047,I'm just gonna cook it over medium heat until it's nice and caramelized and brown...
00:36:55.088,00:36:56.131,JOSH: Alice!
00:37:00.135,00:37:01.636,Hi.
00:37:01.678,00:37:03.304,My buzzer's broken.
00:37:03.346,00:37:05.640,It's like if Romeo and Juliet had lived in New York.
00:37:05.682,00:37:07.726,That was bad. Can I come up?
00:37:07.767,00:37:09.561,Yeah.
00:37:16.609,00:37:18.695,make this cake another time...
00:37:33.043,00:37:34.127,Hey.
00:37:34.169,00:37:35.420,Hey.
00:37:35.461,00:37:36.671,It's good to see you.
00:37:36.713,00:37:39.758,So good to see you. What's up?
00:37:39.799,00:37:45.097,"Well, I was going through my closet, and I found a bunch of your old stuff, so I thought you might want it."
00:37:49.392,00:37:52.353,I could've come by to get this.
00:37:52.395,00:37:58.401,"Well, actually, that's the thing, is, um, that's part of why I wanted to come over."
00:37:58.443,00:38:00.112,Uh...
00:38:00.153,00:38:03.782,"So, Michelle is moving in tomorrow."
00:38:04.741,00:38:07.410,So...
00:38:08.578,00:38:11.289,Michelle.
00:38:11.330,00:38:12.498,She's got a name and everything.
00:38:12.540,00:38:13.959,She's got a name.
00:38:14.000,00:38:15.210,"Well, technically, she's always had a name."
00:38:15.252,00:38:16.711,Mmm-hmm.
00:38:15.252,00:38:19.672,"I mean, her lease was up and I was with this craigslist guy, and he started stealing my socks."
00:38:19.714,00:38:21.049,Mmm-hmm.
00:38:21.091,00:38:22.717,It makes sense.
00:38:22.759,00:38:25.178,Mmm-hmm. We are.
00:38:25.220,00:38:26.263,So...
00:38:26.304,00:38:28.223,So let me give you the tour.
00:38:28.265,00:38:31.226,"Um, this is the kitchen."
00:38:31.268,00:38:36.397,This is the living room workspace-bedroom region.
00:38:36.439,00:38:39.442,And are you working on your Spanish?
00:38:39.484,00:38:42.445,"Oh, that's been that way since I moved in, and I don't know how to fix it."
00:38:42.487,00:38:45.782,And now I don't know what the world would be like if it wasn't in Spanish.
00:38:50.369,00:38:51.746,"It's pretty easy, you know, it's..."
00:39:05.635,00:39:06.845,Alice.
00:39:06.886,00:39:08.763,Michelle is a really lucky girl.
00:39:11.599,00:39:13.685,I didn't expect for this to happen.
00:39:14.686,00:39:15.687,I just...
00:39:17.730,00:39:22.777,I stopped comparing everyone to you and then I met someone pretty great.
00:39:24.445,00:39:25.947,I'm super happy for you.
00:39:27.365,00:39:28.491,"Yeah, I can see that."
00:39:29.868,00:39:33.872,Alice. All right.
00:39:33.913,00:39:35.581,I'm gonna go.
00:39:51.430,00:39:53.183,You need to move on.
00:39:55.352,00:39:56.519,Fine.
00:39:57.770,00:39:59.731,"Uh, no going backwards, only forwards."
00:39:59.772,00:40:01.482,You can't sleep with Tom again.
00:40:01.524,00:40:05.320,"Well, then, we're gonna have to start going to a different bar, girlfriend."
00:40:05.362,00:40:09.615,"No, you'll be fine, just don't hit your drink number with him."
00:40:09.657,00:40:11.659,What's my drink number?
00:40:11.701,00:40:18.499,"In every male-female friendship, there's a total number of drinks and if you hit that, it means you will definitely have sex."
00:40:18.541,00:40:20.543,"So, how many drinks does it take to get you wasted?"
00:40:20.585,00:40:22.754,"Two and a half, but maybe three, if I've eaten."
00:40:22.795,00:40:23.880,Three.
00:40:23.922,00:40:25.840,"Okay, and Tom's is eight."
00:40:25.882,00:40:28.718,"So, you can't hit eleven drinks between the two of you."
00:40:28.760,00:40:31.263,Okay.
00:40:31.304,00:40:33.306,"Not six for him, five for you."
00:40:33.348,00:40:35.850,"If I had more than five drinks, I'd hook up with you."
00:40:35.892,00:40:37.643,My drink number is 27.
00:40:37.685,00:40:39.187,What?
00:40:39.229,00:40:41.356,I wouldn't even touch myself on less than 24.
00:40:41.398,00:40:42.399,That's...
00:40:43.482,00:40:45.443,What are you doing? Stop.
00:40:45.484,00:40:47.237,What is that?
00:40:50.240,00:40:52.325,"Oh, my God."
00:40:52.367,00:40:53.701,I thought that was gonna be boiling hot.
00:40:53.743,00:40:54.786,You have LTRP.
00:40:54.827,00:40:55.870,"Oh, my God. I do?"
00:40:55.912,00:40:57.122,Yeah.
00:40:57.163,00:40:58.957,Tom gave it to me. For sure.
00:40:58.998,00:41:00.417,Wait. What's LTRP?
00:41:00.458,00:41:01.876,Long-Term Relationship Pussy.
00:41:01.918,00:41:03.753,You really need to get that taken care of.
00:41:03.795,00:41:05.797,What do you mean?
00:41:05.838,00:41:09.384,It's like you dropped your hairbrush and your vagina caught it.
00:41:09.426,00:41:11.719,I could make dreadlocks with that bush and form a reggae band.
00:41:11.761,00:41:14.347,That looks like a whole bowl of petrified curly fries.
00:41:14.389,00:41:17.392,It's like Gandalf is staring right at me.
00:41:17.434,00:41:20.186,No penis shall pass!
00:41:20.228,00:41:22.772,You've ruined so many things for me.
00:41:40.915,00:41:42.000,Hi.
00:41:42.041,00:41:44.502,Hi. What are you here for?
00:41:44.543,00:41:49.257,"Um, I am here to finally put myself out there."
00:41:49.299,00:41:52.427,"Like, in a real way. You know?"
00:41:52.469,00:41:55.430,"Not just physically, but, like, emotionally."
00:41:55.472,00:41:57.015,Yeah.
00:41:57.056,00:41:59.684,"Uh, no, I was asking what event are you here for?"
00:41:59.725,00:42:01.019,"Oh, um..."
00:42:01.686,00:42:03.021,"Oh, my God."
00:42:03.062,00:42:05.064,The Wesleyan Alumni Networking Event.
00:42:05.106,00:42:06.232,Cool.
00:42:17.327,00:42:18.411,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:42:18.453,00:42:19.787,"Sorry, sorry."
00:42:19.829,00:42:21.622,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
00:42:21.664,00:42:23.166,"Oh, my God, we're..."
00:42:42.601,00:42:45.480,"Hey. Get back over there, you're screwing up the harmonies."
00:42:47.106,00:42:48.816,"I'm David Stone, nice to meet you."
00:42:48.858,00:42:50.402,"Hi. Hey, I'm Alice."
00:42:50.443,00:42:51.610,Alice...
00:42:51.652,00:42:52.987,Kepley.
00:42:53.029,00:42:54.989,It's not as good as Stone.
00:42:55.031,00:42:56.866,Do you want one of my business cards?
00:42:56.908,00:42:59.536,"Or maybe 400 of them, so you could tile your bathroom?"
00:42:59.577,00:43:00.619,"Well, what's on them?"
00:43:00.661,00:43:05.624,"Um, my Social Security Number, my mom's maiden name, my ATM PIN."
00:43:05.666,00:43:06.667,"That's what goes on these, right?"
00:43:06.709,00:43:07.793,"Absolutely, the essentials."
00:43:08.920,00:43:10.255,What do you do?
00:43:10.296,00:43:11.756,"Um, I'm a paralegal."
00:43:11.797,00:43:14.509,Okay.
00:43:14.551,00:43:17.011,"Is that, uh, 144 Wall Street?"
00:43:17.053,00:43:18.721,"Yeah, I have the building right next door."
00:43:18.763,00:43:20.348,You have the building?
00:43:20.390,00:43:22.934,"Like, in a Fantasy Building League?"
00:43:22.975,00:43:26.896,"Uh, no. Um, I don't have the building, I kind of own it."
00:43:26.938,00:43:28.523,There's no way to make that sound right.
00:43:28.565,00:43:30.525,"I'm a developer, so, it's not just me."
00:43:30.567,00:43:32.569,"It's like a group of people, but..."
00:43:32.610,00:43:35.154,"That's like a real-ass job, man."
00:43:37.782,00:43:39.200,"Oh, your team."
00:43:39.242,00:43:40.743,We really need to work on our repertoire.
00:43:40.785,00:43:42.745,Are you kidding me?
00:43:42.787,00:43:46.707,"Yeah, this is like my top 13th favorite song of all time."
00:43:49.502,00:43:50.920,"Oh, I'm sorry, it's my daughter."
00:43:50.962,00:43:52.547,"Oh, yeah, no, totally. Me, too."
00:43:52.589,00:43:55.049,"I mean, I'm a..."
00:43:55.091,00:43:56.801,It was great to meet you.
00:43:56.842,00:43:58.553,Bye. Yeah.
00:44:05.101,00:44:06.769,"MEG: Okay, 30 more seconds."
00:44:07.686,00:44:09.147,Twenty-seven.
00:44:09.188,00:44:12.484,"It said three to 10 minutes, is that right?"
00:44:12.525,00:44:13.901,I'm doing this in solidarity.
00:44:13.943,00:44:16.737,Guys. Mine's positive.
00:44:17.822,00:44:19.115,What?
00:44:19.865,00:44:21.742,Wait.
00:44:21.784,00:44:23.911,I'm taking a drug test.
00:44:23.953,00:44:25.163,No.
00:44:33.921,00:44:34.964,I'm...
00:44:35.006,00:44:36.549,You're pregnant.
00:44:36.591,00:44:38.176,I'm pregnant.
00:44:38.217,00:44:40.719,"It's all right, don't worry."
00:44:41.638,00:44:43.931,"I mean, Yes!"
00:44:43.973,00:44:46.058,ALICE: You're pregnant!
00:44:46.100,00:44:47.644,We're pregnant!
00:44:47.685,00:44:48.978,I'm not pregnant!
00:44:49.020,00:44:50.729,I'm on drugs!
00:45:15.046,00:45:17.840,I found my peanut!
00:45:17.882,00:45:18.966,Hey.
00:45:19.008,00:45:20.176,He has so many teeth.
00:45:28.643,00:45:32.813,"What up, office fools?"
00:45:32.855,00:45:37.151,Who's ready to reach into my cleave of wonders and win themselves a prize?
00:45:37.193,00:45:39.736,"Doris, I'm coming to you first, baby."
00:45:42.198,00:45:45.660,Whoa! It is a hole-puncher!
00:45:45.702,00:45:48.246,You have won Kathy's credit card.
00:45:48.287,00:45:49.664,"Let's go, dance circle!"
00:45:49.706,00:45:52.166,"Bridget, come on in here, you slut!"
00:45:55.044,00:45:58.089,How many sliders does it take to equal a whole burger?
00:45:59.048,00:46:01.008,What?
00:46:01.050,00:46:03.553,How many little burgers does it take to make a whole burger?
00:46:05.888,00:46:07.098,Don't call me crazy.
00:46:07.139,00:46:09.308,Don't ever call a pregnant woman crazy.
00:46:09.350,00:46:11.060,Okay. All right.
00:46:11.102,00:46:12.645,Okay.
00:46:12.687,00:46:14.564,How many little meats make up a whole big meat?
00:46:14.606,00:46:16.232,"I don't know, maybe four?"
00:46:18.276,00:46:19.527,I've had seven.
00:46:19.569,00:46:20.986,Eight. I meant eight.
00:46:21.028,00:46:22.405,"Is it four, or is it eight?"
00:46:22.447,00:46:24.865,"It's eight, or more."
00:46:24.907,00:46:25.991,Who told you that?
00:46:26.033,00:46:27.159,The slider guy.
00:46:29.328,00:46:32.081,"Please blink, so I know you're in there."
00:46:32.123,00:46:33.541,I'm sorry.
00:46:33.583,00:46:40.047,I just have blood pumping through my body in an uncomfortable way and it feels like it's all accumulating right here.
00:46:40.089,00:46:42.341,Don't touch yourself like that in my workplace.
00:46:42.383,00:46:43.593,I need a man.
00:46:43.635,00:46:45.136,A man?
00:46:45.177,00:46:46.679,I don't know...
00:46:46.721,00:46:48.598,"It's, like, the hormones or something."
00:46:48.640,00:46:53.144,"Actually, the new guy has sort of been checking you out."
00:46:53.185,00:46:54.228,Which one?
00:46:59.024,00:47:00.109,Did you get it?
00:47:00.151,00:47:01.986,All right. He's like...
00:47:03.862,00:47:05.156,Right over there.
00:47:07.950,00:47:09.786,No. No.
00:47:09.826,00:47:11.828,Because he's too young.
00:47:11.870,00:47:13.956,All young guys want to do is have sex all day.
00:47:13.998,00:47:20.254,"All I need is just a quick 10 minutes, and then a really long nap."
00:47:20.296,00:47:22.131,"How old is that little niblet, anyway?"
00:47:22.173,00:47:25.635,"Like, twenty-f... Seven?"
00:47:25.677,00:47:29.305,The only reason a guy like that would ever talk to me is to get a prescription for medical marijuana.
00:47:29.347,00:47:31.056,"So, no."
00:47:31.098,00:47:32.933,I think he's coming over.
00:47:32.975,00:47:34.644,"Wait, he might be going to the food."
00:47:34.686,00:47:36.729,Don't look over there.
00:47:37.689,00:47:39.315,He's here.
00:47:39.357,00:47:40.941,Just saw you looking at me over there.
00:47:40.983,00:47:44.111,"I thought I'd come over, say What's up."
00:47:44.153,00:47:45.154,Hmm.
00:47:47.365,00:47:49.074,"Oh, my God, did I misread that?"
00:47:49.116,00:47:50.951,Were you just talking about...
00:47:50.993,00:47:52.953,"Um, did you not want me to come over?"
00:47:57.166,00:47:58.917,"Hey, I'm Ken."
00:47:58.959,00:48:01.629,You must be Alice's sister.
00:48:01.671,00:48:02.755,"Um, do you want a drink?"
00:48:02.797,00:48:04.089,Can I get you...
00:48:04.131,00:48:06.843,I had a lot of drinks earlier today.
00:48:08.260,00:48:09.886,Have you heard anything about an after-party?
00:48:09.928,00:48:12.264,"Or even, like, another part of this party?"
00:48:12.306,00:48:16.853,"Because this feels like a longer day at work, than..."
00:48:16.893,00:48:18.229,"Oh, my God, am I boring you?"
00:48:18.270,00:48:19.938,Is that... Are you trying not to yawn?
00:48:19.980,00:48:21.982,Mmm-mmm.
00:48:22.024,00:48:25.444,"No, I'm sorry. I'm a doctor, and I'm just really tired."
00:48:25.486,00:48:27.739,What is it you were saying you do?
00:48:27.780,00:48:31.116,"I wasn't, but I work here, for now."
00:48:31.158,00:48:32.660,"But, um..."
00:48:32.702,00:48:35.287,"Oh, my God, are you having a stroke?"
00:48:35.329,00:48:36.913,"Seriously, this is the honeymoon."
00:48:36.955,00:48:38.875,"Like, we just met 30 seconds ago."
00:48:38.915,00:48:42.795,"Honestly, like, if we're not gonna make it through this, I don't think we're gonna make it at all."
00:48:42.837,00:48:45.089,"So, why don't you just, like, let her rip?"
00:48:45.130,00:48:46.883,Okay.
00:48:48.092,00:48:49.761,Yeah.
00:48:49.802,00:48:51.721,How awesome was that?
00:48:51.763,00:48:52.929,That feels so good.
00:48:52.971,00:48:55.015,Right?
00:48:55.057,00:48:56.851,"Who are you, again?"
00:48:56.893,00:48:58.018,"I'm, uh, Ken."
00:48:58.060,00:48:59.896,And what's going on here?
00:48:59.936,00:49:01.188,I don't...
00:49:01.230,00:49:02.899,Is this one of those fetish things?
00:49:02.939,00:49:06.360,"Where you're, like, a foot fetish. Am I the foot?"
00:49:06.402,00:49:08.696,Do you want to be the foot?
00:49:08.738,00:49:12.324,"I'm not into feet, but I would like to go out with you."
00:49:12.366,00:49:13.701,Oh.
00:49:13.743,00:49:15.327,Yes.
00:49:15.369,00:49:17.538,Really? I...
00:49:17.580,00:49:21.041,I do! I... That's not what I was saying.
00:49:21.083,00:49:23.043,Because I think you're hot.
00:49:23.085,00:49:25.379,And I think you're funny.
00:49:25.421,00:49:27.840,And I like the face you make when you're trying not to yawn.
00:49:27.882,00:49:30.217,"And then you have an awesome yawn after that, so..."
00:49:30.259,00:49:32.386,"I mean, that's always something I've looked for in a girl."
00:49:32.428,00:49:34.012,I don't know.
00:49:34.054,00:49:35.431,"But, cheers."
00:49:35.473,00:49:37.850,"Holy shit, that's a candle."
00:49:39.685,00:49:41.145,"So, do you wanna just go do this, then?"
00:49:46.108,00:49:47.109,Oh.
00:49:48.903,00:49:49.904,Mmm.
00:49:53.783,00:49:55.242,I don't want anything serious.
00:49:55.284,00:49:57.411,"Good, because I'm saving myself for marriage."
00:49:57.453,00:49:59.831,I'm just kidding.
00:49:59.872,00:50:01.916,"My God, your body is awesome!"
00:50:03.250,00:50:04.919,Do I smell like hamburgers?
00:50:04.961,00:50:06.504,You taste like hamburgers.
00:50:09.005,00:50:10.341,That's totally beautiful.
00:50:14.303,00:50:16.430,"You didn't really have to come all the way here with me, you know?"
00:50:16.472,00:50:18.349,And miss a subway ride with you?
00:50:18.390,00:50:20.935,That's like 20 extra minutes of Paul time.
00:50:20.977,00:50:22.854,Aw. Thank you. Yeah.
00:50:22.895,00:50:24.522,"Actually, I got you something."
00:50:24.563,00:50:25.898,"Oh, okay."
00:50:25.940,00:50:28.024,I have a sandwich for the train ride.
00:50:28.066,00:50:30.945,"Oh, thank you."
00:50:28.066,00:50:32.488,"And there's a bagel in there, too, in case you don't want the sandwich."
00:50:32.530,00:50:35.574,"It's a 45 minute train ride, but thank you."
00:50:35.616,00:50:37.033,And there's this.
00:50:37.075,00:50:38.160,Merry Christmas.
00:50:38.202,00:50:39.578,You shouldn't have.
00:50:39.620,00:50:41.539,"Really, it's just a little thing that..."
00:50:41.580,00:50:43.457,"Oh. Open it now, yeah."
00:50:45.001,00:50:47.085,Whoa! These are pictures of us.
00:50:47.127,00:50:49.547,It's memories of all our time together.
00:50:49.588,00:50:53.133,"Yeah, there's three weeks of photos. That's..."
00:50:53.175,00:50:55.011,And then we can fill in the rest.
00:50:56.303,00:50:58.138,"Oh, so..."
00:50:58.180,00:51:02.852,"Look, Lucy, I..."
00:51:02.894,00:51:11.151,"And I just don't know if we want to think too much in the long term, only because I don't know if I see a future with you."
00:51:11.193,00:51:16.532,"Normally, I break up with people before the holidays, just so, you know, they don't get the wrong idea."
00:51:16.574,00:51:23.205,"But I just thought, since we're dating other people, I would just wait and break up with you on Martin Luther King Day."
00:51:23.247,00:51:25.833,"Okay, I have no idea what that means, but it sounds vaguely racist."
00:51:25.875,00:51:29.545,"Just, statistically, it's the easiest holiday to break up with someone on, you know?"
00:51:29.587,00:51:33.591,"I mean, there's no family obligations, you can get out before Valentine's Day."
00:51:33.632,00:51:36.886,"I'm sorry, did you just say you're seeing other people?"
00:51:36.928,00:51:38.554,Yeah.
00:51:38.596,00:51:40.556,"I mean, isn't that the whole point of online dating?"
00:51:40.598,00:51:42.098,No.
00:51:42.140,00:51:44.435,It's to find your soul mate!
00:51:46.562,00:51:51.149,"I, uh, think maybe we should only see other people."
00:51:52.150,00:51:53.903,Okay. Great talk.
00:51:55.571,00:51:56.572,Bye.
00:51:58.407,00:51:59.784,Just...
00:51:59.825,00:52:01.493,"Um, Merry Christmas."
00:52:05.330,00:52:10.210,"'We're safe!' said Paul, as they ran from the dragon."
00:52:10.252,00:52:11.629,"Um, who's Paul?"
00:52:12.922,00:52:15.674,"Sorry, the Prince."
00:52:15.716,00:52:21.013,"Then, he leaned in to kiss her, and finally said..."
00:52:25.684,00:52:27.227,"Oh, that's rich."
00:52:27.269,00:52:28.604,How does the story end?
00:52:28.646,00:52:30.481,I'll tell you how it ends.
00:52:30.522,00:52:38.322,"He kisses her, and she wakes up and finally feels loved, and understood, and wanted."
00:52:38.363,00:52:44.286,"But then, her friend sees him dining with the peach lady and before she knows it, she's kicked out of the castle."
00:52:45.079,00:52:46.705,The peach lady?
00:52:46.747,00:52:48.707,You bet your sweet ass the peach lady.
00:52:48.749,00:53:00.011,"And now, you know, she's fixating on all her mistakes and all the money she spent on makeup and blow-outs, and the heels!"
00:53:00.052,00:53:02.471,The heels!
00:53:02.513,00:53:05.432,And I'm not supposed to have any hair here.
00:53:05.474,00:53:08.268,"No hair here, but tons of it here."
00:53:08.310,00:53:10.146,"I'm supposed to have a ton, a ton of it here."
00:53:10.186,00:53:11.522,You think this is all real?
00:53:11.563,00:53:13.524,You think that it's all real?
00:53:13.565,00:53:15.067,And Spanx!
00:53:15.109,00:53:18.112,Girls. Never wear Spanx.
00:53:18.154,00:53:28.539,"Because the endgame is to take them off, anyway and then the prince is gonna see all your dumplings and there ain't nothing less attractive than trying to squiggle your way out of what's basically sausage casing."
00:53:28.580,00:53:30.082,Look at these links!
00:53:30.124,00:53:33.335,"You know what, why don't we push pause on story time for just a second, huh?"
00:53:33.377,00:53:34.753,"GEORGE: Okay, you know what? Sorry."
00:53:34.795,00:53:36.380,Are you kidding me?
00:53:36.421,00:53:38.298,These are kid scissors.
00:53:38.340,00:53:40.134,"If your Spanx were made of construction paper, they would."
00:53:40.176,00:53:43.470,And that's how the story ends.
00:53:43.512,00:53:46.557,"Parents, I'm gonna ask you to sign something before you leave, if you don't mind."
00:53:46.598,00:53:47.975,Story time next week.
00:53:48.017,00:53:50.352,"Same time, same place, different reader."
00:53:50.394,00:53:53.271,"Thank you. Okay, now."
00:53:53.313,00:53:55.983,Look at me. Hi. Hello. Hi.
00:53:56.025,00:53:57.526,"Oh, that was terrible."
00:53:57.568,00:54:00.988,"You scared all the kids, terrified a lot of parents."
00:54:01.030,00:54:04.075,But it was also kind of awesome.
00:54:06.077,00:54:07.536,I'm George.
00:54:10.039,00:54:11.165,Lucy.
00:54:14.752,00:54:16.003,Hey.
00:54:16.045,00:54:17.671,JOSH: Hey.
00:54:17.713,00:54:19.297,"Hey! Oh, thank you."
00:54:19.339,00:54:20.549,For you.
00:54:20.591,00:54:22.300,"Oh, no."
00:54:22.342,00:54:25.179,Yeah. I like to keep this on my own rack.
00:54:25.221,00:54:26.513,"Sorry, we're late."
00:54:26.555,00:54:28.599,"No, it's okay. I'm glad you guys could come."
00:54:28.640,00:54:32.561,"I know it's tough to be single around this time of year, so..."
00:54:32.603,00:54:36.565,Why do people always say that? The holidays is he best time to be single.
00:54:36.607,00:54:39.068,"Parties every night, free-flowing booze."
00:54:39.110,00:54:41.653,Mmm-hmm.
00:54:41.695,00:54:43.197,What?
00:54:43.239,00:54:44.782,"Yeah, take your jacket..."
00:54:44.823,00:54:46.200,"Here, you want me to get your..."
00:54:46.242,00:54:47.534,Thanks for having us.
00:54:47.576,00:54:51.205,"Yeah, sure. I know it's been tough for you."
00:54:51.247,00:54:52.790,For me?
00:54:52.831,00:54:54.708,"No, I'm good."
00:54:54.750,00:54:58.212,It's really cool of your girlfriend to be okay with me coming tonight.
00:54:58.254,00:55:00.547,"Yeah. Yeah, I know, she's really mature."
00:55:00.589,00:55:03.550,"And, um, also, I told her you're my cousin."
00:55:03.592,00:55:05.761,"Hi, baby."
00:55:05.803,00:55:08.264,"Oh, you must be Alice."
00:55:08.304,00:55:10.182,Hi!
00:55:16.563,00:55:18.107,"KEN: Oh, Meg!"
00:55:18.149,00:55:19.233,Hi.
00:55:19.275,00:55:20.567,"Hi, what are you doing here?"
00:55:20.609,00:55:21.735,I brought you hot chocolate.
00:55:21.777,00:55:22.778,For what?
00:55:22.820,00:55:24.362,For drinking.
00:55:24.404,00:55:26.073,"Oh, I have to be back at work in eight minutes."
00:55:26.115,00:55:27.241,Perfect.
00:55:27.283,00:55:28.533,"Oh, thank you."
00:55:28.575,00:55:30.828,That was nice. Hi.
00:55:30.869,00:55:32.288,It's good to see you.
00:55:32.328,00:55:33.747,"Oh, oh, there's bourbon in there."
00:55:33.789,00:55:35.291,"Also, was that a real-life spit take?"
00:55:35.331,00:55:37.333,Mmm.
00:55:37.375,00:55:38.794,I just sort of thought it would be like...
00:55:41.379,00:55:42.589,Wow.
00:55:44.300,00:55:45.509,"That was good, yeah."
00:55:45.550,00:55:49.847,I can't drink alcohol right now because I'm about to deliver a baby.
00:55:49.888,00:55:51.473,It's so cool you're a doctor.
00:55:52.474,00:55:53.600,It's so cool that you're...
00:55:53.642,00:55:55.351,A receptionist.
00:55:55.393,00:55:59.523,"Oh, okay. So, what's the male version of a receptionist?"
00:55:59.564,00:56:01.525,Receptionist.
00:56:01.566,00:56:03.610,"Oh, I just love the thrill of it, you know?"
00:56:03.652,00:56:05.904,"Like, Hello? Hold, please."
00:56:05.946,00:56:07.990,But I'm thinking about quitting. I don't know.
00:56:08.032,00:56:10.492,It's starting to feel like the restaurant I worked at.
00:56:10.534,00:56:15.122,Oh.
00:56:15.164,00:56:16.748,"Come on, we'll get one."
00:56:16.790,00:56:19.335,"Okay. I mean, I don't get Christmas trees, but..."
00:56:19.375,00:56:22.420,"Oh, are you Jewish?"
00:56:22.462,00:56:24.173,"Oh, so, you're a monster."
00:56:24.215,00:56:27.383,"No, I'm just never home, and I would definitely kill it."
00:56:27.425,00:56:28.802,No.
00:56:28.844,00:56:32.556,And then those needles fall into the rug and stab your feet when you walk on them.
00:56:32.597,00:56:33.891,Okay.
00:56:33.932,00:56:36.392,All right.
00:56:36.434,00:56:38.312,That's the John McClane of Christmas trees.
00:56:38.354,00:56:40.189,"Like, you cannot kill this guy."
00:56:40.231,00:56:46.611,"We load him up with a bunch of water, stuff one of those self-pouring cat bottles on the side, you're good to go for, like, three weeks."
00:56:46.653,00:56:48.239,"I'm telling you, you're gonna be begging this guy to die."
00:56:48.280,00:56:49.740,Yeah.
00:56:48.280,00:56:53.493,"Then, in three weeks we throw this guy out on the street, and get ready for Valentine's Day."
00:56:53.535,00:56:54.995,We get ready for Valentine's Day?
00:56:55.037,00:56:57.331,"Yeah, hearts, candy, you name it."
00:56:57.373,00:56:59.958,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
00:57:00.000,00:57:15.682,"Listen, in three weeks from now, I think the novelty of this whole thing will have worn off and I think, the reality will set in, which is that I work all the time and I probably would never see you, and I'd probably have to cancel all of our dates."
00:57:15.724,00:57:20.645,"And, when I did finally see you, I would probably just fall asleep on your face."
00:57:20.687,00:57:22.231,Oh...
00:57:20.687,00:57:24.066,"Yeah, and then, .you would go off, and meet some girl at the gym."
00:57:24.108,00:57:29.988,"Because you obviously have a lot of time to spend at the gym and so would she, and I don't even know why we're having this conversation."
00:57:30.030,00:57:34.868,"I mean, you are obviously not a real thing and I feel like we're wasting air even talking about it."
00:57:34.910,00:57:41.875,"And I have hip problems, real hip problems, and not from doing fun things, like having sex, but from gravity."
00:57:41.917,00:57:43.794,And what we had was great.
00:57:43.835,00:57:47.631,Thank you for helping me out with that.
00:57:47.672,00:57:49.007,That was fun.
00:57:49.049,00:57:55.389,But you will find a girl your own age and then you can do fun things like look for trees and whatever.
00:57:55.431,00:57:58.392,"But that's not what's happening here, between you and me, so..."
00:57:58.434,00:57:59.643,Just so you know.
00:57:59.684,00:58:01.519,I have to get back to work now.
00:58:03.730,00:58:05.023,My God.
00:58:05.065,00:58:06.984,"Fine, we won't get a Christmas tree!"
00:58:08.277,00:58:11.696,JOSH: You okay? You happy?
00:58:14.325,00:58:17.702,JOSH: You did good.
00:58:18.996,00:58:20.247,Mmm. You're sweet.
00:58:32.343,00:58:33.593,"Hey, Robin."
00:58:33.635,00:58:34.636,Yeah.
00:58:37.597,00:58:38.890,MAN: Oh.
00:58:38.932,00:58:41.059,Do you want to go see the Rockefeller tree?
00:58:41.101,00:58:42.644,Right now?
00:58:42.686,00:58:50.402,"No, Buzz-Cut and Dimples are visiting from Italy, and they want to know all about American Christmas traditions like us sitting on their faces."
00:58:50.444,00:58:52.737,No. No.
00:58:52.779,00:58:55.073,I'm not gonna do that tonight.
00:58:55.115,00:58:57.284,Why? Their dicks probably look like cannolis.
00:58:57.326,00:59:00.037,"No, it's okay."
00:59:07.627,00:59:10.422,It's plastic.
00:59:43.038,00:59:44.122,DAVID: Hey.
00:59:45.040,00:59:46.041,Hey.
00:59:47.209,00:59:49.753,I feel like I know you.
00:59:49.794,00:59:53.048,"God, I wish I had one of your business cards, so I could remember who you are."
00:59:55.133,00:59:59.304,"Yeah, you're the, um, fancy married guy, with the kid and the buildings."
00:59:59.346,01:00:01.806,"Uh, I'm not married."
01:00:01.848,01:00:03.475,"Um, I do have a daughter."
01:00:04.226,01:00:05.352,Oh.
01:00:05.394,01:00:06.937,And I'm fancy.
01:00:06.978,01:00:09.647,You're wearing a scarf on the outside of your jacket.
01:00:09.689,01:00:11.567,Which...
01:00:13.818,01:00:14.819,Um...
01:00:16.280,01:00:21.659,"Uh, this is super random, but do you want to go see the Rockefeller tree with me?"
01:00:22.786,01:00:24.246,No? That's a big no.
01:00:24.288,01:00:26.206,"No, no."
01:00:26.248,01:00:29.376,"I know it's probably like so crowded with so many tourists, I don't know why I even want to do that."
01:00:29.418,01:00:32.129,"I just... I was just thinking, I want to show you something."
01:00:33.589,01:00:34.631,Okay.
01:00:37.092,01:00:39.219,This door.
01:00:40.845,01:00:43.223,Aye.
01:00:43.265,01:00:44.641,You know what?
01:00:43.265,01:00:50.606,"I am just realizing now that I've gone with a complete stranger, to an abandoned location covered in plastic."
01:00:50.647,01:00:53.733,"So, if you're gonna Dexter me..."
01:00:53.775,01:00:55.693,You know what? Honestly?
01:00:55.735,01:00:57.779,"Dying would not be the worst thing in the world, right now."
01:00:57.821,01:00:59.490,What is happening?
01:00:59.531,01:01:01.575,Okay. Here we go. Bye!
01:01:04.119,01:01:05.745,What is that sound?
01:01:05.787,01:01:08.123,The world's largest shower curtain?
01:01:08.165,01:01:09.583,What is it? What's happening?
01:01:09.625,01:01:11.251,One sec. Uh...
01:01:11.293,01:01:12.503,Is that the body bag?
01:01:12.544,01:01:13.920,Is that duct tape?
01:01:13.962,01:01:16.465,Is it duck tape or is it duct tape?
01:01:17.257,01:01:18.383,"Um, open your eyes."
01:01:32.147,01:01:33.773,"Oh, my God."
01:01:35.192,01:01:36.943,This is amazing.
01:01:42.491,01:01:44.326,Thank you.
01:01:44.368,01:01:45.702,I've always wanted to see this.
01:01:45.743,01:01:47.120,Yeah.
01:01:47.162,01:01:50.290,I don't know why I always talk myself out of doing the things that I really want to do.
01:01:50.332,01:01:51.875,Like what?
01:01:51.916,01:01:56.880,"There's this thing that people do on New Year's, where they hike the Grand Canyon in the dark, Hmm."
01:01:56.921,01:02:00.342,so that they can watch the New Year come in with the dawn.
01:02:00.384,01:02:02.469,That sounds amazing.
01:02:02.511,01:02:04.137,I know.
01:02:04.179,01:02:06.223,I'm just not a hiker.
01:02:06.264,01:02:09.809,"I don't like that stuff that's on the ground, that, like, gets on you."
01:02:09.851,01:02:11.520,The dirt?
01:02:13.438,01:02:17.275,"But, um, I don't know."
01:02:17.317,01:02:21.946,"Maybe we can, um, do something else this year."
01:02:21.988,01:02:23.657,We?
01:02:35.793,01:02:37.588,This one's name is Ping-Ping.
01:02:37.629,01:02:38.838,Ping-Ping?
01:02:38.880,01:02:39.964,It's nice to meet you.
01:02:40.006,01:02:41.258,ALICE: Who's this guy?
01:02:41.299,01:02:43.009,Lion.
01:02:43.051,01:02:45.887,"Lion is very handsome and, also, we seem to be matching."
01:02:45.929,01:02:47.264,"Well, what about this guy?"
01:02:47.305,01:02:49.224,Zebra-Zebra.
01:02:49.266,01:02:51.893,Hmm. I was told never to trust a man with two first names.
01:02:53.895,01:02:55.980,"What about, do you want to tell me the names of these ones?"
01:02:56.022,01:02:57.524,This is LA.
01:02:57.566,01:02:59.859,"Okay, we're fine."
01:02:59.901,01:03:01.945,Do you know the Eyes of You song?
01:03:01.986,01:03:03.447,The what song?
01:03:03.488,01:03:04.989,Eyes of You song.
01:03:05.031,01:03:06.824,"No, I don't know what that is."
01:03:11.705,01:03:13.415,"Oh, I know that song."
01:03:22.674,01:03:24.301,What are you doing?
01:03:24.342,01:03:28.263,"Well, we were working on our pop star careers, but her voice is way better than mine."
01:03:28.305,01:03:29.473,Can I talk to you?
01:03:29.514,01:03:30.848,"Yeah, yeah."
01:03:38.064,01:03:39.650,"Uh, what are you doing?"
01:03:39.691,01:03:40.900,What do you mean?
01:03:40.942,01:03:42.569,You're not her mom.
01:03:42.611,01:03:44.446,What are you...
01:03:44.488,01:03:45.697,What do you mean?
01:03:47.741,01:03:49.951,"We were just singing, David."
01:03:49.993,01:03:56.916,"Look, I'm sorry, but when it comes to Phoebe, I get very protective."
01:03:56.958,01:03:59.670,"And, you can't just..."
01:04:01.879,01:04:03.173,"Look, I'm really sorry."
01:04:03.214,01:04:05.509,I didn't know that that was a thing.
01:04:05.550,01:04:07.678,"I'm not trying to, like..."
01:04:10.013,01:04:16.060,I guess I didn't know that that would upset you because you don't actually ever really share anything with me.
01:04:33.495,01:04:35.706,Do you know how I found out your wife passed away?
01:04:37.499,01:04:38.958,"From your doorman, David."
01:04:39.000,01:04:40.544,"Yeah, well."
01:04:40.585,01:04:42.796,I just thought you were divorced. I had no idea.
01:04:42.838,01:04:44.589,"It's just been two years, okay?"
01:04:44.631,01:04:46.675,Phoebe's not ready for all that.
01:04:46.717,01:04:49.845,I have no idea what it's like to be a parent.
01:04:49.886,01:04:52.806,"But, I feel like you have to open up to Phoebe about her mom."
01:04:52.848,01:04:54.057,"Look, Alice."
01:04:55.642,01:04:56.768,I can't do this.
01:04:58.061,01:04:59.521,I'm sorry.
01:06:20.184,01:06:23.020,"I'm not supposed to need you anymore, but..."
01:06:28.485,01:06:29.569,I really do.
01:06:30.695,01:06:31.780,Come here.
01:06:36.242,01:06:40.831,I feel like I don't even know who I am anymore.
01:06:40.872,01:06:42.206,It's okay.
01:06:48.505,01:06:51.424,"I have to warn you, I have this weird farting thing happening."
01:06:53.468,01:06:56.513,"I don't know if it's me, or the baby farting through me, or what, but..."
01:06:58.556,01:07:00.183,Let me see.
01:07:02.644,01:07:04.187,"Hi, you stinky little baby."
01:07:07.816,01:07:11.152,you're not gonna be able to hide this for much longer.
01:07:12.153,01:07:13.822,You need to tell him.
01:07:24.123,01:07:25.959,"I love you, monkey."
01:07:26.001,01:07:27.293,I love you.
01:07:36.845,01:07:39.138,"Hey, Happy Alcoholic's Day."
01:07:40.306,01:07:42.475,"All right, let me guess."
01:07:42.517,01:07:47.188,"You're one of those parade-hating buzzkills that stays at home, while the rest of us are out here, celebrating Saint Patrick's Day."
01:07:47.230,01:07:49.273,No. You know what?
01:07:49.315,01:07:51.526,George is an eighth Irish.
01:07:51.568,01:07:53.236,"Do you think he'll like it? Look, I did..."
01:07:54.696,01:07:55.780,Who's George?
01:07:55.822,01:07:57.615,Luce. Hey!
01:07:57.657,01:07:59.116,"Oh, there he is!"
01:08:00.577,01:08:03.079,That's George?
01:08:03.120,01:08:04.998,Happy Saint Patrick's Day!
01:08:05.040,01:08:06.165,Yes!
01:08:08.585,01:08:09.586,BOTH: Mmm.
01:09:23.618,01:09:25.996,Hi.
01:09:26.037,01:09:27.122,It's been forever.
01:09:27.163,01:09:28.164,Yeah.
01:09:29.373,01:09:30.917,Are you here with somebody?
01:09:30.959,01:09:33.753,"Oh, no. I'm, I'm, I'm alone."
01:09:33.795,01:09:37.757,"I just thought I'd grab some pancakes, 'cause I love pancakes."
01:09:37.799,01:09:39.216,Okay.
01:09:39.258,01:09:40.844,What are you doing?
01:09:40.885,01:09:42.219,I'm here with my parents.
01:09:42.261,01:09:43.847,"JOSH'S MOM: Oh, my God."
01:09:43.888,01:09:45.515,JOSH'S DAD: Look who it is.
01:09:45.556,01:09:46.766,ALICE: Hi! How are you?
01:09:46.808,01:09:48.184,We're here to celebrate.
01:09:48.225,01:09:49.352,How are you?
01:09:49.393,01:09:51.896,Josh got into business school.
01:09:51.938,01:09:53.106,What?
01:09:53.148,01:09:54.398,It just happened. It's crazy.
01:09:54.440,01:09:56.026,I didn't even know you wanted to...
01:09:56.067,01:09:57.234,JOSH'S DAD: We were just gonna take a picture.
01:09:57.276,01:09:58.569,"Come on, get in here."
01:09:58.611,01:10:00.113,We're just gonna take a picture.
01:10:00.155,01:10:01.238,"JOSH'S DAD: Come on, come on, get in here."
01:10:01.280,01:10:02.657,Squeeze in.
01:10:02.699,01:10:03.783,Selfie time!
01:10:03.825,01:10:04.993,"No, I can take one of you guys."
01:10:05.035,01:10:06.036,Three!
01:10:06.077,01:10:08.121,You're better than her.
01:10:08.163,01:10:09.288,Wow. What?
01:10:09.330,01:10:10.790,JOSH'S MOM: What?
01:10:10.832,01:10:12.625,You need to go inside.
01:10:12.667,01:10:14.044,I know you've said it a million times.
01:10:14.085,01:10:15.628,All right. There you go.
01:10:14.085,01:10:17.172,"Take her inside, and then take her home."
01:10:17.213,01:10:18.339,ALICE: Great to see you.
01:10:18.381,01:10:19.423,"Bye, guys."
01:10:19.465,01:10:20.717,It's great to see you.
01:10:20.758,01:10:21.843,It's great to see you.
01:10:21.885,01:10:23.011,Yeah.
01:10:23.053,01:10:24.971,Yeah.
01:10:27.807,01:10:29.392,"Don't squash my pancakes, man."
01:10:29.433,01:10:30.643,"Oh, sorry."
01:10:30.685,01:10:32.145,Do you want to...
01:10:32.187,01:10:33.688,We should hang out soon.
01:10:33.730,01:10:35.148,Okay.
01:10:35.815,01:10:36.983,Bye.
01:11:19.525,01:11:20.777,Are you pregnant?
01:11:26.199,01:11:27.200,What?
01:11:29.202,01:11:30.870,I've been trying to have a baby. Yes.
01:11:30.912,01:11:34.331,I... It's probably not even going to stick.
01:11:34.373,01:11:36.126,"Yeah, I think it stuck."
01:11:36.167,01:11:43.340,"Okay, I don't know what that tone was but, if you haven't noticed, my boobs have gotten much bigger."
01:11:43.382,01:11:45.093,"Yeah, of course I noticed your boobs getting bigger."
01:11:45.135,01:11:46.886,"I put that on my vision board, okay?"
01:11:46.928,01:11:48.179,I thought that was because of me.
01:11:48.221,01:11:49.472,Who does that?
01:11:49.513,01:11:51.724,"I do! People like me, visionaries!"
01:11:51.766,01:11:53.434,Didn't you notice that I was getting fat?
01:11:53.476,01:11:56.229,That's a trick question.
01:11:56.271,01:12:00.066,"You are beautiful, you have always been beautiful, and you are carrying this so well."
01:12:01.442,01:12:03.402,Is this why you've been avoiding me lately?
01:12:03.444,01:12:05.029,"Oh, my God."
01:12:05.071,01:12:06.823,I think I'm gonna...
01:12:08.116,01:12:09.159,I'm gonna be a dad!
01:12:09.200,01:12:10.409,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
01:12:10.451,01:12:11.911,"Sorry, we're gonna have a baby!"
01:12:11.953,01:12:14.371,We're gonna be...
01:12:16.124,01:12:17.541,"No, it's not."
01:12:17.583,01:12:20.377,"Like, you're not..."
01:12:20.419,01:12:21.963,Is that not mine?
01:12:22.005,01:12:23.256,I'm just pregnant.
01:12:23.298,01:12:24.632,"What do you mean, you're just pregnant?"
01:12:24.674,01:12:26.009,That's crazy.
01:12:26.050,01:12:27.384,What?
01:12:27.426,01:12:31.806,You've lied to me the entire time we've been together about being pregnant and now you're upset with me because I believed it?
01:12:31.848,01:12:33.266,That's what a crazy person does.
01:12:33.308,01:12:35.935,That's three times.
01:12:35.977,01:12:37.353,Say it again.
01:12:37.394,01:12:39.189,I don't know. It just seems crazy to me.
01:12:39.230,01:12:41.149,I just want to tell you something.
01:12:41.191,01:12:46.196,"Usually, it's a good idea not to call a pregnant woman crazy."
01:12:46.237,01:12:47.822,what I mean?
01:12:47.864,01:12:49.199,"She's nuts, everybody."
01:12:53.161,01:12:54.495,"Oh, sh... Oh, my God!"
01:12:54.537,01:12:55.579,Not funny!
01:12:55.621,01:12:56.831,"Get it, girl."
01:13:01.294,01:13:03.129,Who is the father?
01:13:03.171,01:13:05.298,I don't know! I don't know.
01:13:05.340,01:13:06.341,How do you not know?
01:13:06.382,01:13:07.800,Stop yelling at me.
01:13:07.842,01:13:08.801,How could you not know something like that?
01:13:08.843,01:13:10.136,Did you not catch his name?
01:13:10.178,01:13:11.888,I did I.V.F. with a sperm donor.
01:13:11.929,01:13:13.139,"Oh, my God."
01:13:13.181,01:13:14.807,Do you have a problem with that?
01:13:14.849,01:13:16.226,I don't have a problem with that. It's your body.
01:13:16.267,01:13:17.601,Do whatever you want with your body.
01:13:17.643,01:13:19.229,Cover it in tattoos.
01:13:19.270,01:13:22.190,I think I deserve to know when there's someone living inside the person I'm having sex with.
01:13:22.232,01:13:24.025,Don't say that. That's gross!
01:13:24.067,01:13:26.402,There is nothing gross about that. It is beautiful!
01:13:26.443,01:13:28.487,It's not your problem.
01:13:28.529,01:13:31.366,But my girlfriend is having a baby.
01:13:31.407,01:13:35.912,"Babe, if we're gonna make this thing work, like, this is the kind of thing I need to know."
01:13:35.953,01:13:38.289,What are you gonna do?
01:13:39.207,01:13:41.167,Did I just win the lottery?
01:13:41.209,01:13:43.294,"Yes, I want to stay home and take care of a baby."
01:13:43.336,01:13:46.630,"When I was eight years old, my Halloween costume was a stay-at-home dad."
01:13:46.672,01:13:48.258,You're saying I never have to go to work again.
01:13:48.299,01:13:49.884,I get to hang out with a baby all day?
01:13:49.926,01:13:51.677,Just stop saying the word baby.
01:13:51.719,01:13:52.929,"Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby!"
01:13:54.389,01:13:56.849,"Okay, listen."
01:13:56.891,01:14:05.275,"You and I, we probably would have a lot of fun together and then, one day, we would be on this road trip together."
01:14:05.316,01:14:12.365,"And I would be driving, and then I'd get tired and I would hate to do it, but I would agree to let you drive."
01:14:12.407,01:14:16.619,"And then, I would feel very safe, and that's when we would crash."
01:14:16.660,01:14:19.663,"You think you can control everything, but you can't."
01:14:20.664,01:14:22.875,That's not how this works.
01:14:22.917,01:14:26.503,"If I could choose someone to do this with, it would be you."
01:14:26.545,01:14:28.131,You can choose!
01:14:28.172,01:14:31.926,"I just... I'm not the only one in the car, anymore."
01:14:35.721,01:14:37.098,Yeah.
01:14:39.142,01:14:42.645,"Well, for the record, this is not me leaving."
01:14:42.686,01:14:44.730,This is you pushing me away.
01:15:31.152,01:15:33.112,Daddy?
01:15:33.154,01:15:35.406,I want the Eyes of You song.
01:15:35.448,01:15:37.074,Sing it to me.
01:15:38.742,01:15:41.537,"Not tonight, sweetheart. Okay?"
01:15:44.665,01:15:45.666,Get some sleep.
01:16:19.200,01:16:27.750,"ALICE: It's just, Josh and I could be married by now and we would have, like, the cutest little baby daughter and she would probably be named after a fruit."
01:16:27.791,01:16:30.420,"What kind of name is George, anyway? Right?"
01:16:30.461,01:16:32.463,I hate his hair.
01:16:32.505,01:16:37.718,"Actually, technically, we would have a four-year-old daughter, in which case, her name would be Rihanna."
01:16:37.760,01:16:40.179,What? We haven't known each other four years.
01:16:40.221,01:16:41.680,"No, not you. Josh."
01:16:41.722,01:16:43.349,"Oh, right, yeah."
01:16:43.391,01:16:45.726,"But, exactly. It's the same thing with me and Lucy."
01:16:45.768,01:16:50.147,"It's like, if I go to work, and she's not there, I'm like mad or something."
01:16:50.189,01:16:54.193,"Yeah. Which is nuts, because she's not completely disgusted by you."
01:16:54.235,01:16:56.571,I don't get it. I don't know where I'm gonna find another one like her.
01:16:56.612,01:16:59.198,"Yeah. I don't know, man."
01:16:59.240,01:17:02.701,Maybe we've just made all the wrong moves.
01:17:02.743,01:17:08.541,"Maybe, this whole time, we've been focusing on all the wrong stuff and now it's just too late."
01:17:08.583,01:17:11.335,To the wrong stuff.
01:17:11.377,01:17:13.629,This is it.
01:17:15.256,01:17:16.466,What are you talking about?
01:17:17.425,01:17:19.469,Our drink number.
01:17:19.510,01:17:25.724,"In every male and female friendship, there's a number of drinks, and if you pass it, you have to have sex, mathematically."
01:17:25.766,01:17:27.435,"Whatever, dude."
01:17:30.563,01:17:32.648,Oi. Sorry. Loud noise.
01:17:32.689,01:17:34.650,Wha... Where did that come from?
01:17:34.691,01:17:36.777,"Uh, the floor."
01:17:38.279,01:17:41.740,"One, two, three."
01:17:43.326,01:17:46.412,"Four, five, six."
01:17:47.704,01:17:48.872,Seven.
01:17:52.251,01:17:53.961,"Eight, nine."
01:17:59.967,01:18:02.886,It's just ten. It's just ten.
01:18:06.849,01:18:08.601,Eleven. Did you drink this?
01:18:08.643,01:18:09.644,No.
01:18:09.685,01:18:10.894,"Oh, thank God."
01:18:10.936,01:18:12.355,You did.
01:18:24.825,01:18:26.785,This may be a mistake.
01:18:26.827,01:18:28.829,It's just such a bad idea.
01:18:28.871,01:18:31.374,"Yeah, I'm sorry. I was trying to bone the Lucy out of my system."
01:18:31.415,01:18:33.626,"Yeah, see, normally, I feel like I'd be mad at that."
01:18:33.668,01:18:35.419,But I just did the exact same thing to you.
01:18:35.461,01:18:36.504,"Right, yeah."
01:18:36.546,01:18:38.839,Shit. I think I like her.
01:18:40.007,01:18:47.390,"Like, when we're together, I feel like me, but, like, a better me."
01:18:50.351,01:18:53.604,"See, that's the magic."
01:18:53.646,01:18:54.647,Yeah.
01:18:59.610,01:19:01.529,I can let myself out.
01:19:43.446,01:19:45.364,Whoa!
01:19:45.406,01:19:48.867,Alice! Happy Birthday!
01:19:48.909,01:19:50.244,Hi!
01:19:50.286,01:19:51.912,Thank you. What is that?
01:19:51.954,01:19:53.581,"Um, this is actually for Meg."
01:19:53.623,01:19:55.082,"I had it made for her, specially."
01:19:56.417,01:19:57.710,ALICE: Aw...
01:19:57.752,01:20:02.465,That is so sweet.
01:20:02.506,01:20:04.841,Maybe I'll give it to her.
01:20:04.883,01:20:06.009,Hey!
01:20:06.051,01:20:11.932,"ALICE: No Tom, no Josh, I'm just gonna have a really good time and I'm not gonna think about any boys at all."
01:20:11.974,01:20:13.850,Here's to no drama.
01:20:13.892,01:20:16.562,No drama.
01:20:23.819,01:20:25.738,Happy Birthday!
01:20:34.955,01:20:36.123,Whoo!
01:20:44.590,01:20:45.675,"TOM: Thanks, buddy."
01:20:48.469,01:20:49.762,I'll show you. This way.
01:20:52.473,01:20:53.641,"Oh, my God."
01:20:56.101,01:20:57.394,"Dude, Ricky Stimpkins!"
01:20:57.436,01:20:58.895,"Josh! What's up, man?"
01:20:58.937,01:21:00.105,"Wow, I haven't seen you since college, man!"
01:21:00.147,01:21:02.024,I'm just hanging.
01:21:02.065,01:21:03.942,"I got to go get a drink, but I'll catch you later."
01:21:03.984,01:21:05.027,"Okay, cool. Yeah, man."
01:21:05.068,01:21:06.529,I'm gonna find Alice.
01:21:07.697,01:21:09.406,Tall person.
01:21:13.035,01:21:19.458,"TOM: We got a whole No hats thing but, uh, you seem like a good guy, and, you know..."
01:21:19.500,01:21:21.084,"Hey. What's up, guys?"
01:21:21.126,01:21:22.628,Hey.
01:21:23.504,01:21:24.714,You're Josh?
01:21:24.755,01:21:25.922,What's that supposed to mean?
01:21:25.964,01:21:28.801,"No, nothing."
01:21:28.843,01:21:30.177,"Wait, how do you know Alice?"
01:21:30.219,01:21:31.637,How do you guys know Alice?
01:21:31.679,01:21:33.138,"Oh, fuck me."
01:21:33.180,01:21:34.724,This is Josh.
01:21:34.765,01:21:36.058,Makes sense.
01:21:36.099,01:21:38.435,"What? Are you guys new friends, or..."
01:21:42.606,01:21:44.107,"Oh, my God."
01:21:44.149,01:21:45.568,Come here.
01:21:45.609,01:21:48.821,"Um, Tom is here, and David, and Josh."
01:21:48.863,01:21:50.656,And David. Did I say David?
01:21:50.698,01:21:52.491,"Yeah, I know, because I invited them."
01:21:52.533,01:21:53.701,You're welcome.
01:21:53.743,01:21:55.202,Why? Why would you do that?
01:21:55.244,01:21:57.996,Because I thought it would be funny. For me.
01:21:58.038,01:22:02.543,"And good for you, emotionally, to have guys fighting over you."
01:22:06.881,01:22:08.173,Hey.
01:22:08.215,01:22:09.966,What's going on?
01:22:10.008,01:22:13.178,"Pretty good. Uh, I need to talk to you about something."
01:22:13.220,01:22:14.221,"Great. Me, too."
01:22:14.263,01:22:15.514,You go first.
01:22:15.556,01:22:16.557,I'm getting married.
01:22:16.599,01:22:17.641,What?
01:22:17.683,01:22:19.059,"That's, uh..."
01:22:20.895,01:22:25.816,"Look, your computer programs are total bullshit."
01:22:25.858,01:22:28.569,Your algorithms?
01:22:28.611,01:22:31.655,"Just because the music stops, doesn't mean you got to sit in the closest chair."
01:22:31.697,01:22:33.866,You shouldn't be with George.
01:22:33.908,01:22:35.033,You should be with me.
01:22:36.869,01:22:38.579,Yes. I want to be with you.
01:22:38.621,01:22:39.914,What?
01:22:39.955,01:22:44.167,"God, all those bad dates at the bar, there was something that was always there."
01:22:44.710,01:22:45.753,You.
01:22:47.922,01:22:49.214,It was always me.
01:22:49.256,01:22:51.133,"Yes. Oh, my God."
01:22:51.174,01:22:52.718,We could have the best life together.
01:22:52.760,01:22:56.847,"And, I mean, we're gonna want to get married soon because we'll probably want to start a family right away."
01:22:56.889,01:22:57.932,"Oh, my God. Our kids."
01:22:57.973,01:23:00.517,Our kids are gonna be so cute.
01:23:00.559,01:23:02.018,Exactly.
01:23:02.060,01:23:07.149,"Which is why we should just kind of pump the brakes and not rush things, you know?"
01:23:07.190,01:23:10.694,Let's... Let's take care of us right now.
01:23:10.736,01:23:12.070,"Oh, my God, Tom."
01:23:12.112,01:23:13.989,I'm totally messing with you.
01:23:14.030,01:23:15.908,"Thank you. Oh, my God."
01:23:15.950,01:23:17.618,I don't want to be with you.
01:23:17.660,01:23:19.244,"And you don't want to be with me, either."
01:23:19.286,01:23:21.705,Wait.
01:23:21.747,01:23:23.206,"Oh, my God."
01:23:23.248,01:23:25.083,"I thought you were gonna hyperventilate, man."
01:23:25.125,01:23:26.752,But I didn't!
01:23:26.794,01:23:28.253,"Oh, Tom."
01:23:28.295,01:23:29.797,Come on. Don't be sad.
01:23:29.839,01:23:31.298,You know what this is?
01:23:31.340,01:23:37.304,"This is the first, tiny green sprout of life fighting its way out of the gravel parking lot of your heart."
01:23:37.346,01:23:39.264,"So, congrats."
01:23:41.642,01:23:42.852,"Thank you, hon."
01:23:42.893,01:23:44.269,"GEORGE: Oh, hang on, one second."
01:23:44.311,01:23:46.605,"Hey, quick, man, just one last thing."
01:23:46.647,01:23:49.107,"Stay the fuck away from my girl, okay, man?"
01:23:49.149,01:23:51.276,Or I will straight-up end you.
01:23:51.318,01:23:52.611,Okay. All right.
01:23:52.653,01:23:53.904,"So, just back off. You got it?"
01:23:53.946,01:23:55.656,Yeah.
01:23:53.946,01:23:57.700,Because I put a ring on that and you're coming at it pretty hard with your dick.
01:23:57.741,01:24:00.118,Okay.
01:24:00.160,01:24:01.244,"Cool, okay."
01:24:01.286,01:24:03.330,"Lucy loves you, I love you."
01:24:03.372,01:24:04.999,"We're brothers, now, all right?"
01:24:05.040,01:24:08.126,"And, as such, I would like to..."
01:24:08.168,01:24:10.086,This is a big one...
01:24:10.128,01:24:12.006,to be my best man.
01:24:15.217,01:24:16.635,"I'm fucking with you, bro!"
01:24:16.677,01:24:18.345,"Of course, you can't be my best man."
01:24:18.387,01:24:19.889,You are a stranger to me.
01:24:19.930,01:24:21.473,Okay?
01:24:21.515,01:24:23.642,"Just to recap, stay the fuck away from my girl."
01:24:23.684,01:24:25.227,I don't want you to be my best man.
01:24:25.268,01:24:27.145,"We still love you, you're family."
01:24:27.187,01:24:28.689,You'll definitely be invited to the wedding.
01:24:28.731,01:24:30.106,Okay.
01:24:30.148,01:24:31.942,"But, probably not."
01:24:31.984,01:24:33.360,"I'm glad we had this talk, man."
01:24:35.404,01:24:37.197,ALL: Whoo!
01:24:39.867,01:24:40.910,Whoo!
01:24:43.245,01:24:44.246,DAVID: Uh...
01:24:45.372,01:24:47.332,You trying to hide from me?
01:24:47.374,01:24:49.960,Are you hiding from me? Hi.
01:24:50.002,01:24:52.212,"I didn't see you, right over there."
01:24:52.254,01:24:53.255,It's a good hiding spot.
01:24:54.172,01:24:56.341,"Uh, listen."
01:24:56.383,01:24:57.843,I've been thinking about you a lot.
01:24:57.885,01:24:59.845,"Look, David, I'm sorry, I..."
01:24:59.887,01:25:01.638,I can't do this.
01:25:01.680,01:25:04.349,"You made it so clear to me, that you didn't want to, so..."
01:25:04.391,01:25:06.018,That's not why I came here at all.
01:25:06.060,01:25:10.898,I just came here to apologize to you for being such an asshole.
01:25:10.940,01:25:12.024,Oh.
01:25:12.066,01:25:13.191,Yeah.
01:25:15.235,01:25:16.653,"Well, you were right about Phoebe."
01:25:16.695,01:25:18.405,"Oh, good. Did you talk to her?"
01:25:18.447,01:25:21.199,"Well, um, you know, I'm working on it."
01:25:21.241,01:25:24.327,"But, uh, are you okay?"
01:25:28.082,01:25:29.291,I'm working on it.
01:25:34.421,01:25:35.756,Happy Birthday.
01:25:50.437,01:25:52.815,See? I told you this would be fun.
01:25:52.856,01:25:56.526,"Although, I thought one of them was, like, gonna punch each other and that hasn't happened yet."
01:25:56.568,01:25:59.237,"Robin, this isn't a joke."
01:25:59.279,01:26:01.782,But you know what?
01:25:59.279,01:26:05.243,"I guess you wouldn't actually understand that, because you've never really cared about anybody enough to ever get hurt."
01:26:05.285,01:26:07.788,"So, this type of thing doesn't affect you."
01:26:07.830,01:26:11.458,"Okay. I'm sorry I invited them, but who gives a shit about me?"
01:26:11.500,01:26:13.251,"I do, because you're my friend!"
01:26:13.293,01:26:19.925,"Am I? Because as far as I can tell, you only ever want to hang out with me when you get dumped and you need someone to cheer you up."
01:26:19.967,01:26:23.595,"Well, you only ever hang out with me when you need me to be your little sidekick."
01:26:23.637,01:26:32.146,"The reason why I don't hang around with you when you're in a relationship, is because you just turn into this lame-ass shell of a human being."
01:26:32.187,01:26:33.480,Nice.
01:26:33.522,01:26:34.397,"Yeah, do you want some real advice?"
01:26:34.439,01:26:35.691,"Yeah, what?"
01:26:35.732,01:26:40.278,You're not gonna find the right guy by bumming free drinks and slutting it up.
01:26:40.320,01:26:42.031,Where is this coming from?
01:26:42.072,01:26:46.910,"This whole time, you've been the one that's like, Oh, yeah, parties and dicks and shots."
01:26:46.952,01:26:48.954,Let's put shots all over our bodies.
01:26:48.996,01:26:50.747,"More sparkles, bitch!"
01:26:50.789,01:26:55.127,It's about me being sick of you just meeting guys and falling into their dick-sand.
01:26:55.169,01:26:56.336,Falling into their what?
01:26:56.378,01:26:58.338,Their dick-sand.
01:26:58.380,01:27:07.848,"It's like, every time a guy just looks at you, you just forget who you are, and, You get sucked into their world."
01:27:07.890,01:27:15.313,"At least when I do decide I want a boyfriend, I'm gonna find someone who likes me for who I really am, because I know who the fuck that is."
01:27:59.066,01:28:00.400,Hey.
01:28:00.442,01:28:01.610,"Oh, my God."
01:28:02.402,01:28:03.987,Happy Birthday.
01:28:05.447,01:28:07.407,It's your birthday!
01:28:08.867,01:28:10.619,And I drank some of your gift.
01:28:19.586,01:28:20.879,You okay?
01:28:25.634,01:28:27.302,No. No.
01:28:34.434,01:28:36.645,"God, you look pretty when you're pissed."
01:28:45.237,01:28:47.072,I missed these.
01:28:50.659,01:28:52.244,What are we doing?
01:28:52.286,01:28:53.328,What?
01:28:54.037,01:28:56.123,God.
01:28:56.165,01:28:59.251,"So, ever since I saw you, I feel like we fucked up."
01:28:59.293,01:29:00.627,I shouldn't have let you go.
01:29:02.629,01:29:09.427,"Because Michelle and I are still together, and we're actually engaged and I feel like we're fucking up."
01:29:09.469,01:29:12.931,"We're getting married, but I don't know if I want to do it yet."
01:29:12.973,01:29:14.224,"Oh, my God."
01:29:14.266,01:29:16.893,Wait! I'm just telling...
01:29:16.935,01:29:18.520,"Oh, my God."
01:29:18.561,01:29:20.605,You just let me make out with somebody else's fiance.
01:29:20.647,01:29:23.108,"No, it's not cheating, since we've already been together."
01:29:23.150,01:29:24.943,What are you doing?
01:29:24.985,01:29:26.611,You told me you missed me!
01:29:26.653,01:29:28.947,"I... That's the whole point, I miss you all the time."
01:29:28.989,01:29:34.286,"I saw you and you were so beautiful, and you are so beautiful."
01:29:34.328,01:29:36.288,And I just need closure.
01:29:36.330,01:29:37.497,I think we need...
01:29:37.539,01:29:39.333,This is closure for you?
01:29:39.374,01:29:44.087,"Just one last screw for old times' sake, before you go and settle down with somebody else?"
01:29:46.548,01:29:49.134,"I'm sorry, all right?"
01:29:49.176,01:29:50.468,"Uh, Alice."
01:29:50.510,01:29:51.636,"No, you know, what?"
01:29:51.678,01:29:54.388,I'm sorry. This is my fault.
01:29:54.430,01:30:02.981,"I spent so much time wanting you back that, when I thought that you wanted me back, it's like I lost my mind for a second."
01:30:03.023,01:30:04.941,"Oh, my God. This is it!"
01:30:04.983,01:30:06.651,I'm falling into your dick-sand right now.
01:30:06.693,01:30:07.986,What?
01:30:08.028,01:30:09.029,"It's like quicksand, but with dicks."
01:30:09.071,01:30:10.572,I don't have dick-sand.
01:30:10.613,01:30:17.620,"I'm so obsessed with the idea of being in love, that I just, it's like..."
01:30:17.662,01:30:21.333,"Like, I forget what I want and I just disappear."
01:30:21.375,01:30:23.293,I'm like the horse in The Neverending Story.
01:30:23.335,01:30:27.089,I don't think it's coming out like it's inside your head.
01:30:27.130,01:30:29.632,Josh. I want to be alone.
01:30:31.093,01:30:32.719,I know that I've said that a lot.
01:30:34.054,01:30:39.559,"But, for the first time in my life, I really, really, truly mean it."
01:30:39.601,01:30:41.644,Congratulations on your engagement.
01:31:07.754,01:31:09.381,Where to?
01:31:09.423,01:31:10.548,Home.
01:31:12.759,01:31:14.219,I'm going home.
01:31:17.347,01:31:19.682,Woman! I don't know where the fuck you live.
01:31:19.724,01:31:23.437,"Oh, I'm sorry. Um, can I go to South Second and Berry?"
01:31:29.901,01:31:30.777,"Oh, my God!"
01:31:32.112,01:31:33.529,"Robin? Oh, my God!"
01:31:35.115,01:31:36.574,"Oh, my God! Are you okay?"
01:31:36.616,01:31:38.118,"Take us to the hospital, and I won't sue you!"
01:31:38.160,01:31:40.078,What's happening?
01:31:44.124,01:31:45.292,"Oh, God!"
01:31:45.334,01:31:46.793,"Oh, my God, it's happening."
01:31:46.835,01:31:47.919,"No, no, no. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine."
01:31:47.961,01:31:48.878,"Oh, my God!"
01:31:48.920,01:31:50.464,"I got her, I got her."
01:31:50.504,01:31:53.300,The average labor for a new mom is 26 hours.
01:31:53.342,01:31:55.760,It doesn't pop out like it does on TV.
01:31:55.802,01:31:57.095,Okay.
01:31:57.137,01:31:58.721,"Oh, my God!"
01:31:58.763,01:32:00.474,"Oh, my God, is it fine?"
01:32:00.514,01:32:01.599,Get a cab. Get me a cab.
01:32:01.641,01:32:03.059,ROBIN: I've got one!
01:32:07.481,01:32:09.732,Take us to the hospital and I won't sue you!
01:32:11.151,01:32:13.069,This is bad.
01:32:13.736,01:32:14.779,"Okay, okay."
01:32:14.821,01:32:15.864,"Oh, this is really bad!"
01:32:17.366,01:32:19.242,I need to call my patients and say sorry.
01:32:19.284,01:32:20.285,No.
01:32:21.328,01:32:22.871,This is not natural!
01:32:22.912,01:32:23.955,Okay.
01:32:23.997,01:32:28.710,"You're at 10 centimeters, and you've already entered the second phase of labor, known as active labor."
01:32:28.751,01:32:30.420,What?
01:32:30.462,01:32:32.047,I went to medical school.
01:32:32.088,01:32:33.423,BOTH: Yes!
01:32:33.465,01:32:35.133,"This is gonna happen, like, right now."
01:32:35.175,01:32:36.468,Get your foot off my tit.
01:32:36.510,01:32:38.094,"Get your foot off my tit, okay?"
01:32:38.136,01:32:39.971,It's coming.
01:32:40.013,01:32:46.144,You are the lady who's about to have a baby in the back of a taxi and I'm the Australian-American hero who's gonna make it happen!
01:32:46.186,01:32:48.104,"In the cab, though?"
01:32:48.146,01:32:51.400,My hands and my mouth have both been recently sterilized by vodka.
01:32:51.441,01:32:53.026,Feels like it's coming out.
01:32:53.068,01:32:54.361,ROBIN: I'm going in.
01:32:54.403,01:32:55.529,Chant with me!
01:32:55.569,01:32:57.364,We can do this.
01:32:57.406,01:32:59.824,We can do this.
01:32:59.866,01:33:00.950,"We can do this, we can do this."
01:33:03.370,01:33:04.871,We're here! We're here!
01:33:04.913,01:33:06.415,ALICE: Get out. Get out.
01:33:06.456,01:33:07.832,"ROBIN: Shit, the door's..."
01:33:07.874,01:33:09.125,It won't open!
01:33:09.167,01:33:10.668,It won't open!
01:33:10.710,01:33:12.921,Wait! The window's working.
01:33:12.962,01:33:15.006,ALICE: What are you doing?
01:33:15.048,01:33:16.758,Just open the door!
01:33:16.799,01:33:18.218,MEG: It's coming out!
01:33:18.260,01:33:20.762,"ALICE: Robin! Okay, you have to help her!"
01:33:20.803,01:33:22.764,You have to help her.
01:33:22.805,01:33:23.890,MEG: I can't.
01:33:23.932,01:33:25.267,Come on!
01:33:25.308,01:33:26.976,Close your legs really tight.
01:33:27.018,01:33:28.353,Do not let it come out!
01:33:30.063,01:33:31.523,"Robin, it was locked!"
01:33:32.857,01:33:34.401,Come on!
01:33:36.403,01:33:37.987,Oh! My purse.
01:33:38.029,01:33:39.781,"No, no, no, no! Get inside."
01:33:39.822,01:33:41.074,I need a...
01:33:41.116,01:33:42.742,"Jesus. Okay, don't let it come out!"
01:33:42.784,01:33:44.411,MEG: It's gonna come out.
01:33:44.453,01:33:45.828,"Wait, Meg. Meg! Meg!"
01:33:45.870,01:33:46.913,It's coming out.
01:33:46.955,01:33:47.997,Are you coming?
01:33:48.039,01:33:49.874,You don't need me anymore.
01:33:53.044,01:33:55.130,ALICE: Okay.
01:33:55.171,01:33:56.881,MEG: I'm scared.
01:34:23.074,01:34:27.245,"Look, I know you don't want me here, but just listen to me, okay?"
01:34:28.288,01:34:31.416,You like me. A lot.
01:34:31.458,01:34:33.293,And I like you.
01:34:33.335,01:34:35.920,And you're crazy.
01:34:35.962,01:34:40.049,"Honestly, I think you're probably just as crazy when you're not pregnant."
01:34:40.091,01:34:43.261,"But I'm allowed to say that, because I love you."
01:34:45.347,01:34:46.389,I love you.
01:34:50.101,01:34:51.561,I'm gonna come back later.
01:34:54.272,01:34:55.940,Thanks. Thanks for calling.
01:34:55.982,01:34:57.233,Don't be weird.
01:34:57.275,01:34:59.944,"Oh, thank you, thank..."
01:34:59.986,01:35:02.531,"Well, are you gonna come meet her or not?"
01:35:02.572,01:35:03.990,Her?
01:35:05.074,01:35:06.451,KEN: It's a her?
01:35:09.454,01:35:11.581,This is baby Madeline.
01:35:11.623,01:35:14.626,"Oh, my God, look at you."
01:35:14.668,01:35:16.461,"Happy Birthday, sweetheart."
01:35:18.129,01:35:19.548,She's beautiful.
01:35:21.090,01:35:24.969,"And I think I love you, too."
01:35:25.011,01:35:27.889,"I mean, I do love you, I don't know why I just said that."
01:35:27.930,01:35:29.474,I really love you.
01:35:29.516,01:35:32.018,"I really, really love you."
01:35:33.520,01:35:36.356,I can totally handle all of this by myself.
01:35:36.398,01:35:37.524,I'm an independent woman.
01:35:37.566,01:35:39.025,"My God, seriously?"
01:35:39.067,01:35:40.527,But I don't want to.
01:35:41.236,01:35:42.278,I don't.
01:35:48.702,01:35:49.911,Hi.
01:35:51.204,01:35:53.206,Doesn't she look like an alien?
01:35:54.790,01:35:57.544,You are the most beautiful alien in the world.
01:37:58.289,01:37:59.332,Hi.
01:38:00.166,01:38:02.126,What do you want?
01:38:02.168,01:38:05.087,I wanted to tell you that I know that I can do a lot of things on my own.
01:38:05.129,01:38:09.592,"And I can unzip my own dress, but I want you to do it for me."
01:38:09.634,01:38:12.261,That sounded really weird. Um...
01:38:12.303,01:38:14.263,I want you to watch me unzip my dress.
01:38:14.305,01:38:16.307,"No, sorry."
01:38:16.349,01:38:17.809,That's not what I meant.
01:38:17.851,01:38:24.357,"What I meant is I want to unzip my own dress and I just want you to be around, because you're my best friend."
01:38:26.192,01:38:28.319,And I love you.
01:38:28.361,01:38:31.531,"in love with you, too."
01:38:31.573,01:38:34.200,This is more than just a friendship.
01:38:34.242,01:38:36.202,I'm so glad you feel the same way.
01:38:37.746,01:38:39.080,Just joking!
01:38:39.121,01:38:40.832,"Oh, my God."
01:38:40.874,01:38:44.085,I got you.
01:38:44.126,01:38:45.754,And I missed you.
01:38:45.795,01:38:48.757,"I've been having Alice withdrawal, seriously."
01:38:52.134,01:38:54.178,"Wait, are you kidding me?"
01:38:55.555,01:39:00.560,"Robin! This is your 500 square feet, where you keep your clothes and occasionally bathe?"
01:39:01.227,01:39:02.729,"Uh, yeah."
01:39:02.771,01:39:04.689,I'm super rich.
01:39:04.731,01:39:06.858,Wait. Why do we always hang out at my place?
01:39:06.900,01:39:08.401,Why did you even work at the firm?
01:39:10.027,01:39:11.821,"Wait, why do I pay for everything all the time?"
01:39:13.239,01:39:14.741,Wow.
01:39:14.783,01:39:17.368,"Well, I didn't really need to work at the firm."
01:39:17.410,01:39:20.622,I just really liked hanging out with you.
01:39:20.663,01:39:22.707,And screwing those two security guys.
01:39:22.749,01:39:24.125,Why do have a scooter?
01:39:24.166,01:39:25.794,This is my indoor scooter.
01:39:25.835,01:39:27.712,I have the whole floor.
01:39:27.754,01:39:29.839,"I have literally paid the bill, every time we've gone out."
01:39:29.881,01:39:31.841,But that's how you stay super rich.
01:39:32.383,01:39:33.760,God!
01:39:33.802,01:39:35.136,"You have so much to learn from me, still."
01:39:35.177,01:39:36.763,I want you to be my sugar-daddy.
01:39:36.805,01:39:39.599,I'll be your sugar-sister.
01:39:39.641,01:39:41.225,I thought you didn't do breakfast?
01:39:45.814,01:39:52.570,"ALICE: I've been thinking that the time we have to be single, is really the time we have to get good at being alone."
01:39:54.363,01:39:58.284,"But, how good at being alone do we really want to be?"
01:39:58.326,01:40:05.750,"Isn't there a danger that you'll get so good at being single, so set in your ways that you'll miss out on the chance to be with somebody great?"
01:40:05.792,01:40:07.293,"Hello, hello, hello, hello."
01:40:12.632,01:40:15.927,Some people take baby steps to settle down.
01:40:22.684,01:40:24.769,Some people refuse to settle at all.
01:40:30.817,01:40:32.902,"Sometimes, it's not statistics."
01:40:33.945,01:40:36.322,It's just chemistry.
01:40:38.700,01:40:43.705,"And sometimes, just because it is over, doesn't mean the love ends."
01:40:45.999,01:40:48.918,"Um, I want to talk to you about your mom."
01:40:50.545,01:40:57.426,She got sick when you were really little and I don't talk about her because I still miss her.
01:40:58.427,01:40:59.428,Every day.
01:41:01.263,01:41:04.517,"But, we need to talk about her."
01:41:05.476,01:41:06.477,Who's that?
01:41:07.020,01:41:08.479,Me.
01:41:08.521,01:41:09.814,Who's that?
01:41:09.856,01:41:10.940,Mommy.
01:41:10.982,01:41:12.901,Yeah.
01:41:12.942,01:41:14.986,A lot of good memories in here.
01:41:19.991,01:41:21.910,I want to show you something.
01:41:39.802,01:41:42.013,The Eyes of You song.
01:41:43.681,01:41:45.892,The Eyes of You song.
01:42:14.045,01:42:15.880,PHOEBE: Now I know why you never sing.
01:42:15.922,01:42:17.339,Why?
01:42:17.381,01:42:21.343,Because your voice is so bad.
01:42:21.385,01:42:24.597,What are you talking about?
01:42:24.639,01:42:29.602,"ALICE: The thing about being single is, you should cherish it."
01:42:29.644,01:42:36.943,"Because, in a week, or a lifetime, of being alone, you may only get one moment."
01:42:41.614,01:42:46.869,"One moment, when you're not tied up in a relationship with anyone."
01:42:46.911,01:42:50.539,"A parent, a pet, a sibling, a friend."
01:43:00.049,01:43:02.844,"One moment, when you stand on your own."
01:43:07.015,01:43:09.350,"Really, truly single."
01:43:18.026,01:43:24.615,"And then, it's gone."
