00:04:15.589,00:04:16.965,"Whoa, there!"
00:04:34.900,00:04:36.568,Halt!
00:04:36.610,00:04:38.653,Who goes there?
00:04:38.695,00:04:49.164,"It is I, Arthur, Son of Uther Pendragon, from the Castle of Camelot, king of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons, sovereign of all England."
00:04:50.707,00:04:52.417,Pull the other one.
00:04:52.459,00:04:55.963,"I am, and this is my trusty servant, Patsy."
00:04:56.004,00:05:02.010,We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot.
00:05:02.052,00:05:04.596,I must speak with your lord and master.
00:05:04.638,00:05:07.474,-What? Ridden on a horse?
00:05:07.515,00:05:09.893,-You're using coconuts!
00:05:09.935,00:05:13.981,"You've got two empty halves of coconut, and you're banging them together."
00:05:14.022,00:05:18.318,So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land.
00:05:18.359,00:05:19.903,Through the Kingdom of Mercia.
00:05:19.945,00:05:21.029,Where did you get the coconuts?
00:05:22.114,00:05:23.448,We found them.
00:05:23.490,00:05:27.035,Found them? In Mercia?
00:05:27.077,00:05:28.203,What do you mean?
00:05:28.245,00:05:29.746,"Well, this is a temperate zone."
00:05:29.788,00:05:38.046,"The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land."
00:05:38.088,00:05:41.340,Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
00:05:41.382,00:05:43.844,Not at all.
00:05:43.885,00:05:46.805,What?
00:05:46.847,00:05:48.640,It could grip it by the husk.
00:05:48.682,00:05:51.392,It's not a question of where he grips it.
00:05:51.434,00:05:54.271,It's a simple question of weight ratios.
00:05:54.313,00:05:58.441,A five-ounce bird could not carry a one-pound coconut.
00:05:58.483,00:06:00.235,It doesn't matter.
00:06:00.277,00:06:05.073,Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the court of Camelot is here?
00:06:05.115,00:06:12.914,"Listen, in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right?"
00:06:12.956,00:06:15.667,-Please!
00:06:15.709,00:06:17.127,I'm not interested.
00:06:17.169,00:06:20.797,It could be carried by an African swallow.
00:06:20.839,00:06:22.841,"Oh, yes!"
00:06:22.883,00:06:25.552,Not a European swallow.
00:06:25.593,00:06:27.054,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:27.095,00:06:31.099,Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?
00:06:32.184,00:06:35.312,"But then, of course, African swallows are non-migratory."
00:06:35.354,00:06:36.771,"Oh, yes."
00:06:36.813,00:06:38.940,"So, they couldn't bring a coconut back, anyway."
00:06:38.982,00:06:43.111,Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows carried it together?
00:06:43.153,00:06:44.905,"No, they'd have to have it on a line."
00:06:44.946,00:06:48.367,Simple. They'd just use a strand of creeper.
00:06:48.407,00:06:50.744,"What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?"
00:06:50.785,00:06:51.953,"Well, why not?"
00:06:53.830,00:06:55.332,Bring out your dead!
00:06:58.793,00:07:00.337,Bring out your dead!
00:07:03.548,00:07:05.384,Bring out your dead!
00:07:08.845,00:07:10.680,Bring out your dead!
00:07:12.766,00:07:14.475,Bring out your dead!
00:07:16.561,00:07:18.605,Bring out your dead!
00:07:20.440,00:07:22.067,Bring out your dead!
00:07:24.611,00:07:26.196,Bring out your dead!
00:07:27.281,00:07:28.365,Nine pence.
00:07:30.450,00:07:32.160,Bring out your dead!
00:07:36.206,00:07:37.999,Bring out your dead!
00:07:43.546,00:07:48.176,-Bring out your dead!
00:07:48.218,00:07:50.511,-Bring out your dead!
00:07:50.553,00:07:51.679,Nine pence.
00:07:51.721,00:07:53.390,-I'm not dead!
00:07:53.432,00:07:54.557,Nothing.
00:07:54.599,00:07:56.143,I'm not dead!
00:07:56.184,00:07:58.437,-Here. He says he's not dead.
00:07:58.478,00:08:00.021,-I'm not!
00:08:00.063,00:08:01.522,He will be soon.
00:08:01.564,00:08:03.233,I'm getting better!
00:08:03.275,00:08:05.110,"No, you're not. You'll be stone dead in a moment."
00:08:05.152,00:08:07.321,I can't take him like that.
00:08:07.362,00:08:09.323,I don't want to go on the cart.
00:08:09.364,00:08:10.698,Don't be such a baby.
00:08:10.740,00:08:12.951,-I can't take him.
00:08:12.993,00:08:15.036,"-Well, do us a favor."
00:08:15.078,00:08:17.747,Can you hang around a couple of minutes? He won't be long.
00:08:17.789,00:08:20.541,Got to go to the Robinsons'.
00:08:20.583,00:08:22.502,-When's your next round?
00:08:22.543,00:08:23.962,I think I'll go for a walk.
00:08:24.004,00:08:25.588,"You're not fooling anyone, you know."
00:08:25.630,00:08:27.548,"Look, isn't there something you can do?"
00:08:27.590,00:08:32.137,I feel happy!
00:08:32.179,00:08:33.972,-Thanks very much.
00:08:34.014,00:08:35.723,Not at all.
00:08:35.765,00:08:36.891,Right.
00:08:40.728,00:08:44.024,"-Who's that, then?"
00:08:44.065,00:08:45.150,Why?
00:08:45.192,00:08:46.567,He hasn't got shit all over him.
00:09:10.550,00:09:12.469,-Old woman!
00:09:12.511,00:09:16.056,"Man, sorry. What knight lives in that castle over there?"
00:09:16.097,00:09:18.558,-I'm 37.
00:09:18.599,00:09:22.562,-I'm 37. I'm not old.
00:09:22.603,00:09:23.980,You could say Dennis.
00:09:24.022,00:09:25.565,I didn't know you were called Dennis.
00:09:25.606,00:09:27.442,"Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?"
00:09:27.484,00:09:33.573,"I did say sorry about the old woman, but from behind-- What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior."
00:09:33.614,00:09:36.410,"-Well, I am king."
00:09:36.451,00:09:40.288,How did you get that?
00:09:40.330,00:09:46.836,By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society!
00:09:46.878,00:09:52.008,"If there's ever going to be any progress-- Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here. Ooh."
00:09:52.050,00:09:53.760,How do you do?
00:09:53.801,00:09:57.055,"How do you do, good lady? I am Arthur, King of the Britons."
00:09:57.097,00:09:59.015,-Whose castle is that?
00:09:59.057,00:10:01.101,-The Britons.
00:10:01.142,00:10:04.604,We all are. We're all Britons.
00:10:04.645,00:10:06.606,Didn't know we had a king.
00:10:06.647,00:10:08.442,I thought we were an autonomous collective.
00:10:08.483,00:10:11.611,You're fooling yourself.
00:10:11.652,00:10:17.409,A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working class-- There you go!
00:10:17.451,00:10:19.453,That's what it's all about.
00:10:17.451,00:10:22.539,"If only people-- Please! Please, good people."
00:10:22.581,00:10:24.791,Who lives in that castle?
00:10:24.832,00:10:26.834,-No one lives there.
00:10:26.876,00:10:28.962,-We don't have a lord.
00:10:29.003,00:10:32.424,I told you. We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.
00:10:32.466,00:10:35.885,We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
00:10:35.927,00:10:37.262,Yes.
00:10:37.304,00:10:40.640,But all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting.
00:10:40.681,00:10:42.476,"Yes, I see."
00:10:42.517,00:10:44.394,By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
00:10:44.436,00:10:45.645,Be quiet!
00:10:45.686,00:10:49.857,By a two-thirds majority in the case of-- Be quiet!
00:10:49.899,00:10:52.026,Order?
00:10:52.068,00:10:54.946,-I am your king!
00:10:54.988,00:10:58.866,-You don't vote for kings.
00:10:58.908,00:11:12.964,"The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying, by divine providence, that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur."
00:11:13.006,00:11:14.841,That is why I'm your king!
00:11:14.882,00:11:22.599,"Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords, is no basis for a system of government."
00:11:19.220,00:11:24.351,Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses.
00:11:24.392,00:11:26.978,Not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
00:11:27.020,00:11:28.855,Be quiet!
00:11:28.896,00:11:34.068,You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you.
00:11:34.110,00:11:35.736,Shut up!
00:11:35.778,00:11:41.951,"I mean, if I went around saying I was an emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!"
00:11:41.993,00:11:43.786,Shut up!
00:11:43.828,00:11:46.331,Now we see the violence inherent in the system.
00:11:46.373,00:11:47.874,Shut up!
00:11:47.915,00:11:49.959,Come and see the violence inherent in the system!
00:11:50.001,00:11:53.087,"-Help, I'm being repressed!"
00:11:53.129,00:11:55.590,What a giveaway.
00:11:55.632,00:11:57.592,That's what I'm on about.
00:11:57.634,00:11:58.593,You saw it didn't you?
00:13:35.523,00:13:37.942,"You fight with the strength of many men, Sir Knight."
00:13:41.780,00:13:44.115,"I am Arthur, King of the Britons."
00:13:48.244,00:13:53.040,I seek the finest and the bravest knights in the land to join me in my court at Camelot.
00:13:58.171,00:14:01.591,You have proved yourself worthy.
00:14:07.180,00:14:10.642,You make me sad.
00:14:10.684,00:14:12.310,None shall pass.
00:14:12.352,00:14:14.813,-What?
00:14:14.853,00:14:19.066,"I have no quarrel with you, good Sir Knight, but I must cross this bridge."
00:14:19.108,00:14:21.653,Then you shall die.
00:14:21.695,00:14:26.533,"I command you, as King of the Britons, to stand aside."
00:14:26.574,00:14:30.578,I move for no man.
00:14:31.871,00:14:33.164,So be it!
00:14:59.899,00:15:01.984,"Now, stand aside, worthy adversary."
00:15:02.026,00:15:05.363,-'Tis but a scratch.
00:15:05.405,00:15:07.281,"-No, it isn't."
00:15:08.867,00:15:10.410,-I've had worse.
00:15:10.451,00:15:12.036,"Come on, you pansy!"
00:15:20.127,00:15:21.504,Victory is mine.
00:15:23.297,00:15:28.720,"We thank thee, Lord, that in thy-- -Come on, then."
00:15:28.762,00:15:29.888,Have at you.
00:15:31.598,00:15:36.644,"You are indeed brave, Sir Knight, -but the fight is mine."
00:15:36.686,00:15:39.355,"Look, you stupid bastard!"
00:15:39.397,00:15:41.274,"-Yes, I have."
00:15:41.315,00:15:43.860,Just a flesh wound.
00:15:43.902,00:15:46.320,"-Look, stop that."
00:15:46.362,00:15:48.865,I'll have your leg. Right!
00:15:51.701,00:15:54.161,-Right! I'll do you for that.
00:15:54.203,00:15:55.622,Come here.
00:15:55.663,00:15:57.081,What are you going to do?
00:15:57.123,00:16:00.084,-I am invincible!
00:16:00.126,00:16:04.338,The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
00:16:05.423,00:16:06.674,"Come on, then."
00:16:11.888,00:16:14.766,"All right, we'll call it a draw."
00:16:14.808,00:16:17.894,"-Come, Patsy."
00:16:17.936,00:16:21.481,"Running away, eh?"
00:16:21.522,00:16:24.275,Come back here and take what's coming to you!
00:16:24.317,00:16:25.902,I'll bite your legs off!
00:17:03.439,00:17:05.775,-A witch!
00:17:07.026,00:17:09.821,-We got a witch!
00:17:12.490,00:17:14.074,We've got a witch!
00:17:16.035,00:17:17.453,Burn her! Burn her!
00:17:26.086,00:17:28.006,We have found a witch.
00:17:28.047,00:17:31.384,Burn her! Burn her!
00:17:31.425,00:17:33.302,How do you know she is a witch?
00:17:33.344,00:17:34.888,She looks like one.
00:17:36.597,00:17:38.766,Bring her forward.
00:17:38.808,00:17:43.563,-I am not a witch.
00:17:43.604,00:17:46.440,-They dressed me up like this.
00:17:46.482,00:17:48.776,And this isn't my nose.
00:17:52.613,00:17:55.742,-Well?
00:17:55.783,00:17:56.993,The nose?
00:17:57.035,00:17:58.995,And the hat.
00:17:59.037,00:18:02.832,Burn her! Burn her!
00:18:02.874,00:18:04.333,Did you dress her up like this?
00:18:04.375,00:18:06.836,-No! No!
00:18:06.878,00:18:08.295,-Yes. Yes.
00:18:08.337,00:18:10.631,-A bit. She has got a wart.
00:18:12.132,00:18:14.176,What makes you think she is a witch?
00:18:14.218,00:18:16.136,"Well, she turned me into a newt."
00:18:17.680,00:18:18.598,A newt?
00:18:23.102,00:18:24.478,I got better.
00:18:24.520,00:18:27.189,-Burn her anyway.
00:18:30.902,00:18:36.115,Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
00:18:36.156,00:18:38.785,Are there? What are they?
00:18:38.826,00:18:40.453,Do they hurt?
00:18:40.494,00:18:43.414,"Tell me, what do you do with witches?"
00:18:43.456,00:18:46.417,Burn them! Burn them!
00:18:46.459,00:18:49.169,And what do you burn apart from witches?
00:18:49.211,00:18:50.713,More witches!
00:18:52.048,00:18:55.593,-Wood.
00:19:07.021,00:19:09.273,-'Cause they're made of wood?
00:19:11.609,00:19:14.821,"So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?"
00:19:15.863,00:19:17.364,Build a bridge out of her.
00:19:17.406,00:19:21.119,"Ah, but can you not also make bridges out of stone?"
00:19:22.202,00:19:23.287,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:24.330,00:19:27.041,Does wood sink in water?
00:19:27.083,00:19:29.585,-No.
00:19:29.627,00:19:30.837,Throw her into the pond!
00:19:34.340,00:19:38.427,-What also floats in water?
00:19:38.469,00:19:40.513,-Apples.
00:19:40.554,00:19:43.641,-Cider. Cherries.
00:19:43.683,00:19:45.810,-Churches.
00:19:45.852,00:19:46.894,A duck!
00:19:49.396,00:19:50.690,Exactly.
00:19:52.232,00:19:54.193,"So, logically..."
00:19:54.234,00:19:56.863,If she...
00:19:56.904,00:19:59.157,weighs the same as a duck...
00:20:01.659,00:20:03.119,she's made of wood.
00:20:03.161,00:20:04.578,"And, therefore..."
00:20:06.998,00:20:08.749,-A witch!
00:20:13.212,00:20:15.339,We shall use my largest scales.
00:20:35.609,00:20:39.655,Right. Remove the supports!
00:20:44.368,00:20:46.453,-A witch!
00:20:46.495,00:20:49.082,-It's a fair cop.
00:20:56.338,00:20:59.675,"Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of science?"
00:20:59.717,00:21:02.595,"I am Arthur, King of the Britons."
00:21:02.636,00:21:04.304,My liege.
00:21:04.346,00:21:09.936,"Good Sir Knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join us at the Round Table?"
00:21:09.977,00:21:12.605,"My liege, I would be honored."
00:21:12.646,00:21:15.649,-What is your name?
00:21:15.691,00:21:21.614,"Then I dub you Sir Bedevere, knight of the Round Table."
00:21:21.655,00:21:26.535,was the first to join King Arthur's knights.
00:21:26.577,00:21:29.956,But other illustrious names were soon to follow.
00:21:29.997,00:21:31.749,Sir Lancelot the Brave.
00:21:32.792,00:21:35.211,Sir Galahad the Pure.
00:21:35.253,00:21:47.807,"And Sir Robin, the Not-quite- so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol, and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill."
00:21:47.848,00:21:51.351,And the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.
00:21:52.770,00:21:58.442,Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries.
00:21:58.484,00:22:01.112,The Knights of the Round Table.
00:22:01.154,00:22:05.032,"That, my liege, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped."
00:22:05.074,00:22:07.576,"This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere."
00:22:07.618,00:22:11.497,Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
00:22:11.538,00:22:13.582,"-Certainly, sir."
00:22:17.336,00:22:18.462,-Camelot.
00:22:18.504,00:22:19.755,-Camelot.
00:22:19.797,00:22:21.507,-Camelot.
00:22:21.548,00:22:23.342,Shh.
00:22:23.383,00:22:26.262,"Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home."
00:22:26.304,00:22:28.764,Let us ride to Camelot!
00:23:34.580,00:23:37.415,"No, on second thoughts, let's not go to Camelot."
00:23:37.457,00:23:39.459,-It is a silly place.
00:23:52.306,00:23:54.308,King of the Britons.
00:23:56.434,00:23:59.980,"Oh, don't grovel. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people groveling."
00:24:00.022,00:24:01.774,-Sorry.
00:24:01.815,00:24:07.238,"Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this, and, forgive me that, and, I'm not worthy."
00:24:07.280,00:24:10.283,-What are you doing now?
00:24:10.324,00:24:15.079,Don't. It's like those miserable psalms. They're so depressing.
00:24:15.121,00:24:16.914,"-Now, knock it off!"
00:24:16.956,00:24:21.001,Right.
00:24:21.043,00:24:26.340,Your knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times.
00:24:26.382,00:24:29.927,"-Good idea, Oh Lord!"
00:24:29.969,00:24:33.597,"Behold, Arthur, this is the Holy Grail."
00:24:33.639,00:24:38.936,"Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek this Grail."
00:24:38.978,00:24:42.106,"That is your purpose, Arthur."
00:24:42.148,00:24:44.900,The quest for the Holy Grail.
00:24:48.946,00:24:53.117,-A blessing from the Lord.
00:25:50.841,00:25:52.134,Halt!
00:26:02.936,00:26:04.438,Hello!
00:26:12.238,00:26:13.489,Hello!
00:26:15.074,00:26:16.825,Hello. Who is it?
00:26:16.867,00:26:20.620,"It is King Arthur, and these are my knights of the Round Table."
00:26:20.662,00:26:22.206,Whose castle is this?
00:26:22.248,00:26:25.709,"This is the castle of my master, Guy de Loimbard."
00:26:25.751,00:26:31.757,Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest.
00:26:31.798,00:26:38.222,"If he will give us food and shelter for the night, he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail."
00:26:38.264,00:26:41.641,"Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen."
00:26:41.683,00:26:43.810,"He's already got one, you see."
00:26:44.937,00:26:46.230,What?
00:26:46.272,00:26:48.732,He says they've already got one!
00:26:48.774,00:26:52.861,-Are you sure he's got one?
00:26:52.903,00:26:55.281,I told him we've already got one.
00:26:56.823,00:27:00.286,Well...
00:27:00.327,00:27:03.205,Of course not!
00:27:04.706,00:27:07.000,"-Well, what are you then?"
00:27:07.042,00:27:11.130,"Why do you think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king?"
00:27:11.171,00:27:14.300,-What are you doing in England?
00:27:16.427,00:27:20.222,"If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force."
00:27:20.264,00:27:23.976,"You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!"
00:27:24.017,00:27:28.188,"Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person."
00:27:28.230,00:27:32.234,"I blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King."
00:27:32.276,00:27:36.738,You and all your silly English k... nights.
00:27:43.287,00:27:46.832,-What a strange person.
00:27:43.287,00:27:53.046,"-Now look here, my good man-- I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed, animal food-trough wiper."
00:27:53.088,00:27:56.342,I fart in your general direction.
00:27:56.383,00:28:01.597,"Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries."
00:28:03.474,00:28:06.059,Is there someone else up there we could talk to?
00:28:06.101,00:28:10.147,"No. Now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time."
00:28:12.566,00:28:13.900,"Now, this is your last chance."
00:28:13.942,00:28:15.777,I've been more than reasonable...
00:28:15.819,00:28:17.695,-Fetchez la vache!
00:28:17.737,00:28:18.780,Fetchez la vache!
00:28:21.659,00:28:27.873,"If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall-- Jesus Christ!"
00:28:29.749,00:28:31.251,-Crikey!
00:28:33.045,00:28:35.922,Right! Charge!
00:28:50.020,00:28:52.565,Run away! Run away!
00:29:03.075,00:29:05.536,-Fiends! I'll tear them apart.
00:29:05.578,00:29:08.914,"Sir, I have a plan, sir."
00:31:12.663,00:31:14.331,What happens now?
00:31:14.373,00:31:23.882,"Well, now, Lancelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall, and then leap out of the rabbit, taking the French by surprise."
00:31:23.923,00:31:26.677,"Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!"
00:31:27.761,00:31:29.805,Who leaps out?
00:31:29.847,00:31:32.098,"Lancelot, Galahad, and I..."
00:31:33.392,00:31:36.520,leap out of the rabbit...
00:31:40.065,00:31:44.152,"Um... Look. If we built this large, wooden badger..."
00:31:48.198,00:31:49.324,Run away!
00:31:59.501,00:32:03.338,History for Schools.
00:32:03.380,00:32:07.467,Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur.
00:32:07.509,00:32:12.305,The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise.
00:32:12.347,00:32:21.314,And Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion.
00:32:21.356,00:32:29.197,"Arthur, having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually."
00:32:29.239,00:32:31.074,"Now, this is what they did."
00:32:34.327,00:32:35.579,Frank!
00:32:43.670,00:32:46.423,The tale of Sir Robin.
00:32:46.465,00:32:50.135,"So, each of the knights went their separate ways."
00:32:50.176,00:32:57.517,"Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels."
00:33:40.811,00:33:44.022,"That's enough music for now, lads."
00:33:44.063,00:33:46.107,Looks like there's dirty work afoot.
00:33:48.694,00:33:51.613,Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.
00:33:51.655,00:33:55.116,"Dennis, forget about freedom."
00:33:58.704,00:34:01.206,Halt! Who art thou?
00:34:01.247,00:34:04.083,He is brave Sir Robin Brave Sir Robin...
00:34:04.125,00:34:05.627,Shut up!
00:34:05.669,00:34:09.840,"Um... nobody, really."
00:34:09.882,00:34:11.049,What do you want?
00:34:11.090,00:34:14.093,-To fight and-- -Shut up!
00:34:14.135,00:34:16.346,"Um, ooh, nothing."
00:34:16.388,00:34:19.474,"Just to pass through, good Sir Knight."
00:34:19.516,00:34:21.059,I'm afraid not.
00:34:21.100,00:34:25.313,"Ah. Well, actually, I am a knight of the Round Table."
00:34:25.355,00:34:27.816,You're a knight of the Round Table?
00:34:27.858,00:34:29.484,I am.
00:34:29.526,00:34:30.777,"In that case, I shall have to kill you."
00:34:30.819,00:34:32.195,Shall I?
00:34:32.237,00:34:33.822,-I don't think so.
00:34:33.864,00:34:35.782,"-I think, kill him."
00:34:35.824,00:34:36.867,"-Oh, shut up."
00:34:36.909,00:34:38.535,And you!
00:34:38.577,00:34:40.078,Get the sword out.
00:34:40.119,00:34:43.040,-Cut your own head off.
00:34:43.081,00:34:45.124,-What?
00:34:45.166,00:34:46.668,You're lucky you're not next to him.
00:34:46.710,00:34:48.003,What do you mean?
00:34:48.045,00:34:50.213,-You snore.
00:34:50.255,00:34:51.924,"Anyway, you've got bad breath."
00:34:51.965,00:34:53.508,"Well, it's only because you don't brush my teeth."
00:34:53.550,00:34:55.969,"Oh, stop bitching, and let's go and have tea!"
00:34:56.011,00:35:00.181,"All right! We'll kill him first, and then have tea and biscuits."
00:35:00.223,00:35:01.808,-Yes.
00:35:01.850,00:35:04.895,All right! Not biscuits.
00:35:04.937,00:35:05.771,Right.
00:35:08.857,00:35:11.109,-He's buggered off!
00:35:12.778,00:35:13.862,No!
00:35:15.781,00:35:17.657,I didn't.
00:35:19.701,00:35:21.828,-No!
00:35:23.830,00:35:25.916,-I didn't!
00:35:25.958,00:35:27.834,-I never did!
00:35:27.876,00:35:30.003,-Ooh lies!
00:35:32.047,00:35:33.172,I never!
00:35:54.069,00:35:54.987,Wee!
00:35:59.282,00:36:00.450,Ooh ooh.
00:36:03.954,00:36:07.332,of Sir Galahad.
00:37:00.635,00:37:05.057,Open the door!
00:37:05.098,00:37:08.267,"In the name of King Arthur, open the door!"
00:37:17.360,00:37:19.112,Hello!
00:37:19.154,00:37:22.908,"Welcome, gentle Sir Knight."
00:37:24.076,00:37:27.245,-The Castle Anthrax?
00:37:27.286,00:37:29.414,"It's not a very good name, is it?"
00:37:29.455,00:37:34.169,"Oh, but we are nice, and we will attend to your every, every need!"
00:37:34.211,00:37:36.880,You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
00:37:36.922,00:37:39.841,-The what?
00:37:39.883,00:37:44.221,"Oh, but you are tired, and you must rest awhile."
00:37:44.262,00:37:45.889,Midget! Crapper!
00:37:45.931,00:37:48.934,"-Yes, O Zoot?"
00:37:48.975,00:37:52.187,"-Oh thank you, Zoot."
00:37:52.229,00:37:54.773,"Away, away, varletesses!"
00:37:54.814,00:38:00.237,"The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big."
00:38:00.278,00:38:03.281,"Well, look, I-- What is your name, handsome knight?"
00:38:03.322,00:38:05.617,Sir Galahad the Chaste.
00:38:06.659,00:38:10.496,Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot.
00:38:10.538,00:38:12.124,"Oh, but come."
00:38:12.165,00:38:14.793,"No! Please, in God's name, show me the Grail."
00:38:14.834,00:38:18.630,"Oh, you have suffered much."
00:38:18.671,00:38:19.923,"Look, I have seen it."
00:38:19.965,00:38:21.674,Sir Galahad!
00:38:21.716,00:38:25.428,You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.
00:38:26.471,00:38:28.265,"Well, I..."
00:38:28.306,00:38:34.646,"Oh, I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet, compared to yours."
00:38:34.687,00:38:43.321,"We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between 16 and 19 and a half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us."
00:38:43.362,00:38:46.449,"Oh, it is a lonely life."
00:38:46.491,00:38:51.579,"Bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear."
00:38:53.206,00:38:56.042,We are just not used to handsome knights.
00:38:56.084,00:38:59.921,Nay. Come. You may lie here.
00:38:59.963,00:39:03.424,"-Oh, but you are wounded!"
00:39:03.466,00:39:08.305,"You must see the doctors immediately. Please, lie down."
00:39:11.474,00:39:13.643,"Well, what seems to be the trouble?"
00:39:13.685,00:39:15.561,They're doctors?
00:39:15.603,00:39:18.982,"Uh, they have a basic medical training, yes."
00:39:19.024,00:39:22.360,"Oh, come, come, you must try to rest."
00:39:22.401,00:39:25.488,Dr. Piglet! Dr. Winston!
00:39:33.038,00:39:34.455,Try to relax.
00:39:34.497,00:39:35.874,Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?
00:39:35.915,00:39:37.750,We must examine you.
00:39:40.753,00:39:41.880,There's nothing wrong with that.
00:39:41.921,00:39:44.132,Please. We are doctors.
00:39:46.343,00:39:48.553,"Look, this cannot be!"
00:39:48.594,00:39:50.972,-I am sworn to chastity!
00:39:51.014,00:39:53.975,Torment me no longer.
00:39:54.017,00:39:57.020,-There's no Grail here.
00:39:58.104,00:40:00.857,-I have seen-- Oh.
00:40:05.444,00:40:07.072,Hello.
00:40:26.424,00:40:27.884,Zoot!
00:40:27.926,00:40:30.387,"No. I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo."
00:40:30.428,00:40:34.224,"Oh, but excuse me-- -Where are you going?"
00:40:34.266,00:40:37.476,I have seen it here in this castle!
00:40:37.518,00:40:40.563,"No! Oh, no!"
00:40:40.605,00:40:42.190,"Bad, bad, Zoot!"
00:40:42.232,00:40:46.027,-What is it?
00:40:46.069,00:40:50.615,"She has been setting light to our beacon, which, I've just remembered, is Grail-shaped."
00:40:50.656,00:40:53.118,It's not the first time we've had this problem.
00:40:53.159,00:40:55.120,It's not the real Grail?
00:40:55.161,00:40:58.123,"Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot."
00:40:58.164,00:41:01.500,"She is a bad person, and must pay the penalty."
00:41:03.211,00:41:05.463,Do you think this scene should have been cut?
00:41:05.504,00:41:08.466,We were so worried when the boys were writing it.
00:41:08.507,00:41:10.218,But now we're glad.
00:41:10.260,00:41:12.053,"It's better than some of the previous scenes, I think."
00:41:12.095,00:41:13.805,At least ours was better visually.
00:41:13.846,00:41:15.223,At least ours was committed.
00:41:15.265,00:41:16.641,It wasn't just a string of pussy jokes.
00:41:16.682,00:41:19.436,-Get on with it.
00:41:19.477,00:41:22.272,Get on with it!
00:41:22.314,00:41:26.484,-I am enjoying this scene.
00:41:29.779,00:41:31.823,"Oh, wicked, wicked Zoot!"
00:41:34.367,00:41:36.202,She must pay the penalty.
00:41:36.244,00:41:41.582,"And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the Grail-shaped beacon."
00:41:41.624,00:41:44.752,"You must tie her down on a bed, and spank her."
00:41:44.794,00:41:47.046,A spanking!
00:41:47.088,00:41:51.050,"You must spank her well, and after you've spanked her, you may deal with her as you like."
00:41:51.092,00:41:53.470,"-And, then, spank me."
00:41:53.511,00:41:54.971,-And me.
00:41:55.013,00:41:57.349,Yes. You must give us all a good spanking!
00:41:57.390,00:41:58.850,A spanking! A spanking!
00:42:01.019,00:42:03.480,"And, after the spanking, the oral sex."
00:42:03.521,00:42:06.858,The oral sex!
00:42:06.899,00:42:09.110,"Well, I could stay a bit longer."
00:42:09.152,00:42:11.321,-Sir Galahad!
00:42:11.363,00:42:13.739,-Quick! You are in great peril.
00:42:13.781,00:42:16.201,"-No, he isn't!"
00:42:16.242,00:42:18.536,-She's got a point.
00:42:18.577,00:42:21.456,"-Look, I'm fine!"
00:42:21.498,00:42:22.957,I can tackle this lot single-handed!
00:42:22.999,00:42:25.460,"Yes, let him tackle us single-handed!"
00:42:26.752,00:42:28.421,"No, Sir Galahad. Come!"
00:42:28.463,00:42:30.631,"No, really. I can cope."
00:42:30.673,00:42:33.385,"-Yes, let him handle us easily."
00:42:33.426,00:42:36.846,Wait! Please! I can defeat them!
00:42:36.888,00:42:40.016,Yes! He'll beat us easily.
00:42:44.145,00:42:45.688,"Oh, shit!"
00:42:45.730,00:42:48.607,-You were in great peril.
00:42:48.649,00:42:50.318,"Yes, you were."
00:42:50.360,00:42:52.195,"Look, let me go back in there and face the peril."
00:42:52.237,00:42:54.030,"No, it's too perilous."
00:42:54.072,00:42:55.781,It's my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can.
00:42:55.823,00:42:57.616,"No, we've got to find the Holy Grail. Come on!"
00:42:57.658,00:42:59.035,Let me have just a little bit of peril?
00:42:59.077,00:43:00.495,No. It's unhealthy.
00:43:00.537,00:43:02.621,-I bet you're gay.
00:43:04.207,00:43:08.127,had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation.
00:43:08.169,00:43:10.963,"But, they were still no nearer the Grail."
00:43:11.005,00:43:17.595,"Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something."
00:43:17.636,00:43:20.306,"That's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously."
00:43:20.348,00:43:22.808,They were more than two laden swallow's flights away.
00:43:22.850,00:43:25.228,"Four, if they had a coconut on a line between them."
00:43:25.270,00:43:29.315,"I mean, If the birds were-- Get on with it!"
00:43:29.357,00:43:36.364,"Oh, anyway, on to Scene 24, which is a smashing scene, with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue."
00:43:36.406,00:43:44.705,"There aren't any swallows, but I think you can hear a st-- And this enchanter of whom you speak, he has seen the Grail?"
00:43:49.752,00:43:51.504,Where does he live?
00:43:51.546,00:43:54.340,"Old man, where does he live?"
00:43:54.382,00:43:59.304,He knows of a cave.
00:43:59.345,00:44:01.889,And the Grail.
00:44:01.931,00:44:03.808,There is much danger.
00:44:03.849,00:44:11.357,"For beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril, which no man has ever crossed."
00:44:11.399,00:44:13.901,But the Grail.
00:44:13.943,00:44:17.696,Seek you the Bridge of Death.
00:44:19.240,00:44:21.367,The Bridge of Death which leads to the Grail?
00:45:04.035,00:45:07.455,Ni! Ni! Ni!
00:45:07.497,00:45:08.665,Who are you?
00:45:08.705,00:45:11.708,We are the knights who say Ni!
00:45:11.750,00:45:13.461,No! Not the knights who say Ni?
00:45:13.503,00:45:15.588,-The same!
00:45:15.630,00:45:19.175,We are the keepers of the sacred words.
00:45:19.217,00:45:23.720,"Ni, Peng, and Neee Wom!"
00:45:23.762,00:45:25.890,Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale.
00:45:25.931,00:45:30.520,The knights who say Ni demand a sacrifice.
00:45:30.562,00:45:35.066,"Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods."
00:45:35.107,00:45:40.613,-Ni! Ni! Ni!
00:45:42.990,00:45:47.786,"We shall say Ni again to you, if you do not appease us."
00:45:47.828,00:45:50.582,-What is it you want?
00:45:52.542,00:45:53.459,a shrubbery.
00:45:54.919,00:45:55.961,A what?
00:45:56.003,00:45:58.548,-Ni! Ni! Ni!
00:45:58.590,00:46:01.593,Please! Please! No more!
00:46:01.634,00:46:07.139,"You must return with a shrubbery, or else you will never pass through this wood..."
00:46:08.224,00:46:10.101,alive.
00:46:10.142,00:46:12.311,"Knights of Ni, you are just and fair."
00:46:12.353,00:46:14.939,-We will return with a shrubbery.
00:46:14.980,00:46:17.066,-Of course.
00:46:17.108,00:46:19.902,-Yes.
00:46:19.944,00:46:21.070,go!
00:46:31.497,00:46:34.166,-Oh! God!
00:46:34.208,00:46:37.503,-Hm. Hm!
00:47:04.530,00:47:07.241,Stop that!
00:47:07.283,00:47:10.244,"Go on, clear off!"
00:47:10.286,00:47:11.704,Do it! Go away!
00:47:12.955,00:47:15.040,"And you, clear off!"
00:47:18.419,00:47:21.506,-Huh. Bloody weather.
00:47:21.547,00:47:23.466,of Sir Lancelot.
00:47:29.888,00:47:33.184,"One day, lad, all this will be yours."
00:47:33.225,00:47:35.812,"-What, the curtains?"
00:47:35.852,00:47:40.316,"All that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land."
00:47:40.358,00:47:42.234,"That'll be your kingdom, lad."
00:47:42.276,00:47:44.153,"-But, Mother."
00:47:44.195,00:47:46.656,"But, Father, I don't want any of that."
00:47:46.698,00:47:47.906,"Listen, lad."
00:47:47.948,00:47:50.493,I built this kingdom up from nothing.
00:47:50.535,00:47:53.245,"When I started here, all there was was a swamp."
00:47:53.287,00:47:56.415,Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp.
00:47:56.457,00:48:00.002,"But I built it all the same, just to show them."
00:48:00.044,00:48:03.255,It sank into the swamp.
00:48:03.297,00:48:04.841,That sank into the swamp.
00:48:04.881,00:48:06.967,"So, I built a third one."
00:48:04.881,00:48:08.845,"That burned down, fell over, then sank in the swamp."
00:48:08.885,00:48:11.597,But the fourth one stayed up.
00:48:11.639,00:48:13.808,"And that's what you're gonna get, lad."
00:48:13.850,00:48:16.602,The strongest castle in these isles.
00:48:16.644,00:48:19.146,But I don't want any of that.
00:48:19.188,00:48:20.732,-I'd rather-- -Rather what?
00:48:20.773,00:48:24.235,-I'd rather just...
00:48:24.276,00:48:27.154,-Sing!
00:48:27.196,00:48:29.198,-You're not going into a song while I'm here!
00:48:29.240,00:48:30.742,"Now, listen, lad."
00:48:30.783,00:48:36.664,"In 20 minutes, you're getting married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain."
00:48:36.706,00:48:39.500,-But I don't want land.
00:48:39.542,00:48:41.210,-Herbert.
00:48:41.252,00:48:45.089,"We live on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get."
00:48:45.130,00:48:48.676,-But I don't like her.
00:48:48.718,00:48:50.511,What's wrong with her?
00:48:50.553,00:48:55.349,"She's beautiful, she's rich."
00:48:55.391,00:48:57.810,tracts of land.
00:48:57.852,00:49:03.691,"I know, but I want the girl that I marry to have..."
00:49:03.733,00:49:07.904,-A certain special something.
00:49:07.944,00:49:10.072,Cut that out! Cut that out!
00:49:11.574,00:49:16.788,"You're marrying Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea!"
00:49:16.829,00:49:18.205,Guards!
00:49:18.247,00:49:22.585,Make sure the prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
00:49:22.627,00:49:24.961,"Not to leave the room, even if you come and get him."
00:49:25.003,00:49:27.590,-No. Until I come and get him.
00:49:27.632,00:49:30.927,"Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room."
00:49:30.967,00:49:36.056,"No, you stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave."
00:49:36.098,00:49:38.726,-And you'll come and get him.
00:49:38.768,00:49:42.647,"We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room."
00:49:42.688,00:49:46.066,-No. Leaving the room.
00:49:46.108,00:49:48.193,-All right?
00:49:48.235,00:49:51.322,-lf we're...
00:49:51.363,00:49:54.492,-If...
00:49:54.533,00:49:58.830,You just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
00:49:59.996,00:50:01.582,-All right?
00:50:01.624,00:50:05.001,"-Oh, I remember."
00:50:05.043,00:50:11.216,"No, you just keep him in here, and make sure-- Yes! We'll keep him in here, obviously."
00:50:11.258,00:50:14.762,But if he had to leave and we were with him-- No. Keep just him in here!
00:50:14.804,00:50:17.389,"-Until you, or anyone else-- -Not anyone, just me."
00:50:17.431,00:50:20.058,-Just you... get back.
00:50:20.100,00:50:21.393,-Right?
00:50:21.435,00:50:23.228,We'll stay here until you get back.
00:50:23.270,00:50:25.690,-And make sure he doesn't leave.
00:50:27.441,00:50:30.611,-Make sure he doesn't leave.
00:50:30.653,00:50:32.404,"Yes, make sure he doesn't leave."
00:50:32.446,00:50:35.658,"Oh, yes, of course!"
00:50:35.700,00:50:39.787,It seemed a bit daft me having to guard him when he's a guard.
00:50:39.829,00:50:42.832,-Is that clear?
00:50:42.874,00:50:43.958,Right.
00:50:46.084,00:50:48.713,-Where are you going?
00:50:48.754,00:50:53.425,"No, I want you to stay here, and make sure he doesn't leave."
00:50:53.467,00:50:55.469,"I see, right."
00:50:55.511,00:50:57.013,"But, Father..."
00:50:57.053,00:50:59.139,"Shut your noise, you, and get that suit on."
00:51:06.397,00:51:08.190,-And no singing!
00:51:08.232,00:51:10.735,-Go and get a glass of water.
00:51:59.867,00:52:02.536,"-Well taken, Concorde!"
00:52:02.578,00:52:04.329,And again!
00:52:04.371,00:52:07.541,"Over we go! Good, steady!"
00:52:07.583,00:52:09.376,"Now, the big one!"
00:52:10.628,00:52:12.088,"Come on, Concorde!"
00:52:13.338,00:52:15.215,"Message for you, sir."
00:52:17.426,00:52:19.845,Concorde!
00:52:30.064,00:52:31.690,To whoever finds this note.
00:52:31.732,00:52:38.864,"I have been imprisoned by my father, who wishes me to marry against my will."
00:52:38.906,00:52:41.909,"Please, please come and rescue me."
00:52:41.951,00:52:45.454,I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle.
00:52:45.496,00:52:48.874,At last! A call!
00:52:48.916,00:52:52.086,This could be the sign that leads us to the Holy Grail!
00:52:52.128,00:52:56.632,"Brave, brave Concorde, you shall not have died in vain!"
00:52:56.674,00:52:58.843,"Uh, I'm not quite dead, sir."
00:53:00.928,00:53:03.555,You shall not have been mortally wounded in vain!
00:53:03.597,00:53:05.933,"I think I could pull through, sir."
00:53:07.018,00:53:08.310,"Oh, I see."
00:53:08.352,00:53:09.478,I think I'm all right to come with you.
00:53:09.520,00:53:11.229,"No, sweet Concorde! Stay here."
00:53:11.271,00:53:17.111,I will send help as soon as I have accomplished a daring and heroic rescue in my own particular...
00:53:20.698,00:53:22.533,"-Idiom, sir?"
00:53:22.574,00:53:25.661,"-No, I feel fine, actually, sir."
00:53:27.079,00:53:30.415,"I'll just stay here, shall I, sir?"
00:53:32.250,00:53:33.377,Yeah.
00:54:12.499,00:54:13.876,-Morning.
00:54:16.045,00:54:17.295,Oh.
00:54:55.459,00:54:56.919,Ha haa!
00:54:58.796,00:54:59.922,Hey!
00:55:51.098,00:55:58.856,"You're not allowed to enter the room-- Fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Lancelot of Camelot."
00:55:58.897,00:56:00.398,I have come to take-- I'm terribly sorry.
00:56:00.440,00:56:02.693,You got my note!
00:56:02.734,00:56:07.072,"-Well, I got a note."
00:56:07.114,00:56:10.159,"-Well, no, you see-- -I knew someone would."
00:56:10.201,00:56:15.539,"I knew that somewhere out there, -there must be someone..."
00:56:15.580,00:56:17.833,-Stop that! Stop that!
00:56:19.417,00:56:20.627,Who are you?
00:56:20.669,00:56:22.213,-I'm your son.
00:56:22.254,00:56:23.379,"I'm Sir Lancelot, sir."
00:56:23.421,00:56:25.381,"He's come to rescue me, Father."
00:56:25.423,00:56:28.593,-Let's not jump to conclusions.
00:56:28.635,00:56:31.596,"Uh... Oh, yes. Sorry."
00:56:31.638,00:56:34.225,-They cost 50 pounds each.
00:56:34.266,00:56:36.101,"Don't be afraid of him, Sir Lancelot."
00:56:36.143,00:56:39.021,I've got a rope all ready.
00:56:39.063,00:56:41.523,You killed eight wedding guests and all!
00:56:41.565,00:56:44.026,"Well, you see, I thought your son was a lady."
00:56:44.068,00:56:45.401,I can understand that.
00:56:45.443,00:56:47.779,"-Hurry, Sir Lancelot! Hurry!"
00:56:47.821,00:56:49.990,"You only killed the bride's father, that's all."
00:56:50.032,00:56:51.867,"Well, I really didn't mean to."
00:56:51.909,00:56:53.911,Didn't mean to? You put your sword right through his head!
00:56:53.952,00:56:56.080,"Oh, dear. Is he all right?"
00:56:56.121,00:56:58.456,You kicked the bride in the chest! It's going to cost me a fortune!
00:56:58.498,00:57:03.670,"I can explain, I was in the forest, riding north from Camelot, -when I got this note."
00:57:03.712,00:57:06.464,-Are you from Camelot?
00:57:06.506,00:57:08.592,"I'm a knight of King Arthur, sir."
00:57:08.633,00:57:12.428,"Very nice castle, Camelot."
00:57:12.470,00:57:15.515,-Is it?
00:57:15.557,00:57:16.850,Would you like to come have a drink?
00:57:16.892,00:57:19.644,That's awfully nice of you.
00:57:19.686,00:57:20.854,I am ready!
00:57:20.896,00:57:22.856,"I mean, to be so understanding."
00:57:22.898,00:57:26.818,"You see, when I'm in this idiom, I sometimes get a bit carried away."
00:57:33.700,00:57:35.452,"Now, this is the main hall."
00:57:35.493,00:57:40.540,We're gonna have all this knocked through and made into-- -There he is!
00:57:49.049,00:57:51.176,"Hold it! Hold it, please!"
00:57:51.218,00:57:53.929,"Sorry! You see what I mean, I just get carried away."
00:57:53.971,00:57:56.974,I'm really most awfully sorry.
00:57:57.015,00:57:59.893,-He's killed the best man!
00:57:59.935,00:58:02.646,"Hold it, please, hold it!"
00:58:02.687,00:58:10.279,"This is Sir Lancelot from the court of Camelot, a very brave and influential knight."
00:58:10.321,00:58:11.863,And my special guest here today.
00:58:11.905,00:58:14.699,-Hello.
00:58:14.741,00:58:17.286,"No, please! Please!"
00:58:17.328,00:58:20.331,This is supposed to be a happy occasion!
00:58:20.372,00:58:25.002,Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who.
00:58:25.043,00:58:32.259,We are here today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of a holy wedlock.
00:58:33.802,00:58:41.518,"Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, -has just fallen to his death."
00:58:41.559,00:58:45.105,"But I don't want to think I've lost a son, so much as..."
00:58:45.147,00:58:47.441,gained a daughter.
00:58:47.483,00:58:52.363,"For, since the tragic death of her father-- He's not quite dead!"
00:58:54.281,00:58:58.702,Since the near fatal wounding of her father-- He's getting better!
00:59:01.163,00:59:11.465,"For, since her own father, who, when he seemed about to recover, suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him."
00:59:11.507,00:59:14.426,"-Oh, he's died!"
00:59:14.468,00:59:23.018,"I want his only daughter to look upon me as her own dad, in a very real, and legally binding sense."
00:59:25.103,00:59:33.820,And I feel sure that the merger-- the union between the Princess and the brave but dangerous Sir Lancelot of Camelot...
00:59:33.862,00:59:37.157,-What?
00:59:39.784,00:59:43.539,-He's not quite dead!
00:59:43.580,00:59:46.166,"You fell out of the tall tower, you creep!"
00:59:46.208,00:59:49.336,"No, I was saved at the last minute."
00:59:49.378,00:59:52.506,-How?
00:59:52.548,00:59:55.884,-Not like that! Not like that.
01:00:04.684,01:00:06.395,"Quickly, sir, come this way!"
01:00:06.437,01:00:09.440,"No, it's not right for my idiom."
01:00:12.067,01:00:15.487,"-Dramatically, sir?"
01:00:27.541,01:00:30.419,"somebody give me a push, please?"
01:00:46.184,01:00:47.519,Old crone!
01:00:49.396,01:00:53.691,Is there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery?
01:00:53.733,01:00:56.528,-Who sent you?
01:00:56.570,01:01:00.240,no shrubberies here.
01:01:00.282,01:01:06.079,"If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and I will say..."
01:01:07.289,01:01:09.500,We will say Ni.
01:01:12.377,01:01:16.047,Very well. If you will not assist us voluntarily...
01:01:19.843,01:01:21.845,-Ni!
01:01:21.886,01:01:24.473,Never. No shrubberies.
01:01:24.515,01:01:26.433,-Ni!
01:01:26.475,01:01:28.893,"No, no, no."
01:01:28.935,01:01:31.647,-Noo.
01:01:31.688,01:01:33.857,-Ni.
01:01:33.898,01:01:36.693,-Ni! Ni! Ni!
01:01:36.734,01:01:40.197,Are you saying Ni to that old woman?
01:01:40.238,01:01:41.739,Um... Yes.
01:01:41.781,01:01:47.704,"Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say Ni at will to old ladies."
01:01:47.745,01:01:51.291,There is a pestilence upon this land. Nothing is sacred.
01:01:51.333,01:01:57.130,Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this period in history.
01:01:57.172,01:02:00.050,-Did you say shrubberies?
01:02:00.091,01:02:03.136,Shrubberies are my trade.
01:02:03.178,01:02:05.389,My name is Roger the Shrubber.
01:02:05.430,01:02:07.932,"I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies."
01:02:07.974,01:02:11.353,-Ni!
01:02:11.395,01:02:14.731,"Oh Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery."
01:02:14.772,01:02:17.317,-May we go now?
01:02:17.359,01:02:21.821,I like the laurels particularly.
01:02:21.863,01:02:23.823,What is that?
01:02:23.865,01:02:27.285,We are now no longer the knights who say Ni.
01:02:27.327,01:02:28.537,-Ni!
01:02:28.579,01:02:35.335,We are now the knights who say Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang -Zoo Boing Arouza!
01:02:35.377,01:02:37.212,"Therefore, we must give you a test."
01:02:37.254,01:02:41.633,"What is this test, oh Knights who until recently said Ni?"
01:02:41.675,01:02:44.720,"Firstly, you must find..."
01:02:44.761,01:02:46.971,another shrubbery!
01:02:47.013,01:02:49.307,-Not another shrubbery!
01:02:49.349,01:02:53.978,"Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here beside this shrubbery."
01:02:54.020,01:02:57.733,"Only slightly higher, so you get the two-level effect with a little path running down the middle."
01:02:57.774,01:02:59.776,A path! A path!
01:02:59.817,01:03:09.536,"Then, when you have found the shrubberies, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest with..."
01:03:09.578,01:03:12.247,-a herring!
01:03:12.289,01:03:14.874,-We shall do no such thing.
01:03:14.916,01:03:17.419,Cut down a tree with a herring?
01:03:20.130,01:03:21.632,-Don't say that word.
01:03:21.673,01:03:23.759,I cannot tell.
01:03:21.673,01:03:26.803,"Suffice to say, it's one of the words the Knights of Ni cannot hear."
01:03:26.844,01:03:29.681,How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?
01:03:29.723,01:03:32.100,-He did it again.
01:03:32.142,01:03:36.438,"No, not is!"
01:03:36.480,01:03:38.398,"My liege, it's Robin."
01:03:47.282,01:03:48.825,-Robin.
01:03:48.866,01:03:50.786,-It's good to see you.
01:03:50.827,01:03:52.829,"Surely, you haven't given up your quest for the Holy Grail?"
01:03:52.870,01:03:55.832,-Shut up!
01:03:55.873,01:03:58.460,"-No, far from it."
01:03:58.502,01:04:00.837,-I was looking for it...
01:04:00.878,01:04:03.173,"...uh, here in this forest."
01:04:03.214,01:04:07.719,"-No, it is far from this place."
01:04:07.761,01:04:10.305,-The word we cannot hear!
01:04:10.347,01:04:12.349,-He said it again!
01:04:12.390,01:04:15.644,I've said it. I've said it.
01:04:15.686,01:04:17.145,"And there again, that's three its!"
01:04:23.901,01:04:33.870,and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to find the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in Scene 24.
01:04:33.911,01:04:38.416,"Beyond the forest they met Lancelot and Galahad, and there was much rejoicing."
01:04:50.887,01:04:55.475,"In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat Robin's minstrels."
01:04:56.643,01:04:58.228,And there was much rejoicing.
01:05:00.564,01:05:01.857,A year passed.
01:05:05.943,01:05:08.946,-Winter changed into spring.
01:05:08.988,01:05:11.658,Spring changed into summer.
01:05:11.700,01:05:17.831,"Summer changed back into winter, and winter gave spring and summer a miss and went straight on into autumn."
01:05:17.873,01:05:18.915,Ah.
01:05:19.999,01:05:21.251,Until one day.
01:05:43.690,01:05:44.982,Knights...
01:05:46.067,01:05:47.026,forward!
01:06:24.731,01:06:30.111,What manner of man are you that can summon up fire -without flint or tinder?
01:06:30.153,01:06:31.655,am an enchanter.
01:06:34.449,01:06:38.328,-By what name are you known?
01:06:40.413,01:06:43.166,-Tim.
01:06:43.207,01:06:45.335,"Greetings, King Arthur."
01:06:46.461,01:06:48.338,-You know my name?
01:06:56.095,01:06:58.849,You seek the Holy Grail.
01:06:58.890,01:07:02.310,"That is our quest. You know much that is hidden, oh Tim."
01:07:02.352,01:07:03.728,Quite.
01:07:12.069,01:07:14.739,"Yes, we are looking for the Holy Grail."
01:07:14.781,01:07:16.783,Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.
01:07:16.825,01:07:18.994,"Yes, it is."
01:07:21.913,01:07:25.667,-And so we're looking for it.
01:07:25.709,01:07:27.669,-We have been for some time.
01:07:30.714,01:07:35.134,"So, anything you could do to help would be..."
01:07:37.679,01:07:41.098,very... helpful.
01:07:41.140,01:07:42.642,"Look, can you tell us where--?"
01:07:46.646,01:07:56.447,"Fine, I don't want to waste any more of your time, but I don't suppose you could tell us where we might find a..."
01:07:56.489,01:07:58.491,A what?
01:07:58.533,01:08:00.911,A g... A g...
01:08:00.952,01:08:02.078,A Grail?
01:08:02.119,01:08:03.788,"Yes, I think so."
01:08:07.625,01:08:09.044,Yes!
01:08:10.420,01:08:12.380,-Oh. Thank you.
01:08:16.927,01:08:24.434,"Look, you're a busy man-- Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail."
01:08:24.475,01:08:26.102,"Oh, thank you."
01:08:26.143,01:08:29.814,"To the north, there lies a cave."
01:08:29.856,01:08:38.364,"Wherein, carved in mystic runes, upon the very living rock, the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged..."
01:08:40.533,01:08:45.329,...make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
01:08:45.371,01:08:47.749,"Where could we find this cave, oh Tim?"
01:08:47.791,01:08:49.042,Follow!
01:08:50.543,01:08:54.672,But follow only if ye be men of valor.
01:08:54.714,01:09:06.726,"For the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel, that no man yet has fought with it and lived."
01:09:06.768,01:09:12.649,Bones of full 50 men lie strewn about its lair.
01:09:12.690,01:09:26.079,"So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth."
01:09:28.247,01:09:30.083,What an eccentric performance.
01:09:43.638,01:09:45.306,"They're nervous, sire."
01:09:45.348,01:09:47.809,"Then we'd best leave them here and carry on, on foot."
01:09:47.851,01:09:49.268,Dismount!
01:10:02.406,01:10:06.410,Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!
01:10:08.830,01:10:12.667,"-Right, keep me covered."
01:10:12.709,01:10:14.544,-Just keep me covered.
01:10:16.671,01:10:17.672,There he is!
01:10:20.800,01:10:22.259,-Where?
01:10:23.887,01:10:25.221,"What, behind the rabbit?"
01:10:25.262,01:10:27.598,It is the rabbit.
01:10:29.142,01:10:31.561,-You silly sod!
01:10:31.602,01:10:33.188,You got us all worked up.
01:10:33.229,01:10:35.272,That's no ordinary rabbit.
01:10:35.314,01:10:40.361,"That's the most foul, cruel and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on."
01:10:40.403,01:10:43.781,You tit! I soiled my armor I was so scared!
01:10:43.823,01:10:47.368,"Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide."
01:10:47.410,01:10:49.453,-It's a killer!
01:10:49.495,01:10:51.873,"-He'll do you up a treat, mate!"
01:10:51.915,01:10:54.458,-You manky Scots git!
01:10:54.500,01:10:58.213,-What's he do? Nibble your bum?
01:10:59.296,01:11:01.424,It can leap about...
01:11:01.465,01:11:03.259,Look at the bones!
01:11:03.300,01:11:05.220,"Go on, Bors, chop its head off."
01:11:05.261,01:11:08.973,Right. Silly little bleeder.
01:11:11.101,01:11:13.144,-Look!
01:11:15.396,01:11:18.649,-Jesus Christ!
01:11:18.691,01:11:20.777,-I've done it again.
01:11:20.818,01:11:24.280,But did you listen to me?
01:11:24.321,01:11:26.991,"Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?"
01:11:27.033,01:11:29.869,"Well, it's always the same."
01:11:27.033,01:11:33.123,"I always-- -Oh, shut up!"
01:11:33.164,01:11:35.917,-Charge!
01:11:51.515,01:11:55.352,Run away! Run away!
01:12:03.402,01:12:05.529,-Right. How many did we lose?
01:12:05.571,01:12:07.657,-Ector.
01:12:07.698,01:12:09.993,"-Three, sir."
01:12:10.034,01:12:13.746,"We better not risk another frontal assault, that rabbit's dynamite."
01:12:13.788,01:12:16.415,Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?
01:12:16.457,01:12:19.919,-Shut up and change your armor.
01:12:19.961,01:12:22.880,It may become so cross that it will make a mistake.
01:12:22.922,01:12:24.048,Like what?
01:12:25.341,01:12:26.425,Well...
01:12:29.470,01:12:31.430,-Have we got bows?
01:12:31.472,01:12:33.933,-We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
01:12:33.975,01:12:35.768,The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.
01:12:35.810,01:12:38.688,It's one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him.
01:12:38.729,01:12:41.816,Brother Maynard!
01:13:13.348,01:13:16.934,How does it...
01:13:16.976,01:13:19.436,"-I know not, my liege."
01:13:19.478,01:13:23.316,Armaments chapter 2: verses 9-21.
01:13:26.569,01:13:52.469,"And St. Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, 'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that with it thou mayest blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.' And the Lord did grin and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and-- Skip a bit, Brother."
01:13:54.347,01:14:05.441,"And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin, then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less."
01:14:05.482,01:14:10.654,"Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shalt be three."
01:14:10.696,01:14:18.704,"Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three."
01:14:19.747,01:14:23.167,Five is right out.
01:14:23.209,01:14:39.725,"Once the number three, being the third number be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.' -Amen."
01:14:39.767,01:14:41.477,Right.
01:14:41.518,01:14:43.771,"One, two, five!"
01:14:43.813,01:14:45.689,"-Three, sir!"
01:15:31.944,01:15:34.071,There! Look!
01:15:34.113,01:15:36.491,-What does it say?
01:15:36.532,01:15:38.951,"Brother Maynard, you're our scholar."
01:15:38.993,01:15:40.870,It is Aramaic!
01:15:40.911,01:15:43.998,Of course. Joseph of Arimathea!
01:15:44.040,01:15:46.250,-Of course.
01:15:46.292,01:15:53.966,"It reads, Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Arimathea."
01:15:54.008,01:16:08.689,He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the Castle of Aaargh.' What?
01:16:08.731,01:16:13.277,The Castle of Aaargh.
01:16:13.319,01:16:14.987,What is that?
01:16:15.029,01:16:17.323,He must have died while carving it.
01:16:17.365,01:16:20.243,"-Oh, come on!"
01:16:20.284,01:16:24.080,"Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve Aaargh."
01:16:24.121,01:16:25.540,He'd just say it.
01:16:25.581,01:16:27.583,That's what's carved in the rock.
01:16:27.624,01:16:29.919,-Perhaps he was dictating it.
01:16:29.960,01:16:32.380,-Does it say anything else?
01:16:32.422,01:16:35.632,Just Aaargh.
01:16:37.634,01:16:40.012,-Aaargh.
01:16:40.054,01:16:43.849,Do you suppose he meant the Camargue?
01:16:43.891,01:16:45.935,-Where's that?
01:16:45.976,01:16:49.146,Isn't there a St. Aaargh's in Cornwall?
01:16:49.188,01:16:50.647,"No, that's St. Ives."
01:16:50.689,01:16:53.484,"-Oh, yes. St. Ives."
01:16:53.526,01:16:55.361,Ooooh!
01:16:55.403,01:16:57.613,"No, Aaargh."
01:16:57.654,01:17:01.367,"No no no, Ooh, in surprise and alarm!"
01:17:01.409,01:17:04.078,-You mean a sort of an Ah!
01:17:04.120,01:17:05.871,-Aaah!
01:17:05.913,01:17:06.997,My God!
01:17:09.666,01:17:12.503,It's the legendary Black Beast of...
01:17:12.545,01:17:14.338,Aaah!
01:17:14.380,01:17:16.673,That's it! That's it!
01:17:16.715,01:17:18.384,Run away! Run away!
01:17:27.684,01:17:28.894,Keep running.
01:17:32.064,01:17:34.900,-Shh. Shh.
01:17:36.819,01:17:43.200,"Black Beast lunged forward, escape for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless."
01:17:43.242,01:17:47.455,"When, suddenly, the animator suffered a fatal heart attack."
01:17:47.497,01:17:50.749,The cartoon peril was no more.
01:17:50.791,01:17:54.086,The quest for the Holy Grail could continue.
01:18:05.889,01:18:07.683,There it is!
01:18:07.724,01:18:11.979,-The Bridge of Death.
01:18:12.021,01:18:15.149,Look! There's the old man from Scene 24.
01:18:15.191,01:18:17.026,What's he doing here?
01:18:17.067,01:18:19.362,He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.
01:18:19.403,01:18:21.738,He asks each traveler five questions.
01:18:21.780,01:18:23.824,-Three questions.
01:18:23.866,01:18:27.828,He who answers the five questions-- Three questions.
01:18:27.870,01:18:30.289,"...three questions, may cross in safety."
01:18:30.331,01:18:31.999,What if you get a question wrong?
01:18:32.041,01:18:35.711,Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.
01:18:35.752,01:18:37.254,"Oh, wacko."
01:18:37.296,01:18:39.048,Who's going to answer the questions?
01:18:39.089,01:18:40.716,-Sir Robin?
01:18:40.757,01:18:42.677,"Brave Sir Robin, you go."
01:18:42.718,01:18:45.346,Hey!
01:18:45.388,01:18:47.097,Why doesn't Lancelot go?
01:18:47.139,01:18:49.725,"Yes, let me go, my liege."
01:18:49.766,01:18:53.646,I shall make a feint to the northeast-- No. Hang on! Hang on!
01:18:53.688,01:18:56.732,Just answer the five questions-- Three questions.
01:18:56.773,01:18:57.983,"...three questions, as best you can."
01:18:58.025,01:19:00.653,And we shall watch and pray.
01:19:00.695,01:19:02.655,"I understand, my liege."
01:19:02.697,01:19:06.283,"Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot."
01:19:10.663,01:19:12.164,Stop!
01:19:13.457,01:19:17.836,"Who would cross the Bridge of Death, must answer me these questions three."
01:19:17.878,01:19:20.590,Ere the other side he see.
01:19:20.631,01:19:23.426,"Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I'm not afraid."
01:19:23.467,01:19:25.761,What is your name?
01:19:25.802,01:19:28.097,My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.
01:19:28.138,01:19:30.641,What is your quest?
01:19:30.683,01:19:32.560,To seek the Holy Grail.
01:19:32.602,01:19:35.563,What is your favorite color?
01:19:35.605,01:19:38.065,-Blue.
01:19:39.400,01:19:41.360,"Well, thank you."
01:19:45.822,01:19:46.990,That's easy.
01:19:49.326,01:19:50.578,Stop!
01:19:51.828,01:19:56.667,"Who approacheth the Bridge of Death, must answer me these questions three."
01:19:56.709,01:19:59.795,Ere the other side he see.
01:19:59.836,01:20:02.757,"Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I'm not afraid."

01:20:15.311,01:20:16.771,I don't know that!
01:20:24.945,01:20:26.989,Stop!

01:20:51.096,01:20:53.182,"It is Arthur, King of the Britons."
01:20:53.223,01:20:57.478,-What is your quest?
01:20:57.520,01:21:01.691,What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?

01:21:06.153,01:21:08.030,I don't know that.
01:21:13.910,01:21:16.330,How do you know so much about swallows?
01:21:16.372,01:21:19.333,"You have to know these things when you're a king, you know."
01:21:59.122,01:22:00.082,Lancelot!
01:22:02.084,01:22:03.502,Lancelot!

01:22:21.771,01:22:22.813,Lancelot!
01:24:07.292,01:24:11.839,The Castle Aargh.
01:24:30.357,01:24:31.942,God be praised.
01:24:35.529,01:24:44.663,"Almighty God, we thank thee, that thou hast vouchsafed to us the most holy-- Jesus Christ!"
01:24:46.122,01:24:51.587,"Hello, stuffy English knights and Monsieur Arthur King, who has the brain of a duck, you know."
01:24:51.628,01:24:54.715,"So, we French fellows outwit you a second time."
01:24:54.757,01:24:58.260,How dare you profane this place with your presence?
01:24:58.301,01:25:09.312,"I command you, in the name of the Knights of Camelot, to open the doors of this sacred castle, to which God himself has guided us."
01:25:09.354,01:25:10.940,How you English say?
01:25:10.981,01:25:16.111,"One more time, I unclog my nose in your direction, sons of a window-dresser!"
01:25:16.152,01:25:22.325,"So, you think you could out-clever us French folk with your silly knees-bent, running about, advancing behavior."
01:25:22.367,01:25:25.412,I wave my private parts at your aunties.
01:25:25.454,01:25:30.250,"You cheesy lot of second-hand, electric donkey-bottom biters!"
01:25:30.292,01:25:35.839,"In the name of the Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred castle!"
01:25:35.881,01:25:38.550,"No chance, English bed-wetting types."
01:25:38.592,01:25:43.722,"I burst my pimples at you, and call your door-opening request a silly thing!"
01:25:43.764,01:25:47.059,You tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms.
01:25:47.101,01:25:50.771,"If you'll not open this door, we shall take this castle by force!"
01:25:52.606,01:25:59.404,In the name of God and the glory of our-- -Right! That settles it!
01:25:59.446,01:26:08.122,"Yes, depart at this time, and don't be approaching any more, or we fire arrows in the tops of your heads, and make castanets out of your testicles already."
01:26:08.163,01:26:09.706,"Walk away, just ignore them."
01:26:09.748,01:26:13.961,"And now remain gone, illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!"
01:26:14.003,01:26:22.427,"And, if you think you got a nasty taunting this time, you ain't heard nothing yet, stuffy English k-nights!"
01:26:43.949,01:26:47.202,-We shall attack at once.
01:26:47.243,01:26:49.371,Stand by for attack!
01:27:48.847,01:27:50.348,French persons!
01:27:52.184,01:27:55.353,Today the blood of many a valiant knight shall be avenged.
01:27:55.395,01:28:07.616,"In the name of God, we shall not stop our fight till each one of you lies dead, and the Holy Grail returns to those whom God has chosen!"
01:28:08.909,01:28:10.827,Charge!
01:28:37.479,01:28:39.689,"Yes, they're the ones, I'm sure."
01:28:41.775,01:28:45.528,"Right, come on. Get back."
01:28:52.077,01:28:55.247,-Put him in the van.
01:28:55.289,01:28:57.749,"Come on, back! Right back!"
01:29:00.043,01:29:02.337,"That's an offensive weapon, that is."
01:29:05.507,01:29:08.093,"All right, sonny, that's enough."
