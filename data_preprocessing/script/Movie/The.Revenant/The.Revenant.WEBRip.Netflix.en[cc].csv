00:01:09.569,00:01:14.491,I know you want this to be over.
00:01:20.997,00:01:23.083,I'm right here.
00:01:27.504,00:01:30.131,I will be right here...
00:01:37.639,00:01:40.058,"But, you don't give up."
00:01:43.061,00:01:46.022,You hear me?
00:01:47.857,00:01:52.904,"As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight."
00:01:54.531,00:01:57.909,You breathe... keep breathing.
00:04:32.063,00:04:34.065,"Ah, shit."
00:04:35.900,00:04:38.569,Goddamn sumbitches.
00:04:40.738,00:04:43.366,The sumbitch got shit for brains.
00:04:48.913,00:04:51.082,-You seen Coulter? TRAPPER: Nope.
00:04:54.043,00:04:55.378,Listen up!
00:04:55.586,00:04:59.257,"When them plews is cleaned, I want you to hoop 'em up real tight."
00:04:59.590,00:05:03.261,"Remember, we're not doing no 15-pelt bales!"
00:05:03.469,00:05:05.555,-We're doing 30-pelt bales! HENRY: Fitzgerald!
00:05:06.597,00:05:07.598,Cap'n.
00:05:07.765,00:05:10.893,Where are we with the haul? What are you thinking?
00:05:11.936,00:05:14.647,"I'm thinking, whatever it is they're hunting out there..."
00:05:14.814,00:05:16.774,...I hope it don't need another shot.
00:05:16.941,00:05:18.901,Make sure we're ready to head out by dawn.
00:05:19.068,00:05:20.361,Been done by this morning.
00:05:20.528,00:05:23.573,"I'd have liked to be out by now, but the men are too tired."
00:05:23.740,00:05:26.284,We're only a few days from the fort. We're trapped out.
00:05:26.451,00:05:29.620,All we have to worry about is fresh meat for the boys.
00:05:30.246,00:05:32.665,"Well, you, uh, seen Coulter?"
00:05:35.626,00:05:38.671,"JIM: Hey, we took down an elk. A big one."
00:05:39.672,00:05:41.424,We need help to haul the meat back.
00:05:41.591,00:05:44.260,Let me know when it's on the spit. I'll help you with it then.
00:05:44.510,00:05:46.095,"Come on, I need your help."
00:05:46.345,00:05:48.681,We needed help when we were loading them bales.
00:05:49.015,00:05:51.684,I been eating this damn beaver meat so long...
00:05:52.018,00:05:54.062,...I'm starting to miss my wife's cooking.
00:05:54.228,00:05:56.856,-I'm starting to miss your wife. -Shut up.
00:05:57.190,00:05:58.357,COULTER: Help!
00:05:59.192,00:06:00.526,Help.
00:06:01.027,00:06:02.361,TRAPPER 1: Is that Coulter?
00:06:02.695,00:06:04.655,You go get the Captain.
00:06:04.822,00:06:06.282,STUBBY BILL: Jesus Christ.
00:06:09.452,00:06:11.204,TRAPPER 2: Anybody see them?
00:06:11.537,00:06:14.165,TRAPPER 3: Stay quiet. TRAPPER 4: Watch the ridge.
00:06:32.934,00:06:33.976,Pa?
00:06:34.352,00:06:35.603,Let's go.
00:06:49.659,00:06:50.952,TRAPPER 4: Shh.
00:07:21.941,00:07:24.610,I can't see 'em. I can't see 'em.
00:07:29.615,00:07:31.117,HENRY: Get down!
00:07:32.618,00:07:35.121,We're surrounded! They're everywhere!
00:07:35.371,00:07:36.998,HENRY: Stay here! Stay here!
00:07:38.332,00:07:39.625,"Paul, no!"
00:07:43.421,00:07:44.839,TRAPPER 3: Stay down!
00:07:48.384,00:07:51.053,-They want us out in the open. TRAPPER 3: Someone get him help!
00:07:51.304,00:07:53.806,Nobody move! Stay where you are!
00:07:54.140,00:07:55.766,They want the pelts.
00:07:55.933,00:07:59.061,We got to get on that boat right now or we'll lose it all.
00:08:20.917,00:08:22.251,"Move, move!"
00:08:25.338,00:08:29.175,Leave the furs! Leave the furs! To the boat!
00:08:54.283,00:08:56.452,Hawk!
00:09:02.458,00:09:03.960,Hawk!
00:09:04.377,00:09:05.962,Hawk!
00:09:34.240,00:09:37.577,"Grab some pelts! Come on, grab the pelts!"
00:09:56.929,00:10:00.600,Grab the pelts! Grab the pelts!
00:10:16.699,00:10:18.451,DAVE: Give this to my little girl.
00:10:18.784,00:10:20.786,You're coming with us. I'll get help.
00:10:27.960,00:10:30.630,GLASS: Leave the furs! Leave the pelts!
00:10:31.464,00:10:32.548,Willman!
00:10:33.633,00:10:36.594,-Lean on me. Just keep going. -Ahh!
00:10:39.639,00:10:41.641,Get to the boat!
00:11:03.579,00:11:05.081,Fucking savage!
00:11:06.415,00:11:08.668,Get on the fucking boat!
00:11:18.260,00:11:19.595,Help!
00:11:31.690,00:11:34.026,HENRY: Cut the rope! Cut the rope!
00:11:34.360,00:11:35.861,Wait for Amos!
00:11:36.028,00:11:37.530,No! We go now!
00:11:37.863,00:11:39.698,Fire the cannon!
00:11:50.042,00:11:52.545,AMOS: Don't leave! Wait!
00:12:41.594,00:12:43.387,Collect all the pelts we can carry.
00:12:44.180,00:12:51.145,We'll trade pelts with the French for horses and keep searching for her.
00:12:54.106,00:12:55.941,HENRY: --and dust becomes flour...
00:12:56.525,00:12:58.194,...and when the morning is clear...
00:12:58.360,00:13:02.615,...this child of God will meet Jesus Christ himself. Amen.
00:13:02.781,00:13:04.742,MAN 1: Amen. MAN 2: Amen.
00:13:17.630,00:13:18.797,HENRY: You ready?
00:13:20.799,00:13:22.134,Hold still.
00:13:27.473,00:13:28.974,ANDERSON: Where did you learn that?
00:13:29.725,00:13:32.144,My father was a doctor. Bridger!
00:13:32.478,00:13:34.605,"FITZGERALD: Captain, we got a swarm of tree niggers..."
00:13:34.772,00:13:36.649,...out here waiting to finish the job.
00:13:39.985,00:13:42.404,Tell me you got some kind of plan.
00:13:47.493,00:13:48.661,Glass?
00:13:49.828,00:13:51.830,Missouri's no good.
00:13:52.331,00:13:54.583,Not while the Ree's running it.
00:13:55.000,00:13:56.585,We got to get off this boat.
00:13:56.835,00:13:58.837,"Oh, you want to get off the boat?"
00:14:00.256,00:14:02.174,"Then what do we do, huh?"
00:14:02.508,00:14:06.512,Take our furs and sit out there amongst the Ree like a bunch of ducks?
00:14:06.845,00:14:10.015,Only safe thing to do is track a new course back up on land.
00:14:10.182,00:14:11.559,That'll add weeks to the trip.
00:14:11.725,00:14:13.769,Better than floating where they can get eyes on us.
00:14:14.019,00:14:16.355,"They got eyes on you right now, son."
00:14:17.690,00:14:20.526,What I'm saying is we stay on the boat.
00:14:20.860,00:14:24.530,Chart a course toward the fort and take our chances on the water.
00:14:24.864,00:14:29.076,Glass knows this territory best. It's his job to get us home safe.
00:14:29.243,00:14:30.411,-Get us home safe? -Yeah.
00:14:30.578,00:14:32.872,FITZGERALD: Need I remind you we already lost 32 men?
00:14:33.038,00:14:37.126,"It's 33 now. They were my men, Fitzgerald. I know how many I lost."
00:14:38.043,00:14:40.629,We do like Glass says. That's the end of it.
00:14:54.310,00:14:55.686,GLASS: We have to set the boat loose.
00:14:55.853,00:14:58.272,"If the Ree are tracking us, they'll find it downriver."
00:14:58.606,00:15:02.109,Best course is to hike inland to the Grand and follow it to Fort Kiowa.
00:15:02.276,00:15:05.279,On foot? It'll be winter before we get there.
00:15:05.487,00:15:08.282,"Yeah, unless we come across a post, trade for some horses."
00:15:08.449,00:15:10.284,Ain't no posts that far over!
00:15:10.618,00:15:13.662,"Captain, losing this boat is a goddamn mistake."
00:15:13.996,00:15:16.123,The Ree ain't that stupid.
00:15:16.290,00:15:18.500,"We keep it, we can lay it up around Arrow's Peak."
00:15:18.667,00:15:20.794,Quit acting like you know what you're talking about.
00:15:20.961,00:15:22.463,Ain't nobody talking to you.
00:15:22.671,00:15:24.131,Who'd listen to you anyway?
00:15:24.298,00:15:27.343,Can't find your way out of your breeches to take a shit.
00:15:27.635,00:15:30.971,All I'm saying is Camp Rhulen is just up the way.
00:15:31.305,00:15:33.015,We can hole up there.
00:15:33.474,00:15:34.975,We walk.
00:15:35.643,00:15:37.645,"Yeah, I'm sure we will."
00:15:38.646,00:15:42.816,Wish my dad was a doctor. Then he could've bought me a captain's job.
00:15:43.025,00:15:44.401,"What do we do, eh?"
00:15:44.568,00:15:47.655,Pray these pelts ain't rotten if we ever get back here?
00:15:47.988,00:15:51.992,HENRY: Make sure to mark this place. We're leaving a fortune under these rocks.
00:15:53.118,00:15:55.579,"Glass, chart a course."
00:15:55.746,00:15:57.790,Tightest you can that gets us around the Ree.
00:15:57.957,00:15:59.375,"Yes, sir."
00:15:59.833,00:16:01.502,FITZGERALD: This ain't right.
00:16:02.586,00:16:07.424,We all know these furs ain't gonna be here by the time we come back.
00:16:07.675,00:16:11.011,There's no way we can haul them all the way to the fort.
00:16:11.345,00:16:14.515,Arikara are all through the territory. We'll want our hands free.
00:16:14.682,00:16:16.517,We're gonna lose those pelts.
00:16:16.684,00:16:19.520,-You rather keep the pelts or your life? -Life?
00:16:19.770,00:16:22.523,What life you talking about? I ain't got no life.
00:16:22.773,00:16:26.443,I just got living and the only way I get that is through these pelts.
00:16:27.861,00:16:29.113,Fuck!
00:16:31.532,00:16:36.495,Ain't no way I'm going home after six months working my ass off like a mule...
00:16:36.787,00:16:39.873,"...risking my neck, men dying, and for what?"
00:16:40.207,00:16:44.044,Damn near lost everything. Job's been fucked from the start!
00:16:45.045,00:16:47.047,There's the one been fucking us.
00:16:47.548,00:16:50.718,You wonder how the Ree got the dead drop on us...
00:16:50.926,00:16:54.263,...when Mr. Glass was supposed to look out for that very thing?
00:16:54.555,00:16:56.181,All them Pawnee buddies of his.
00:16:56.348,00:16:59.101,Pawnee's as much against the Ree as the rest of us.
00:16:59.435,00:17:00.519,Yeah?
00:17:01.020,00:17:04.690,"Well, what about his little half-breed son?"
00:17:05.190,00:17:07.359,What kind of savage you think his mama was?
00:17:07.609,00:17:09.445,"Oh, lay off the boy, Fitz."
00:17:10.112,00:17:11.864,All I'm saying is...
00:17:12.197,00:17:14.867,...a savage is savage.
00:17:22.624,00:17:24.293,"Hey, Glass..."
00:17:25.544,00:17:26.754,...is it true what they say...
00:17:26.920,00:17:30.049,...about you shooting a lieutenant while living with them savages?
00:17:30.215,00:17:31.550,HENRY: Fitzgerald.
00:17:34.219,00:17:36.889,FITZGERALD: Twenty-one dead soldiers and 40 dead feathernecks.
00:17:37.222,00:17:39.391,But you and your boy the only ones to walk out alive.
00:17:39.558,00:17:41.518,Kind of a miracle.
00:17:41.685,00:17:43.103,"HENRY: Shut up, Fitzgerald."
00:17:44.980,00:17:46.190,FITZGERALD: Is that what you did?
00:17:46.356,00:17:48.734,Shot one of your own to save this little dog here?
00:17:48.984,00:17:50.235,Shut up!
00:17:50.569,00:17:53.072,"Why? Was he playing with this little boy's mama, huh?"
00:17:53.238,00:17:55.574,HENRY: Fitzgerald! -Did he kill her?
00:17:56.241,00:17:59.244,"Hey, you can quit polishing that rifle when I'm talking to you."
00:17:59.578,00:18:00.913,I'm working on it.
00:18:01.080,00:18:03.582,You can work on it when I'm done talking to you.
00:18:03.916,00:18:05.292,Look at me.
00:18:05.459,00:18:06.752,HENRY: That's enough!
00:18:07.586,00:18:09.838,"You're forgetting your place, boy."
00:18:11.173,00:18:15.469,"As far as I can tell, my place is here on the smart end of this rifle."
00:18:15.636,00:18:17.805,"HENRY: You move along, Fitzgerald."
00:18:19.306,00:18:20.682,That's an order!
00:18:20.974,00:18:23.602,Listen! There's only a couple hours of light left.
00:18:23.936,00:18:26.063,We got to stash these pelts and get rid of the boat.
00:18:26.230,00:18:27.439,"-Let's go! MAN: Yes, captain."
00:18:32.027,00:18:33.195,At least he...
00:18:33.362,00:18:37.199,"--If you want to survive, keep your mouth shut."
00:18:37.366,00:18:41.495,- At least he hear me... - They don't hear your voice!
00:18:41.662,00:18:43.956,They just see the color of your face.
00:18:44.123,00:18:46.542,You understand?
00:18:46.708,00:18:47.793,Yes.
00:18:52.589,00:18:55.008,"You have to listen to me, son."
00:18:55.175,00:18:57.344,You have to listen.
00:19:09.565,00:19:11.066,HENRY: Beckett!
00:19:12.317,00:19:13.527,Weston!
00:19:13.861,00:19:15.654,JONES: Why are they not jumping?
00:19:15.988,00:19:18.323,STUBBY BILL: It looks like they changed their minds.
00:19:24.329,00:19:26.331,FITZGERALD: Smart sumbitches.
00:19:26.999,00:19:28.333,Smart.
00:19:34.673,00:19:37.009,I ought to be on that boat.
00:19:40.512,00:19:42.514,They did the right thing.
00:19:59.239,00:20:00.699,GLASS: It's time to move.
00:20:01.450,00:20:02.868,Get up.
00:20:03.994,00:20:05.120,We're headed out.
00:20:07.998,00:20:09.499,I'm coming.
00:20:12.377,00:20:14.379,It's better you lay down.
00:20:16.340,00:20:20.469,When the rest of the men are ready you send them to me.
00:20:20.636,00:20:22.387,I'm going west.
00:20:36.902,00:20:42.741,You are my son.
00:20:59.591,00:21:02.010,WARRIOR 1: The others probably took her.
00:21:02.177,00:21:03.845,They went north.
00:21:05.472,00:21:08.100,ELK DOG: We'll pick up their tracks on the mountain.
00:21:17.567,00:21:19.111,HENRY: Was it the right decision?
00:21:19.278,00:21:20.570,Leaving the boat?
00:21:25.742,00:21:28.078,We stay east of the Grand through the mountains...
00:21:28.245,00:21:29.705,...we cut a week off our trip.
00:21:29.913,00:21:33.041,Lands are bone dry up there. Nothing for the Ree to hunt.
00:21:34.042,00:21:35.419,HENRY: Except us.
00:21:35.752,00:21:37.379,GLASS: Except us.
00:21:44.094,00:21:46.096,Is it true what Fitzgerald said?
00:21:47.597,00:21:50.267,Is that why you came out here to the edge of the world?
00:21:53.103,00:21:54.104,Glass?
00:21:54.396,00:21:56.231,I do like the quiet.
00:21:58.275,00:21:59.609,Your boy...
00:21:59.943,00:22:01.611,...he's seen a lot.
00:22:02.279,00:22:05.115,He got a mother you need to get him back to?
00:29:05.034,00:29:06.828,JIM: Mr. Glass!
00:29:07.495,00:29:08.997,There are cubs here!
00:29:12.667,00:29:14.169,We got cubs here!
00:29:18.214,00:29:19.883,Christ Almighty.
00:29:24.220,00:29:25.722,He's down here!
00:29:27.849,00:29:29.559,ANDERSON: Keep your eyes open. There's bears around.
00:29:29.726,00:29:31.686,JIM: I need your help now!
00:29:34.856,00:29:36.232,"HENRY: Oh, my God."
00:29:39.194,00:29:41.070,Get me rags now!
00:29:41.404,00:29:44.073,Give me rags before he bleeds out. Rags.
00:29:44.908,00:29:47.911,Prepare the kit. Bridger! You hold that.
00:29:49.871,00:29:51.247,"Easy. Oh, my God."
00:29:51.414,00:29:54.042,ANDERSON: Got to give him credit for taking that grizz down with him.
00:29:54.250,00:29:57.420,He shouldn't have shot. The place is crawling with tree niggers.
00:29:57.712,00:30:01.758,HENRY: That's enough! That's enough! We're still in Ree territory.
00:30:02.091,00:30:03.718,He's one of our own men.
00:30:05.637,00:30:09.432,Scout a circle around us. North and west. Take those two with you.
00:30:09.766,00:30:11.559,"Bill, Fryman, you take south and east."
00:30:11.726,00:30:14.229,Watch for anyone that might've heard that shot.
00:30:14.604,00:30:16.356,We have to stitch him up.
00:30:19.567,00:30:20.944,You just stay here.
00:30:21.152,00:30:22.153,Hold it down.
00:30:22.529,00:30:26.366,"JIM: I'm so sorry, Mr. Glass. HENRY: Bridger, press down here."
00:30:27.575,00:30:29.160,"JIM: He's bleeding down here, too."
00:30:30.662,00:30:32.247,ANDERSON: They're torturing the bastard.
00:30:32.956,00:30:37.085,The proper thing to do would be to finish him off quick.
00:30:37.460,00:30:40.088,Unless he has a chance of pulling through.
00:30:41.965,00:30:43.633,Pulling through?
00:30:43.967,00:30:45.969,You saw what that grizz did to him.
00:30:46.135,00:30:48.137,-He'll be dead inside an hour. -Mm-hm.
00:30:49.472,00:30:53.101,"Yeah, we all will be if he don't quit wailing like that."
00:30:55.770,00:30:58.940,Toward you and twist it into place. I'll hold him. Go.
00:30:59.148,00:31:00.942,-Pa. HENRY: Hold him. Go.
00:31:02.151,00:31:03.236,Go!
00:31:03.611,00:31:04.612,Now!
00:31:09.868,00:31:11.536,He passed out.
00:31:12.370,00:31:15.039,I'll take advantage and stitch up his neck.
00:31:16.207,00:31:17.292,Water.
00:31:24.716,00:31:26.759,"Bridger, tell the others we'll camp here tonight."
00:31:30.680,00:31:33.850,I'll be right here...
00:31:53.786,00:31:56.748,I'm glad you made it here.
00:32:00.752,00:32:02.795,We bring you many pelts.
00:32:03.087,00:32:07.425,No horses... just what we agreed.
00:32:08.301,00:32:10.511,Take all the pelts you want.
00:32:10.929,00:32:13.765,We need horses and rifles.
00:32:14.223,00:32:17.101,I need a woman with big tits...
00:32:17.268,00:32:18.895,Who can cook.
00:32:22.774,00:32:23.900,TOUSSAINT: What's he saying?
00:32:25.985,00:32:27.946,Bring us something to drink... some whiskey.
00:32:29.447,00:32:31.699,Tell him to stop asking about the horses.
00:32:33.993,00:32:35.495,Always good doing business with you.
00:32:35.995,00:32:37.372,Horses.
00:32:37.914,00:32:38.998,No horses.
00:32:40.208,00:32:41.876,All we can trade are guns and ammunition.
00:32:42.710,00:32:46.422,"Tell him if he asks about horses again, there is no deal."
00:32:47.006,00:32:50.259,Where did you get these? The Americans?
00:32:50.885,00:32:52.387,They're already branded.
00:32:52.929,00:32:56.724,I'll only be able to get half price for them.
00:32:57.725,00:32:59.727,Get him away from there.
00:32:59.894,00:33:01.312,I said no horses.
00:33:04.440,00:33:05.942,I'm not going to say it again.
00:33:06.109,00:33:07.652,They aren't part of the deal.
00:33:07.819,00:33:09.320,Now tell your man to step away.
00:33:09.487,00:33:12.281,"We had an agreement, you have to honor it."
00:33:18.496,00:33:21.374,INTERPRETER: I told you he speaks French.
00:33:22.917,00:33:25.003,Those pelts are stolen.
00:33:35.013,00:33:36.639,Everything!
00:33:36.931,00:33:38.349,The land.
00:33:38.808,00:33:40.768,The animals.
00:33:41.686,00:33:49.694,"Two white men snuck into our village, and took my daughter, Powaqa."
00:33:50.862,00:33:55.742,We leave you these pelts because honor demands it.
00:33:55.908,00:33:58.953,I take your horses to find my daughter.
00:33:59.120,00:34:02.749,You are free to try and stop me.
00:34:06.586,00:34:10.006,Business is business.
00:34:12.508,00:34:15.887,Prepare five horses for them.
00:34:21.934,00:34:24.771,HENRY: I want everybody up at the crack of dawn.
00:34:25.438,00:34:30.651,"Carrying Glass will be hard, so we need to get ahead as far as possible."
00:34:31.611,00:34:33.446,We'll divide into two groups.
00:34:33.905,00:34:38.826,"Fitzgerald, Jones, Fryman, you take the east side of the river."
00:34:39.327,00:34:41.496,"Anderson, you scout up front."
00:34:41.829,00:34:44.165,That claw don't belong to you.
00:34:46.584,00:34:48.086,It ain't for me.
00:35:34.132,00:35:35.550,Stop!
00:36:02.743,00:36:06.247,HENRY: Don't let him down! Don't let him down!
00:36:17.758,00:36:19.093,ANDERSON: Watch it.
00:36:19.719,00:36:20.887,JONES: How we gonna make it up this?
00:36:21.053,00:36:22.054,FITZGERALD: Slow down.
00:36:22.221,00:36:24.765,"ANDERSON: It's killing us, captain!"
00:36:31.856,00:36:33.691,"HENRY: Lift it, Bridger!"
00:36:34.525,00:36:36.360,"FITZGERALD: Goddamn it, keep it steady."
00:36:40.531,00:36:41.991,HENRY: And heave!
00:36:43.326,00:36:45.369,JONES: I'll go up and pull.
00:36:51.792,00:36:53.377,My foot!
00:36:53.711,00:36:55.379,Enough of this shit!
00:36:55.713,00:36:58.382,"We'll never make it across like this, captain."
00:36:58.716,00:37:00.009,He's burning up.
00:37:02.220,00:37:05.139,"Cap'n, you ain't doing us nor him no favors..."
00:37:05.389,00:37:08.142,...by letting him go on suffering like this.
00:37:09.477,00:37:11.896,"Captain, it's all the same up here."
00:37:12.230,00:37:15.691,We're gonna have to go back. Find another way.
00:37:23.074,00:37:25.409,Glass. Hugh.
00:37:26.577,00:37:28.913,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
00:37:29.580,00:37:31.916,"Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. Bridger."
00:37:32.250,00:37:33.251,HAWK: What?
00:37:33.417,00:37:35.586,HENRY: Lay the rag over his eyes. HAWK: Wait!
00:37:35.753,00:37:36.754,"HENRY: I'm sorry, Hugh."
00:37:37.004,00:37:38.673,"JIM: Sir, I can't do that."
00:37:38.839,00:37:41.968,HAWK: How do we get back without him? Only he knows the way.
00:37:42.260,00:37:44.095,HENRY: Lay the rag over his eyes. JIM: I can't.
00:37:44.262,00:37:51.602,Wait! How do we get back-- HENRY: Lay it over his eyes!
00:37:52.103,00:37:53.604,Step back.
00:38:00.611,00:38:03.281,Captain. Captain. Please. Please leave....
00:38:13.457,00:38:17.628,There's a $70 bonus from the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to the two men...
00:38:17.962,00:38:20.131,...that stay with Glass to see this through.
00:38:21.465,00:38:23.634,"Me too. Money or not, I'll stay."
00:38:24.802,00:38:26.304,I'll need a third.
00:38:26.637,00:38:27.638,"Sorry, captain."
00:38:27.888,00:38:31.142,I have a family. I'm not crazy.
00:38:31.809,00:38:34.687,"Captain, three men can't hold off a party of Ree..."
00:38:34.854,00:38:36.647,...much less some boys.
00:38:36.981,00:38:40.067,"Besides, $70 ain't gonna buy nobody a new set of ears."
00:38:40.234,00:38:41.569,"A hundred, then."
00:38:42.320,00:38:44.322,This man is the only reason we're still alive.
00:38:44.655,00:38:49.076,We were 45 men when this started. Now we're ten. Almost nine.
00:38:49.410,00:38:51.162,HAWK: He's my father. He can have my share.
00:38:51.495,00:38:53.998,JIM: Mine too. He can have my share also.
00:38:58.669,00:38:59.920,All right.
00:39:00.421,00:39:03.424,"If Mr. Bridger feels the same way, I'll lag behind with them."
00:39:03.674,00:39:04.675,-You? -Yep.
00:39:05.009,00:39:07.011,You already lost my share of the pelts...
00:39:07.178,00:39:10.514,...so I got no choice but to make it up by some other means.
00:39:10.848,00:39:13.851,Sticking around for another day or two don't make no difference.
00:39:14.185,00:39:16.520,"$300, at least I get to go home with something."
00:39:16.771,00:39:19.690,"Glass is to be cared for until, understood?"
00:39:20.024,00:39:22.693,Yeah. You have my word. I understand.
00:39:24.278,00:39:25.654,HENRY: You boys get him down off this slope...
00:39:25.821,00:39:27.698,...and somewhere safe before dark.
00:39:28.032,00:39:30.368,-Fitzgerald. FITZGERALD: Captain.
00:39:31.827,00:39:34.372,Glass is to be cared for as long as necessary.
00:39:34.705,00:39:36.582,And a proper burial when it's time.
00:39:36.749,00:39:37.875,He's earned it.
00:39:38.709,00:39:40.127,I understand.
00:39:43.381,00:39:44.882,You hurt yourself?
00:39:45.633,00:39:47.051,ANDERSON: I'll be fine.
00:40:00.898,00:40:06.237,Remember what mother used to say about the wind?
00:40:07.530,00:40:12.743,The wind cannot defeat a tree with strong roots.
00:40:18.457,00:40:22.670,You are still breathing...
00:40:25.297,00:40:29.718,I miss her so much.
00:40:54.368,00:40:56.454,I'm right here.
00:41:00.875,00:41:05.921,"As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight."
00:41:07.339,00:41:09.758,You breathe. Keep breathing.
00:41:16.599,00:41:21.479,And you stand in front of a tree...
00:41:26.525,00:41:33.532,"If you look at the branches, you swear it will fall."
00:41:43.250,00:41:50.508,"But if you watch the trunk, you will see its stability."
00:42:33.217,00:42:36.387,FITZGERALD: Three hundred bucks goes a long way toward retirement.
00:42:36.720,00:42:41.225,"Go down to Texas, find me a decent piece of land, and start pissing in the wind."
00:42:42.226,00:42:45.354,Get me the hell out of this godforsaken place.
00:42:49.775,00:42:51.443,JIM: Ree done that to you?
00:42:53.279,00:42:54.655,I'm just asking.
00:42:55.656,00:42:57.324,"Yeah, they done it."
00:42:57.950,00:43:00.494,They took their sweet time with it.
00:43:01.620,00:43:04.790,"At the start, I didn't feel nothing. I just heard the sound..."
00:43:05.124,00:43:08.294,...of the knife scraping against my skull...
00:43:08.627,00:43:12.131,...and them all laughing and whooping and hollering and whatnot.
00:43:12.464,00:43:13.966,Then the blood came.
00:43:14.300,00:43:18.637,"It was cold. It started streaming down my face, in my eyes..."
00:43:19.013,00:43:20.639,...and breathing it in.
00:43:21.140,00:43:22.808,Choking on it.
00:43:23.976,00:43:25.978,That's when I felt it.
00:43:26.478,00:43:28.647,"Yeah, felt all of it."
00:43:29.315,00:43:31.817,I got my head turned inside out.
00:43:32.693,00:43:33.694,JIM: Jesus.
00:43:33.986,00:43:35.988,Them Indians down Texas way...
00:43:36.322,00:43:39.158,"...they may rob you, but they ain't gonna take your topknot."
00:43:40.367,00:43:41.869,JIM: When was it?
00:43:45.164,00:43:50.002,"Goddamn it, will you quit that noise now, will you?"
00:43:50.336,00:43:51.503,Quit it.
00:44:17.029,00:44:18.489,FITZGERALD: I'm falling further back...
00:44:18.656,00:44:21.200,...from Henry and the boys on account of tending to you.
00:44:25.704,00:44:29.375,"Got to get up the damn mountain, but winter keeps chasing us down."
00:44:32.211,00:44:35.547,If you ready to take the sacrament...
00:44:36.715,00:44:38.717,...I can do that for you.
00:44:43.889,00:44:45.933,"What you holding to, Glass?"
00:44:49.561,00:44:50.729,You know...
00:44:51.438,00:44:53.107,...it would be better...
00:44:53.440,00:44:56.568,...if you were to take that last breath of yours now...
00:44:56.735,00:44:58.112,...for all of us.
00:45:00.739,00:45:02.574,Now you hung tough.
00:45:02.908,00:45:04.451,And that's something.
00:45:05.577,00:45:06.912,I'm begging you.
00:45:07.121,00:45:11.417,Them Ree are so close I can smell 'em. You can smell 'em too.
00:45:11.625,00:45:15.754,You got to think of your boy. All right? 'Cause you're gonna kill him.
00:45:16.088,00:45:18.090,You'll kill us all.
00:45:25.139,00:45:27.266,I can muzzle you if you like.
00:45:27.599,00:45:32.438,Take away this suffering quick and easy. No one ever has to know that you give up.
00:45:33.605,00:45:36.650,All you have to do is blink if you want me to do that.
00:45:42.948,00:45:45.159,Save your boy and blink.
00:45:54.960,00:45:57.296,You just have to blink.
00:46:02.301,00:46:04.636,Yeah. There it is.
00:46:05.137,00:46:08.640,"You'd best hope the good Lord'll get His ass here quick, huh?"
00:46:12.519,00:46:14.688,"Maybe He'll forgive your sins, maybe not."
00:46:14.980,00:46:16.982,Thus I do commend thee to the Lord.
00:46:18.650,00:46:22.988,Through Jesus Christ the Lord of all reality and mercy...
00:46:23.363,00:46:32.664,"...and the Father and the Creator, I hold thee-- You okay? Jim! Jim! Help!"
00:46:43.759,00:46:46.178,HAWK: Help! -Calm down.
00:46:46.345,00:46:48.013,Jim! Help!
00:46:48.347,00:46:50.849,Don't shout! You're gonna get us all killed!
00:46:51.016,00:46:53.352,Keep away! I'll tell the captain what you did.
00:46:53.519,00:46:54.853,They'll hang you!
00:46:55.187,00:46:59.525,"-They'll hang you! Jim, help! -We have an understanding."
00:47:03.237,00:47:05.364,What's fucking wrong with you people?
00:47:16.041,00:47:17.376,Shit.
00:48:18.270,00:48:20.272,"JIM: I got one beaver, Hawk."
00:48:22.107,00:48:23.775,Breathing changed?
00:48:25.444,00:48:27.279,I hadn't noticed.
00:48:28.614,00:48:30.449,"Damn, he's cold as ice."
00:48:32.117,00:48:36.955,"Here you go, Mr. Glass. This will help you. Keep you warm."
00:48:37.956,00:48:39.291,It's all right.
00:48:41.168,00:48:42.628,Where's Hawk?
00:48:43.962,00:48:45.505,He ain't with you?
00:48:46.798,00:48:47.799,No.
00:48:47.966,00:48:48.967,No?
00:48:54.306,00:48:56.141,"I understand, Mr. Glass."
00:48:56.475,00:48:59.478,It's all right. I think I'll get a fire going.
00:48:59.811,00:49:02.314,FITZGERALD: Yeah. Sounds like a good idea.
00:49:08.487,00:49:09.821,JIM: Hawk!
00:49:13.158,00:49:14.493,Hawk!
00:49:37.849,00:49:40.560,There's about 20 of them down by the creek.
00:49:40.852,00:49:44.690,They're headed this way. Grab your shit and let's go.
00:49:46.400,00:49:48.694,Shit. What do we do?
00:49:49.027,00:49:50.529,"FITZGERALD: Run, right now."
00:49:50.862,00:49:53.865,-What about Hawk? -He ain't our problem no more.
00:49:54.074,00:49:55.409,We can't just leave him.
00:49:55.575,00:49:59.579,"Either he's gutted or scalped. And if he ain't he can find us, can't he?"
00:49:59.913,00:50:01.581,What about Glass?
00:50:01.915,00:50:04.084,"He ain't our problem. Like us, he's on his own."
00:50:04.376,00:50:08.547,We made a promise to the captain. A proper burial when the time was needed.
00:50:08.714,00:50:10.549,He needs that rifle!
00:50:10.716,00:50:14.720,He couldn't do nothing with it if you tarred it to his hand.
00:50:15.053,00:50:16.555,We can't do this.
00:50:16.888,00:50:18.390,We got no fucking choice.
00:50:18.598,00:50:20.559,"JIM: No, we can't. Look at him."
00:50:22.728,00:50:26.398,"All right, shit, then, buddy. Get him up. You want to take him?"
00:50:29.234,00:50:30.736,Come on now!
00:50:30.902,00:50:33.780,"JIM: Easy. Slowly, Fitz. Easy with him."
00:50:36.241,00:50:37.743,FITZGERALD: Just get your shit.
00:50:37.909,00:50:38.910,Get your shit!
00:50:40.245,00:50:41.580,Shut up.
00:50:45.417,00:50:46.793,Shut up!
00:50:47.419,00:50:48.587,JIM: Hold up!
00:50:51.423,00:50:53.592,Fitz. What are you doing?
00:50:53.759,00:50:57.471,What does it look like? Proper burial. Like you wanted.
00:50:57.804,00:50:59.431,"JIM: No, not like this."
00:50:59.765,00:51:00.932,FITZGERALD: Why not?
00:51:01.808,00:51:04.269,"He's alive, Fitz. He's alive."
00:51:06.605,00:51:07.939,So shoot him.
00:51:20.827,00:51:22.829,I have to go. I have to go.
00:51:23.955,00:51:26.291,"I'm sorry, Mr. Glass. I'm sorry."
00:51:27.167,00:51:28.960,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
00:51:43.475,00:51:45.644,MURPHY: Captain! This way!
00:51:46.645,00:51:49.147,There's a path down here!
00:51:50.816,00:51:53.985,ANDERSON: There ain't shit down there! We got to climb over!
00:51:54.194,00:51:58.156,JONES: Glass said to stay east! ANDERSON: Glass can go to hell!
00:51:58.990,00:52:00.325,HENRY: What's the map say?
00:52:00.492,00:52:04.329,"Keep climbing. We climb, Captain. We keep climbing."
00:52:04.663,00:52:06.498,Till we reach Old Gabe.
00:52:10.669,00:52:12.003,We climb.
00:52:13.338,00:52:14.840,We got to wait for Murph.
00:52:15.173,00:52:16.842,ANDERSON: Yeah. You wait for him.
00:52:17.676,00:52:19.010,Captain?
00:52:22.013,00:52:23.014,Sir...
00:52:23.348,00:52:27.018,...Murphy says there's a way down there. Who we following?
00:52:27.352,00:52:30.397,ANDERSON: You follow who you want! I'm going up!
00:52:31.523,00:52:32.899,"Stubby, keep going up!"
00:52:33.066,00:52:35.360,JONES: Murph! Come here!
00:56:03.359,00:56:05.904,I'm right here.
00:57:11.803,00:57:13.304,FITZGERALD: Fire's done.
00:57:14.139,00:57:16.307,I can't even feel my feet.
00:57:18.476,00:57:21.312,Didn't we put enough distance between us and them Ree?
00:57:21.479,00:57:24.482,A dozen Ree can make twice as good time as we can.
00:57:24.732,00:57:26.484,-Twenty. -What?
00:57:28.486,00:57:30.238,You said you saw twenty Ree.
00:57:30.405,00:57:32.657,Yeah? What you talking about?
00:57:35.660,00:57:37.245,-You woke me up. -Mm-hm.
00:57:38.496,00:57:40.665,You said you saw twenty Ree by the creek.
00:57:40.999,00:57:42.667,"Well, yeah, twenty, a dozen..."
00:57:43.001,00:57:47.672,...it don't matter. I wasn't gonna hang around counting fucking feathers.
00:57:50.675,00:57:52.093,As a matter of fact...
00:57:53.845,00:57:56.598,...what was you doing down by the creek all by yourself?
00:57:57.432,00:57:59.684,I'd already brought up plenty of water.
00:58:01.394,00:58:02.645,Hey!
00:58:03.688,00:58:06.191,"Answer me, Fitzgerald. I asked you a question."
00:58:07.442,00:58:10.195,Don't question me on account of you feel guilty.
00:58:10.528,00:58:12.614,Answer me or I'll blow your head off.
00:58:12.864,00:58:15.033,"You got a short memory, boy."
00:58:15.533,00:58:17.785,Your ass would be floating around the Missouri right now...
00:58:17.952,00:58:19.537,...if it wasn't for me.
00:58:21.539,00:58:23.500,You want to ask questions?
00:58:23.666,00:58:25.960,"What you want to ask? If you want to know, ask it."
00:58:26.211,00:58:27.420,Hmm?
00:58:27.587,00:58:31.049,"You want to know why you left Mr. Glass back there for dead, huh?"
00:58:31.382,00:58:34.385,Or why you left your little boyfriend running around?
00:58:34.719,00:58:37.555,You want to know if he's still alive?
00:58:37.889,00:58:40.058,I'll tell you why. It's 'cause you ain't a man yet.
00:58:40.391,00:58:43.811,It's 'cause you was scared shitless. You're scared now.
00:58:44.145,00:58:45.146,The Ree.
00:58:45.396,00:58:46.731,What of them?
00:58:47.565,00:58:49.400,"Tell me, did you see 'em?"
00:58:49.567,00:58:51.736,-Put your rifle down. -Did you see the Ree?
00:58:53.905,00:58:55.156,No.
00:58:56.407,00:58:58.243,Not a single one.
00:59:00.828,00:59:04.374,You fucking lied to me? You lied to me!
00:59:08.169,00:59:10.755,"I had to scare some sense into you, boy."
00:59:11.089,00:59:13.258,Glass was dead. Hawk we don't know about.
00:59:13.591,00:59:16.261,"No point in either of us dying either, you understand?"
00:59:16.594,00:59:20.932,"The way I see it, I saved your life twice now. I ought to be God to you."
00:59:21.599,00:59:24.769,And God giveth and God taketh away.
00:59:32.193,00:59:33.778,Lucky fucker.
00:59:34.946,00:59:37.782,Next time you want to shoot somebody...
00:59:38.116,00:59:41.786,"...you might want to use powder, prime your rifle."
00:59:44.789,00:59:48.459,Come on. Let's git. Grab your shit.
01:03:49.575,01:03:53.621,Fresh blood. This could be Powaqa.
01:04:17.728,01:04:19.146,Let's go.
01:14:27.921,01:14:29.256,Who did this?
01:14:29.423,01:14:31.425,FITZGERALD: I don't know.
01:14:38.432,01:14:41.602,Could be Captain Leavenworth's boys.
01:14:42.478,01:14:44.271,Mmm. Yeah.
01:14:45.606,01:14:48.066,Put some eyes on the back of your head.
01:14:51.236,01:14:54.573,These Injuns ain't never as dead as you think they are.
01:14:55.282,01:14:58.911,"Look at 'em, huh? They're always stealing our shit."
01:15:35.280,01:15:37.449,FITZGERALD: We got horses over here!
01:15:41.620,01:15:43.121,"Hey, Bridger."
01:15:48.627,01:15:50.170,We got horses!
01:15:55.968,01:15:58.011,JIM: What you want to do about these pigs?
01:16:04.810,01:16:07.312,"FITZGERALD: The Lord's on our side, kid."
01:16:15.654,01:16:17.197,"FITZGERALD: You all right there, kid?"
01:16:17.531,01:16:19.491,Your head in the right place?
01:16:20.158,01:16:21.493,I guess.
01:16:26.540,01:16:31.545,I can't help thinking about whether we did the right-- Ain't our place to wonder. The good Lord...
01:16:31.878,01:16:35.173,...got us on a road whether we choose it or not.
01:16:38.385,01:16:41.555,"My pop, he weren't a religious man, you know?"
01:16:41.888,01:16:46.893,"If you couldn't grow it, kill it, or eat it, he just plain old didn't believe in it."
01:16:47.728,01:16:52.733,And this one time he head on up the old Saba hills. San Saba hills?
01:16:53.400,01:16:57.070,He joined a couple Texas Ranger buddies of his to hunt.
01:16:57.404,01:17:00.574,Pretty routine. He done it like a hundred times before.
01:17:00.866,01:17:03.702,"Should have been a 3-day kill, but on the second day..."
01:17:03.869,01:17:05.746,...it all went fucked.
01:17:06.079,01:17:08.332,Somehow that night he lost his buddies.
01:17:08.498,01:17:10.083,And to top it off...
01:17:10.417,01:17:12.919,...them Comanches went and took the horses.
01:17:13.712,01:17:16.214,So he was starving and delirious...
01:17:16.423,01:17:20.093,...and he crawls up into this mott...
01:17:20.427,01:17:22.638,...this group of trees out in the middle of nowhere...
01:17:22.804,01:17:25.390,...just sticking up in this ocean of scrub...
01:17:25.599,01:17:27.768,...and he found religion.
01:17:28.727,01:17:31.438,"At that moment, he told me..."
01:17:31.772,01:17:33.607,...he found God.
01:17:35.609,01:17:36.777,Uh-huh.
01:17:40.280,01:17:43.617,And it turns out that God....
01:17:44.743,01:17:46.411,He's a squirrel.
01:17:47.454,01:17:50.123,"Yeah. A big, old meaty one."
01:17:52.751,01:17:55.295,"I found God, he used to say."
01:17:56.421,01:18:01.426,And while sitting there and basking in the glory and sublimity of mercy...
01:18:02.803,01:18:05.597,...I shot and ate that son of a bitch.
01:18:14.815,01:18:15.982,Mmm.
01:18:18.151,01:18:21.321,"Yeah. You might want to close your eyes, kid."
01:27:13.895,01:27:15.605,A bear.
01:27:16.731,01:27:18.441,A bear.
01:27:24.280,01:27:25.782,Grizzly.
01:27:43.758,01:27:46.261,Killed my son.
01:27:49.389,01:27:54.352,I lost my family too.
01:27:54.769,01:27:57.397,Sioux killed my people.
01:27:58.523,01:28:05.488,I'm going south to find more Pawnee.
01:28:08.783,01:28:12.245,My heart bleeds...
01:28:13.788,01:28:17.625,But revenge is in the creator's hands.
01:28:25.466,01:28:27.218,You will ride with me...
01:29:35.161,01:29:37.038,HIKUC: Your body is rotten.
01:29:37.830,01:29:39.457,Need to heal.
01:29:45.004,01:29:46.422,You could die.
01:30:01.104,01:30:04.107,FITZGERALD: Yeah! There she is.
01:30:05.483,01:30:06.943,We did it.
01:30:07.944,01:30:10.446,"You ought to be proud of yourself, boy."
01:30:11.447,01:30:12.448,Yeah.
01:30:12.615,01:30:15.952,We followed orders. We just skipped the funeral part.
01:30:16.285,01:30:19.664,Don't go down there and start growing no conscience.
01:30:19.997,01:30:23.501,'Cause sure as night'll come they'll have us swinging from a couple ropes.
01:30:23.793,01:30:26.462,We did what we had to do.
01:30:31.259,01:30:32.385,Come on.
01:30:54.115,01:30:56.450,FITZGERALD: We had the extra day so we managed to dig...
01:30:56.701,01:30:59.871,"...a little deeper, lay rocks on top so scavengers couldn't get at him."
01:31:00.037,01:31:03.291,It was done right and all. He was buried right.
01:31:04.625,01:31:07.086,"-Sir, can we-- -The truth is that..."
01:31:07.253,01:31:11.632,"...ahem, when Hawk disappeared, I was worried about savages."
01:31:11.883,01:31:15.136,"And I was ready to get, to move on out."
01:31:15.469,01:31:19.807,"Yeah, but Bridger here argued to stay."
01:31:20.141,01:31:22.143,He argued to stay...
01:31:22.476,01:31:25.479,...so he could at least build a cross or something...
01:31:25.813,01:31:30.484,"...to put on top of Glass's grave, and that's what he did. That's what we did."
01:31:30.651,01:31:32.904,"I'm glad you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger."
01:31:33.154,01:31:37.825,"He more than pulled his weight, captain. This man here, he was my partner."
01:31:40.244,01:31:41.370,All right.
01:31:43.331,01:31:47.168,Am I to assume that the agreed arrangement did not change?
01:31:47.501,01:31:50.296,"Uh, fortunately for me, it did not."
01:31:50.463,01:31:51.631,HENRY: Mm-hm.
01:32:12.193,01:32:13.694,Thank you...
01:32:14.028,01:32:18.032,"...for your courage, honor, and service."
01:32:19.200,01:32:23.037,"Deal or no deal, Mr. Bridger, you deserve something for what you did."
01:32:23.371,01:32:24.705,Thank you.
01:32:35.007,01:32:39.053,Kid's been beating himself up awful bad the whole trip.
01:32:42.056,01:32:44.058,We all saw the shape Glass was in.
01:32:44.308,01:32:46.894,There was no more to be done. Right?
01:32:47.395,01:32:48.396,FITZGERALD: Yeah.
01:32:49.897,01:32:51.023,We all saw him.
01:36:17.563,01:36:23.277,WIFE: When there is a storm...
01:36:24.528,01:36:30.075,And you stand in front of a tree...
01:36:31.285,01:36:37.500,"If you look at its branches, you swear it will fall."
01:36:43.380,01:36:51.388,"But if you watch the trunk, you will see its stability."
01:42:16.171,01:42:19.174,There are traces of a camp...
01:42:20.175,01:42:21.218,Where?
01:42:21.385,01:42:24.555,Entering the moon forest.
01:42:24.972,01:42:28.934,Maybe from two days ago. They are moving east.
01:42:29.893,01:42:31.645,Tell the others.
01:42:32.354,01:42:35.732,Let's move quickly. Powaqa could be with them!
01:42:59.506,01:43:01.842,Those five horses weren't for free.
01:44:23.006,01:44:24.508,Shh.
01:45:13.849,01:45:16.268,GLASS: Come here...
01:46:07.486,01:46:09.446,FITZGERALD: May I join you? HENRY: Yes.
01:46:09.654,01:46:11.656,-Yeah? -Yes.
01:46:11.823,01:46:15.494,I was wondering when we might be getting paid for that haul.
01:46:15.827,01:46:19.998,"'Cause them pelts we collected are still out there, you know..."
01:46:20.332,01:46:24.503,...under a couple foot of dirt and snow. But that ain't my fault.
01:46:24.836,01:46:27.839,I'm waiting for Captain Leavenworth to arrive with his army.
01:46:28.173,01:46:30.175,Then we'll have enough men...
01:46:30.509,01:46:35.013,...to shoot some civilization into those fucking Arikara and get back our pelts.
01:46:35.305,01:46:37.349,All right. All right.
01:46:37.849,01:46:40.185,When's that supposed to happen?
01:46:40.519,01:46:41.853,I don't know.
01:46:42.187,01:46:44.356,"But until then, nobody gets paid."
01:46:46.691,01:46:48.693,"Listen here, all right?"
01:46:49.027,01:46:52.697,I was hired to trap 'em. I wasn't hired to guard 'em.
01:46:53.031,01:46:57.369,"The way I see it, now you, you got a safe."
01:46:57.661,01:46:59.371,It's probably full of money.
01:46:59.663,01:47:02.207,You signed a contract to protect your boss...
01:47:02.374,01:47:04.543,...and your boss's property.
01:47:05.210,01:47:08.547,And that safe isn't full anymore. It's short about $300.
01:47:09.548,01:47:11.883,What the hell is that supposed to mean?
01:47:12.217,01:47:13.885,"It means, according to my records..."
01:47:14.219,01:47:16.096,...you purchased more goods on the expedition...
01:47:16.263,01:47:18.557,...than what you are owed by the company.
01:47:23.395,01:47:25.564,"Now, Happy New Year, Fitzgerald."
01:49:48.290,01:49:49.833,"Hyah, hyah!"
01:56:31.859,01:56:34.946,GUARD: Fryman! White man at the gate!
01:56:47.542,01:56:48.876,Speak English.
01:56:51.546,01:56:52.880,Open her up!
01:56:53.214,01:56:54.340,Get the captain!
01:56:54.507,01:56:55.591,HENRY: Where are your men?
01:56:56.884,01:56:58.177,All dead.
01:56:58.344,01:56:59.345,Who was he?
01:56:59.971,01:57:02.473,"I don't know. Something to eat, please?"
01:57:02.724,01:57:04.308,Food comes at a price.
01:57:05.393,01:57:08.062,-I have no money. -Then you don't eat.
01:57:08.396,01:57:11.065,Give back some of them stolen pelts you buy from the Injuns.
01:57:11.232,01:57:12.567,"-Not now, Jones. -Huh?"
01:57:12.900,01:57:14.902,Silver. How is this? Silver.
01:57:17.905,01:57:19.323,This all you got?
01:57:21.409,01:57:23.411,We was nine.
01:57:23.745,01:57:26.247,"My friend, he die in the snow."
01:57:26.581,01:57:28.583,And the other was...
01:57:28.916,01:57:30.918,...kill by wolf. I see it.
01:57:31.252,01:57:33.421,"By wolf, yeah, kill."
01:57:33.755,01:57:35.339,Where'd you get this?
01:57:35.923,01:57:37.258,Canteen.
01:57:37.508,01:57:44.265,"He drop it. He kill Toussaint, he drop it-- -Who? Who? -I don't know. I don't see."
01:57:45.933,01:57:47.268,It could be Hawk.
01:57:49.604,01:57:50.938,"Yeah, could be."
01:57:51.105,01:57:53.107,JONES: That half-breed runt couldn't steal no horse.
01:57:53.274,01:57:54.859,-Maybe it was Weston. STUBBY BILL: Or Beckett.
01:57:55.026,01:57:56.360,How far from here?
01:57:56.527,01:57:57.820,Thirty mile.
01:57:57.987,01:57:59.530,"Northwest, near the Yellowstone."
01:57:59.697,01:58:00.990,The Yellowstone!
01:58:01.324,01:58:03.659,Get the horses saddled. Torches and supplies.
01:58:03.826,01:58:05.369,Ten dollars a man.
01:58:05.703,01:58:07.205,"Anderson, you stay here."
01:58:07.371,01:58:10.500,"ANDERSON: Yes, sir. Feed him and watch him."
01:58:11.542,01:58:13.211,I'll get you a drink.
01:58:29.185,01:58:32.522,"HENRY: When we get to the Yellowstone, we split into two groups!"
01:58:43.908,01:58:45.243,HENRY: Hawk!
01:58:45.535,01:58:47.370,"JIM: Hawk, you out there?"
01:58:55.128,01:58:57.088,MAN: Whoa! Whoa!
01:59:04.387,01:59:06.222,HENRY: Keep your guard up!
01:59:07.932,01:59:09.433,Eyes in front!
01:59:21.070,01:59:22.572,Who are you?
01:59:22.780,01:59:24.615,FRYMAN: Beckett? Is that you?
01:59:36.419,01:59:37.587,HENRY: Glass?
01:59:38.796,01:59:39.797,Glass!
01:59:40.590,01:59:41.841,Jesus Christ!
01:59:42.258,01:59:44.093,"Jesus Christ, what happened?"
01:59:49.265,01:59:51.267,"HENRY: Jones, take him. Go."
01:59:52.101,01:59:54.937,"I'm riding ahead. Bill, take Bridger."
01:59:55.938,01:59:57.440,Take Bridger!
02:00:11.621,02:00:13.789,"-Have you seen Fitzgerald? -No, sir."
02:00:19.837,02:00:21.964,Get up. Get up!
02:00:22.131,02:00:23.799,"-You seen Fitzgerald? -No, sir."
02:00:24.008,02:00:25.134,Fitzgerald?
02:00:34.977,02:00:36.312,"Whoa, easy."
02:00:36.479,02:00:37.813,Where did he go?
02:00:38.981,02:00:41.484,-Who? -Fitzgerald. Where did he go?
02:00:41.817,02:00:44.320,-I have no idea. -Tell me or I'll take your head off.
02:00:44.654,02:00:48.199,I swear to God-- Tell me. Tell me!
02:00:48.491,02:00:49.659,Texas!
02:00:49.992,02:00:53.871,He said he was going to Texas. He said he was gonna reenlist.
02:00:54.205,02:00:57.500,Then he started talking about property. A decent piece of land.
02:00:57.833,02:01:00.169,He's heading for Texas. That's all I know.
02:01:00.336,02:01:01.671,Stay here.
02:01:04.715,02:01:06.217,Fitzgerald!
02:01:07.551,02:01:09.220,Fitzgerald!
02:01:37.748,02:01:39.250,Goddamn it!
02:01:42.044,02:01:43.587,Goddamn it!
02:01:44.255,02:01:47.216,GUARD: Jones! Get the Captain!
02:01:47.383,02:01:49.552,-Fryman! JONES: Open the gate!
02:01:49.760,02:01:51.262,GUARD: Open it up!
02:01:53.055,02:01:54.890,"JONES: Murphy, get the Captain."
02:02:01.105,02:02:03.733,HENRY: Get him to the doctor. Now!
02:02:04.900,02:02:08.404,You said he was dead! You said he was dead!
02:02:08.612,02:02:10.740,"I thought he was, I swear!"
02:02:11.615,02:02:14.452,JIM: He lied to me! HENRY: You're a liar.
02:02:14.744,02:02:17.288,You left him out there!
02:02:18.122,02:02:19.915,Say the Lord's Prayer.
02:02:20.249,02:02:22.418,Say the Lord's Prayer!
02:02:23.461,02:02:27.757,"Our Father, Who art in heaven. Who art-- I can't!"
02:02:28.090,02:02:29.759,Shut up! Shut up!
02:02:30.092,02:02:32.762,"From here out, you're a prisoner charged with treason!"
02:02:33.095,02:02:37.433,Take him to the cage! Take him to the cage or you'll hang alongside him!
02:02:37.767,02:02:39.810,I thought he was gonna die!
02:02:41.145,02:02:42.938,Fitz lied to me!
02:02:43.981,02:02:45.441,I couldn't help him!
02:02:49.153,02:02:50.488,Glass!
02:02:50.654,02:02:52.406,Fitz lied to me!
02:03:22.812,02:03:23.854,How is he?
02:03:24.021,02:03:26.690,"DOCTOR: He'll be fine, but there is swelling. He needs to rest."
02:03:26.857,02:03:28.859,I'll be back to check up on him.
02:03:38.202,02:03:40.496,"GLASS: He ran off, didn't he?"
02:03:49.046,02:03:51.382,Bridger's telling the truth.
02:03:53.217,02:03:54.593,How's that?
02:03:55.177,02:03:59.348,Fitzgerald lied to him. He was just following orders.
02:04:01.016,02:04:04.019,He wasn't there when Fitzgerald stabbed my boy to death.
02:04:08.858,02:04:10.443,Is that what happened?
02:04:12.695,02:04:14.196,He killed Hawk.
02:04:18.284,02:04:19.869,I need a horse and gun.
02:04:20.119,02:04:23.456,"No, you need to rest and eat. I'm going after him."
02:04:23.622,02:04:24.874,No.
02:04:26.041,02:04:27.710,You'll never find him without me.
02:04:28.043,02:04:30.796,If we wait till morning he'll get away.
02:04:30.963,02:04:32.548,"No, he won't."
02:04:33.549,02:04:35.384,He's afraid.
02:04:36.385,02:04:39.388,He knows how far I came for him.
02:04:40.639,02:04:41.724,Same as that elk.
02:04:41.891,02:04:45.144,"When they get afraid, they run deep into the woods."
02:04:45.728,02:04:49.732,I got him trapped. He just doesn't know it yet.
02:04:50.065,02:04:51.901,How can you be so sure?
02:04:52.651,02:04:55.488,'Cause he has everything to lose.
02:04:57.573,02:05:00.075,All I had was that boy.
02:05:01.243,02:05:03.412,And he took him from me.
02:05:06.832,02:05:10.836,I can't let you go back out there. Not again.
02:05:14.089,02:05:16.759,I ain't afraid to die anymore.
02:05:18.594,02:05:20.513,I done it already.
02:05:26.101,02:05:28.020,I'm going with you.
02:06:33.502,02:06:34.628,Hyah.
02:06:43.304,02:06:45.514,"GLASS: That's his horse, all right."
02:06:47.850,02:06:50.519,No way he could've ridden through the night.
02:06:50.853,02:06:52.605,HENRY: How far ahead?
02:06:53.188,02:06:55.190,Half a day at the most.
02:06:55.524,02:06:59.695,"Could be Ree. If they aren't his, we lose him."
02:07:00.362,02:07:04.033,Unless he reenlisted so he could justify killing again...
02:07:04.366,02:07:06.327,...these tracks right here are his.
02:07:08.287,02:07:09.747,Come on.
02:07:16.712,02:07:19.214,HENRY: I can't remember my wife's face.
02:07:20.049,02:07:22.551,"Last week, she was still with me."
02:07:24.136,02:07:25.888,Now she's gone.
02:07:28.891,02:07:32.227,I worry I won't recognize her when I get back home.
02:07:44.406,02:07:46.742,Is it true you killed an officer?
02:07:51.413,02:07:54.917,I just killed the man who was trying to kill my son.
02:08:13.519,02:08:14.853,Smoke.
02:08:16.105,02:08:17.523,How close?
02:08:22.194,02:08:24.446,No more than a mile up that way.
02:08:24.613,02:08:27.950,I'm gonna head up to the west. You go down to the east.
02:08:28.283,02:08:30.703,See if we can find some tracks.
02:08:31.954,02:08:33.372,And if it's the Ree?
02:08:33.872,02:08:36.250,"If it's the Ree, you turn right back around..."
02:08:36.417,02:08:38.210,...and meet me back here. Tsk.
02:10:06.048,02:10:08.884,"Now, I wouldn't expect to find a man of your stature..."
02:10:09.218,02:10:12.387,"...so far away from his stove on a morning as cold as this, captain."
02:10:12.554,02:10:13.889,You lost?
02:10:14.056,02:10:16.558,I'm here to take you back to Fort Kiowa...
02:10:16.892,02:10:19.061,...where you will be tried for murder.
02:10:19.394,02:10:20.729,Is that so?
02:10:20.979,02:10:23.232,I ain't crazy about your plan.
02:10:23.732,02:10:25.734,"Besides, I got one of my own."
02:17:54.015,02:17:56.768,"We had a deal, Glass!"
02:17:59.854,02:18:02.190,"I tried to tell your boy, all right?"
02:18:02.524,02:18:07.028,"I tried to tell him, but he wouldn't listen and he kept on screaming."
02:18:07.279,02:18:09.781,He was gonna get everybody killed.
02:18:11.366,02:18:14.703,"But you and me, we had a deal."
02:18:16.371,02:18:18.623,You know what happened out there.
02:18:19.040,02:18:22.043,"And on my soul, the Lord, He knows..."
02:18:22.377,02:18:24.212,...what happened out there.
02:18:26.715,02:18:28.717,There was no deal.
02:18:31.553,02:18:33.638,You killed my boy.
02:18:37.142,02:18:41.062,"Well, maybe you should've raised a man, instead of some girlie little bitch."
02:18:48.236,02:18:49.237,Ahh!
02:18:52.907,02:18:54.743,Goddamn it.
02:21:17.969,02:21:21.806,"You came all this way just for your revenge, huh?"
02:21:24.225,02:21:26.394,"Well, you enjoy it, Glass."
02:21:27.395,02:21:30.732,'Cause there ain't nothing gonna bring your boy back.
02:21:33.318,02:21:34.986,"No, it won't."
02:22:02.138,02:22:04.474,...not mine.
