00:00:59.727,00:01:01.102,"Bobby, you hear me?"
00:01:07.902,00:01:09.486,"Right there, motherfucker!"
00:01:26.587,00:01:28.005,LITTLE TONY: Please!
00:01:28.047,00:01:30.049,"Just fucking stop, man!"

00:01:37.056,00:01:38.097,Please.
00:01:39.140,00:01:40.809,I'm fucking begging you.
00:01:40.851,00:01:43.520,I didn't touch him!
00:02:10.130,00:02:26.021,"YOUNG CHRIS: Worse on Friday Died on Saturday Buried on Sunday That was the end Of Solomon Grundy Solomon Grundy Born on a Monday Christened on Tuesday Justine, please."
00:02:29.483,00:02:32.903,"NEUROLOGIST: It's called stimming, self-stimulation."
00:02:32.945,00:02:36.073,Whereas you and I might tap our fingers...
00:02:36.115,00:02:38.742,"grind our teeth, bite our nails..."
00:02:38.784,00:02:40.702,your son rocks back and forth.
00:02:40.744,00:02:43.664,"It's more obvious, but perfectly natural."
00:02:43.705,00:02:47.250,"We came here because we heard you specialized in, uh..."
00:02:47.292,00:02:49.336,What is it?
00:02:49.377,00:02:52.589,"I'm not a fan of labels, ma'am."
00:02:52.631,00:02:55.467,Your son is a remarkable young man.
00:02:55.509,00:02:58.386,CHRIS' MOTHER: Who goes crazy when you turn the vacuum on.
00:02:58.428,00:03:01.598,"He wears one T-shirt, won't let you hug him."
00:03:01.640,00:03:03.642,"NEUROLOGIST: Loud noises, bright lights..."
00:03:03.684,00:03:07.104,can be especially difficult for someone like your son.
00:03:07.146,00:03:10.649,"The shirt, most likely fabric sensitivity."
00:03:11.984,00:03:13.944,"Hugging, closeness, touching..."
00:03:13.986,00:03:15.194,"Justine, no shoes today."
00:03:15.236,00:03:17.114,"That can be a challenge, yes."
00:03:17.156,00:03:18.699,CHRIS' MOTHER: When it's somebody else's child...
00:03:18.740,00:03:20.742,it's a challenge.
00:03:20.784,00:03:22.577,When it's yours...
00:03:22.619,00:03:24.830,it's a problem.
00:03:24.872,00:03:27.875,My practice focuses on education.
00:03:27.916,00:03:30.878,"I'd like to work with your son, at his speed."
00:03:30.919,00:03:34.422,Help him develop the skills he'll need to lead a full life.
00:03:34.464,00:03:36.341,"Communicating, eye contact..."
00:03:36.383,00:03:38.426,understanding non-verbal cues...
00:03:38.468,00:03:40.345,making friends.
00:03:40.387,00:03:43.515,CHRIS' MOTHER: The only friend he has is his little brother.
00:03:43.557,00:03:47.102,I'm sure moving from base to base hasn't helped.
00:03:47.144,00:03:52.149,"My husband's in the Army, which means we all are."
00:03:52.191,00:03:55.318,Would you be willing to let your son stay with us for the summer...
00:03:55.360,00:03:59.114,"free of charge, working with me in a sensory-friendly environment?"
00:03:59.156,00:04:01.575,That's not gonna happen.
00:04:01.616,00:04:04.203,If loud noises and bright lights bother him...
00:04:04.244,00:04:07.372,"he needs more of it, not less."
00:04:07.414,00:04:10.584,The world is not a sensory-friendly place...
00:04:10.625,00:04:13.253,and that's where he needs to learn to live.
00:04:14.546,00:04:16.506,CHRIS' FATHER: Not in here.
00:04:16.548,00:04:18.592,"Doctor, in your opinion..."
00:04:18.633,00:04:21.469,can our son lead a normal life?
00:04:22.221,00:04:24.723,Define normal.
00:04:24.765,00:04:26.683,I need to finish!
00:04:26.725,00:04:40.864,Solomon Grundy Born on a Monday Christened on Tuesday Married on Wednesday Sick on Thursday Worse on Friday Died on Saturday Buried on Sunday I need to finish!
00:04:40.906,00:05:07.975,Solomon Grundy Born on a Monday Christened on Tuesday Married on Wednesday Sick on Thursday Worse on Friday Died on Saturday Buried on Sunday Hmm. Mmm.
00:05:23.865,00:05:27.869,"FRANK: I, uh..."
00:05:27.911,00:05:29.163,Fourth-generation farmer.
00:05:31.123,00:05:35.376,But between the property taxes...
00:05:35.418,00:05:37.838,"and the fertilizer costs, and insurance..."
00:05:43.051,00:05:44.385,"Oh, to hell with it."
00:05:44.427,00:05:46.847,"What if, just temporarily, mind you..."
00:05:46.888,00:05:49.724,we put this year's taxes on our credit card?
00:05:56.106,00:05:57.565,Do you like it?
00:05:57.607,00:05:59.067,I made it myself.
00:05:59.109,00:06:01.528,"No, not particularly."
00:06:01.569,00:06:03.155,But do you ever sell one?
00:06:03.197,00:06:04.781,At church fairs now and again.
00:06:04.823,00:06:08.243,"Mrs. Rice, you may have what the IRS calls a home-based business."
00:06:08.285,00:06:10.204,What room do you use in your house when you make those?
00:06:10.245,00:06:11.579,"I don't, really."
00:06:11.621,00:06:13.207,"Just wherever I happen to be, I guess."
00:06:13.248,00:06:15.792,"In front of the TV, at the kitchen table."
00:06:15.834,00:06:19.004,I like to spread my beads out in the dining room but Frank gets...
00:06:19.046,00:06:20.672,"Yes, it would be better if you could try to remember..."
00:06:20.714,00:06:23.258,the one specific space that you use.
00:06:23.300,00:06:25.719,Your home is 2913 square feet.
00:06:25.760,00:06:28.680,IRS code allows us to deduct from your taxable income...
00:06:28.722,00:06:31.474,a percentage of your workspace relative to your overall home.
00:06:31.516,00:06:33.018,What...
00:06:33.060,00:06:35.187,how big is your dining room?
00:06:35.229,00:06:36.897,Mrs. Rice's office.
00:06:36.938,00:06:38.940,as call it an office...
00:06:38.982,00:06:40.817,DOLORES: Oh.
00:06:40.859,00:06:43.778,"It's, uh, approximately 200, uh..."
00:06:49.951,00:06:52.204,"Well, make it 300 square feet."
00:06:52.246,00:06:53.872,Excellent. Mrs. Rice...
00:06:53.914,00:06:55.582,Dolores.
00:06:55.623,00:06:58.626,"Dolores, when you order supplies, do you order online?"
00:06:58.668,00:07:01.213,I don't. I just zip on over to the bead store.
00:07:01.255,00:07:02.714,Zip?
00:07:02.756,00:07:05.217,I drive the truck.
00:07:06.009,00:07:07.635,The company truck.
00:07:26.238,00:07:27.447,RAY: Come in.
00:07:30.075,00:07:33.494,"Mr. King, you have wandered so far outside your legal purview."
00:07:33.536,00:07:37.916,"As president of Southern Gulf Bank, I intend to protect my customers' privacy."
00:07:37.958,00:07:39.209,Stop talking.
00:07:39.251,00:07:41.795,You have a very cavalier attitude for the president of a bank...
00:07:41.836,00:07:43.380,with such a piss-poor capital cushion.
00:07:43.422,00:07:46.925,"Now, I want a record of every transaction Abayed has had for the past two years."
00:07:46.967,00:07:49.886,"Deposits, withdrawals, cashier's checks, credit cards."

00:07:53.140,00:07:54.599,Goodbye.
00:07:54.641,00:07:56.268,Medina.
00:07:56.310,00:07:57.811,Am I saying that correctly?
00:07:57.852,00:07:59.313,"Medina, yes, sir."
00:07:59.354,00:08:02.399,"I've read all your case files, Director King."

00:08:24.338,00:08:28.425,You did the heavy lifting on Agent Lorenz's case last month.
00:08:28.467,00:08:30.635,"I worked on it, yeah, but Agent Lorenz..."
00:08:30.677,00:08:33.763,Why haven't you applied for promotion to agent?
00:08:33.805,00:08:35.307,You're already doing the work.
00:08:36.350,00:08:38.143,Analyst is a good fit.

00:09:34.366,00:09:39.371,Lying on a federal employment application is a felony.
00:09:41.331,00:09:47.045,"So right now, I'm the only thing standing between you and significant prison time."
00:09:50.382,00:09:52.967,What do you want?

00:10:03.937,00:10:06.064,I got a two-acre pond that is just thick with catfish and bass...
00:10:06.106,00:10:08.567,I don't fish. I shoot.

00:11:29.439,00:11:31.983,"In that one, he's Carl Gauss."

00:12:21.241,00:12:22.741,I retire in seven months.
00:12:22.783,00:12:25.828,"Before I do, I need to know who he is."
00:12:26.621,00:12:27.914,How he does it.
00:12:27.955,00:12:30.625,"I mean, who survives this kind of clientele?"
00:12:30.667,00:12:32.586,The secrets this guy has.
00:12:34.879,00:12:37.465,What exactly do you want me to do?

00:18:38.952,00:18:42.956,"In-flec-tion. Right? Listen, just listen to my tone."
00:18:42.997,00:18:45.959,"I say, Oh, I'm another year older..."
00:18:46.000,00:18:49.712,and I don't know if I'm ever gonna get out of this fucking place.
00:18:49.754,00:18:51.380,And you say...
00:18:51.422,00:18:53.215,"You're probably right, Francis. You're extremely old."
00:18:53.257,00:18:54.717,It's unlikely you'll survive to...
00:18:54.759,00:18:57.428,No. Hold on.
00:18:57.470,00:19:00.222,together every night.
00:19:00.264,00:19:03.434,"I gave you a PhD in black money, but you gotta learn this."
00:19:03.476,00:19:05.311,This is crucial.
00:19:05.352,00:19:06.604,What am I?
00:19:07.605,00:19:08.940,That's what I am.
00:19:08.982,00:19:10.900,I'm frustrated.
00:19:10.942,00:19:13.111,Finally. All right.
00:19:14.946,00:19:18.908,ladies. Lights out.
00:19:18.950,00:19:20.618,Names and addresses. Go.

00:19:34.340,00:19:35.800,CHRIS: Ask for Bobby.
00:19:35.842,00:19:37.010,"You know, I'm old."
00:19:37.051,00:19:40.638,I may be remembering things a little rosier than they were.
00:19:40.680,00:19:44.684,You want to fill out 1040s and itemize deductions and...
00:19:44.725,00:19:46.686,pull in 50 grand a year?
00:19:46.727,00:19:49.856,"Because if you go down this road, this road..."
00:19:49.897,00:19:51.607,"you can't go back, you understand?"
00:19:51.649,00:19:53.526,It's dangerous.
00:19:53.567,00:19:55.444,CHRIS: I understand.
00:19:55.486,00:19:57.613,"FRANCIS: You find one person you can trust, just one."
00:19:57.655,00:19:59.281,And do not make my mistake.
00:19:59.323,00:20:01.534,You keep moving your ass around.
00:20:10.250,00:20:12.252,They gave me a new handler today.
00:20:13.504,00:20:15.840,I don't like this guy.
00:20:17.591,00:20:18.592,Worried.
00:20:22.930,00:20:24.849,"Ah, fuck it."
00:20:26.726,00:20:28.394,"Good night, son."
00:20:29.770,00:20:31.438,"CHRIS: Good night, Francis."
00:20:39.030,00:20:41.782,What about Zurich?
00:20:41.824,00:20:43.367,The Swiss are cheap.
00:20:43.409,00:20:46.704,"Dubai is one thing, but we're too conspicuous in the Kingdom."
00:20:46.746,00:20:48.122,Why?
00:20:48.164,00:20:49.582,There's an uptick in online chatter.
00:20:49.623,00:20:51.375,People looking for you.
00:20:51.417,00:20:53.586,What people?
00:20:53.627,00:20:56.172,Let's try a legitimate client for once.
00:20:56.214,00:21:00.093,"No cartels, arms brokers, money launderers, assassins."
00:21:00.134,00:21:03.012,I like safe.
00:21:03.054,00:21:04.680,CHRIS: Everyone's hiding something.
00:21:04.722,00:21:06.599,At least there's honor among thieves.
00:21:06.640,00:21:10.561,There's honor among Illinois electronics manufacturers.
00:21:10.603,00:21:12.230,They're in your current back yard.
00:21:12.271,00:21:14.732,No risk of movement.
00:21:15.733,00:21:17.276,"CHRIS: Yeah, I'll meet."
00:21:17.317,00:21:19.070,One last piece of business.
00:21:19.112,00:21:20.487,Just the Renoir.
00:21:20.529,00:21:22.281,I don't have a buyer for the Renoir.
00:21:22.322,00:21:25.409,The Pollock can move.
00:21:27.620,00:21:28.829,Hello?
00:21:28.871,00:21:31.415,Just the Renoir.
00:21:32.917,00:21:34.293,Heavy sigh.
00:21:36.170,00:21:38.631,"Go to work, dreamboat."
00:21:45.972,00:21:48.933,"Now, Mr. Wolff, I half suspect we're wasting your time."
00:21:48.975,00:21:50.601,I'm quite sure you're not.
00:21:50.643,00:21:52.270,And you know this how?
00:21:52.311,00:21:53.938,I'm on the clock.
00:21:54.939,00:21:56.232,Shit.
00:21:56.274,00:21:58.109,I hope we're not wasting ours then.
00:21:59.443,00:22:04.740,"Look, kidding aside, I think if you saw our books, you'd run for the hills."
00:22:04.782,00:22:07.451,We have an incredibly complicated accounting system.
00:22:07.493,00:22:10.079,Depreciation schedules on hundreds of different items.
00:22:10.121,00:22:12.123,Full-time and contract employees.
00:22:12.165,00:22:14.167,Department of Defense classified accounts.
00:22:14.208,00:22:16.043,It's a numerical shitstorm.
00:22:16.085,00:22:18.587,I'll need to see all those books for the past 10 years.
00:22:18.629,00:22:21.423,"Bank statements, complete list of clients and vendors."
00:22:21.465,00:22:23.134,"Hard copies printed out, my eyes only."
00:22:23.176,00:22:24.593,All the information's right here.
00:22:24.635,00:22:26.137,"ED: Okay, well, well, look."
00:22:26.179,00:22:29.015,This all came to my attention only last week.
00:22:29.056,00:22:32.310,"Now, a junior cost accountant stuck her nose where it didn't belong..."
00:22:32.350,00:22:34.436,and obviously had no idea what she was looking at.
00:22:34.478,00:22:36.772,Lamar's overreacting.
00:22:36.814,00:22:39.275,"How long have you been CFO of this company, sir?"
00:22:39.317,00:22:40.693,15 years.
00:22:40.734,00:22:43.112,"I need the books for the past 15, please."
00:22:43.154,00:22:45.281,You're awful goddamn blunt!
00:22:45.323,00:22:47.783,I'm Lamar Blackburn's oldest friend.
00:22:47.825,00:22:52.788,I've been by his side since he was turning out RC robots that RadioShack called crap.
00:22:52.830,00:22:55.166,I wouldn't take a dime without his say-so.
00:22:56.000,00:22:57.210,You're angry.
00:22:57.251,00:22:59.337,"Oh, this is bullshit."
00:22:59.377,00:23:02.340,"Unusual way of making contact with you, Mr. Wolff."
00:23:04.008,00:23:06.135,You were recommended by Mansoor Haqqani.
00:23:06.177,00:23:09.055,We custom-made prosthetics for his youngest daughter.
00:23:09.096,00:23:14.560,You may know that she lost both legs to a car bomb outside his investment firm in Lahore.
00:23:14.601,00:23:18.522,"He told my brother, Lamar, that you were nothing short of supernatural."
00:23:20.107,00:23:24.195,Mr. Haqqani holds advanced degrees in mathematics from Cambridge...
00:23:24.237,00:23:26.739,and Caltech.
00:23:26.780,00:23:30.076,Why does a man like that need you?
00:23:30.117,00:23:32.410,I don't discuss client business.
00:25:03.543,00:25:06.546,What do you suppose that young man is thinking right now?
00:25:07.756,00:25:09.925,Why do I still feel my arm?
00:25:09.967,00:25:11.344,I don't know.
00:25:11.385,00:25:15.513,"How did everything go so wrong, so fast?"
00:25:15.555,00:25:18.225,It's cold.
00:25:20.353,00:25:21.770,"Christian Wolff, I presume."
00:25:21.812,00:25:22.938,Mr. Blackburn.
00:25:22.980,00:25:24.231,Lamar.
00:25:24.690,00:25:25.732,Lamar.
00:25:28.152,00:25:29.320,Come with me.
00:25:31.489,00:25:35.284,Are you aware of Living Robotics' three income streams?
00:25:35.326,00:25:39.497,"Consumer electronics, next generation prosthetics, unmanned military applications."
00:25:39.537,00:25:42.333,Prosthetics division showed tremendous growth over the last 10 years.
00:25:42.375,00:25:44.043,It seems to have matured.
00:25:44.084,00:25:46.379,Consumer products is your highest source of revenue...
00:25:46.420,00:25:50.883,followed closely by Defense Department contracts and prosthetics at two and three.
00:25:50.924,00:25:53.844,You are well informed.
00:25:58.265,00:25:59.557,I never married.
00:25:59.599,00:26:01.185,Never had kids.
00:26:01.227,00:26:03.561,This company is my child.
00:26:03.603,00:26:06.273,"That said, money has never been a motivation."
00:26:06.315,00:26:10.819,"Balance sheets, profit and loss statements..."
00:26:10.861,00:26:14.198,My mind doesn't function the way yours must.
00:26:14.240,00:26:17.201,"I need you to be my eyes and ears, Chris."
00:26:17.243,00:26:21.038,"Whatever you need to do your job, you let me know."
00:26:25.125,00:26:26.877,I'll start in the morning.
00:26:43.394,00:26:45.229,Son of a bitch.
00:26:54.113,00:26:55.322,Bloody hell.
00:26:59.785,00:27:01.287,Excuse me?
00:27:01.328,00:27:03.705,Who the fuck do you think you are?
00:27:03.747,00:27:06.166,Do you know who the fuck I am?
00:27:06.208,00:27:08.544,BRAX: Simon Dewey.
00:27:08.586,00:27:12.172,"Founder, CEO, Dewey Capital."
00:27:12.214,00:27:15.593,American. Shocking.
00:27:15.633,00:27:17.635,I have kidnap insurance.
00:27:17.677,00:27:20.013,"Sorry, but how in the world would I know that you have kid..."
00:27:20.055,00:27:21.599,You people fucking amaze me...
00:27:23.267,00:27:26.312,"When you interrupt somebody like that, it makes them feel..."
00:27:26.353,00:27:29.231,that you're just not interested in what they have to say.
00:27:29.273,00:27:33.235,Or maybe you just think what you have to say is more important than what I have to say.
00:27:33.277,00:27:34.987,Is that what you think?
00:27:37.448,00:27:40.951,"That gun makes you a big man, does it, hmm?"
00:27:42.286,00:27:44.830,"This gun? Simon, come on."
00:27:47.040,00:27:51.295,I'm part of a small but potent department of a private security force.
00:27:51.337,00:27:54.798,"We have a client, let's call it a European manufacturing concern."
00:27:54.840,00:27:57.426,"You're shorting their stock, but simultaneously..."
00:27:57.468,00:28:00.304,you're spreading false rumors regarding the health of the company.
00:28:00.346,00:28:04.141,"The resulting decline in the stock price, it's made you your millions..."
00:28:04.183,00:28:06.059,but it's been at my client's expense.
00:28:06.101,00:28:08.479,"They have been forced to cut hundreds of jobs, Simon."
00:28:08.521,00:28:12.608,"These are third-generation metal workers, people with families."
00:28:12.650,00:28:14.985,Pensions are being rendered worthless because of you.
00:28:15.027,00:28:18.155,But you'll stop now.
00:28:18.989,00:28:20.324,Which company?
00:28:20.366,00:28:21.659,"Wrong answer, Simon."
00:28:21.699,00:28:22.826,"Look, genius..."
00:28:24.370,00:28:25.996,"That's the same spot, Simon."
00:28:26.038,00:28:28.332,Why you gonna let me hit you in the same exact spot?
00:28:28.374,00:28:29.916,I only meant...
00:28:29.958,00:28:31.960,we hold short positions on dozens of companies.
00:28:32.002,00:28:33.629,"Shit, son."
00:28:33.671,00:28:37.715,I suppose you're spreading false information about more than one company.
00:28:37.757,00:28:42.137,"If that's what you're doing, you're just gonna have to stop shorting them all."
00:28:42.179,00:28:43.722,That's ridiculous.
00:28:46.684,00:28:49.978,"Ooh, I know."
00:28:50.020,00:28:53.649,"All right, get your chin up, Simon. No pouting on my watch."
00:28:53.691,00:28:55.317,You're a man. You just...
00:28:55.359,00:28:57.319,You're a man in your own way.
00:29:00.698,00:29:01.699,All right.
00:29:05.035,00:29:07.663,I'm an avid reader of the Journal...
00:29:07.705,00:29:11.500,so I expect the cooperation to be reflected there.
00:29:12.959,00:29:14.503,Simon?
00:29:14.545,00:29:16.255,Are we good?
00:29:16.296,00:29:17.297,Yeah?
00:29:20.133,00:29:22.261,"Attaboy, Simon."
00:30:11.017,00:30:12.144,"Oh, hello."
00:30:12.185,00:30:14.605,"Good morning. Oh, shit."
00:30:14.647,00:30:15.814,Hi.
00:30:15.855,00:30:17.899,Hi.
00:30:17.941,00:30:20.819,I'm Dana Cummings.
00:30:20.860,00:30:23.822,Chris.
00:30:23.863,00:30:25.115,I'm Dana.
00:30:25.157,00:30:26.450,Cummings.
00:30:27.451,00:30:29.411,Yes. Um...
00:30:29.453,00:30:31.664,These are all the files you wanted.
00:30:31.705,00:30:36.168,"I cross-referenced them by year and alphabetically, so..."
00:30:36.209,00:30:37.753,Must have taken you all night.
00:30:40.464,00:30:41.757,Hmm.
00:30:41.799,00:30:42.800,Right.
00:30:43.383,00:30:44.551,So...
00:30:49.055,00:30:50.182,So...
00:30:53.977,00:30:56.689,"What do you want, Dana Cummings?"
00:30:56.730,00:30:59.358,"Oh. Mr. Blackburn, um..."
00:31:00.400,00:31:02.319,"Sorry, he said I should..."
00:31:02.361,00:31:05.280,I'm the person who first noticed the missing...
00:31:05.322,00:31:06.782,What I think was the missing money.
00:31:06.824,00:31:09.201,"Yes, I understand."
00:31:09.242,00:31:13.288,Yeah. I thought we could...
00:31:13.330,00:31:14.790,I brought my own lunch.
00:31:14.832,00:31:16.375,No...
00:31:16.416,00:31:17.835,"I bring my own lunch, too."
00:31:17.876,00:31:20.128,I can answer any questions that you have...
00:31:20.170,00:31:23.131,I have no questions.
00:31:23.173,00:31:27.636,"Yeah, okay. Yeah, you wanna..."
00:31:27.678,00:31:28.887,"Yes, thank you!"
00:31:30.222,00:31:32.974,Okay. Um...
00:31:33.016,00:31:35.644,I'm in accounting if you need anything.
00:31:35.686,00:31:37.312,"There's, uh..."
00:31:37.354,00:31:39.314,some donuts there for you.
00:31:39.356,00:31:41.191,I don't eat donuts.
00:31:42.025,00:31:43.026,Okay.
00:31:50.200,00:31:51.326,REPORTER: Mr. Secretary!
00:31:51.368,00:31:52.578,"TREASURY SECRETARY: Yes, Helen."
00:31:52.619,00:31:54.079,"Sir, there's been speculation..."
00:31:54.120,00:31:59.334,that your ability to link banks in South Florida to money laundering efforts of terrorists...
00:31:59.376,00:32:02.546,are actually the result of a whistleblower or the NSA.
00:32:02.588,00:32:04.214,Care to comment?
00:32:04.256,00:32:06.007,Let me turn this over to the head of my task force...
00:32:06.049,00:32:08.844,"Financial Crimes Director, Raymond King."
00:32:13.891,00:32:17.060,"Folks, there's no great mystery here."
00:32:17.102,00:32:19.855,Nothing fancy.
00:32:19.897,00:32:23.901,comprised of long hours of good old-fashioned investigative work.
00:32:24.568,00:32:25.611,Questions?
00:32:27.529,00:32:30.031,REPORTER: Could you answer the whistleblower question?
00:32:30.073,00:32:31.074,RAY: No.
00:32:33.410,00:32:35.161,"Hey, Sorkis, give me something."
00:32:35.203,00:32:39.082,SORKIS: I matched the face in your Antwerp photo to surveillance video in NYPD database.
00:32:39.124,00:32:43.211,"MARYBETH: Wait, wait, wait."
00:32:43.253,00:32:46.381,2006. Your guy takes out two Mob enforcers...
00:32:46.423,00:32:50.886,with a steak knife he lifted off an Italian restaurant down the street.
00:32:50.928,00:32:55.056,Then he strolls into a den of stone-cold killers and goes on a seven-man killing spree...
00:32:55.098,00:32:56.475,using their own weapons.
00:32:59.102,00:33:00.979,"Headshot, headshot, headshot."
00:33:01.020,00:33:02.522,"MARYBETH: Sorkis, stop."
00:33:02.564,00:33:04.733,A den of stone-cold killers?
00:33:04.775,00:33:07.736,The Ravenite. Headquarters of the Gambino crime family.
00:33:07.778,00:33:10.572,He killed Anthony Little Tony Bazzano.
00:33:10.614,00:33:13.575,Forensics lists cause of death as blunt force trauma.
00:33:13.617,00:33:16.411,Your boy kicked him in the head... once.
00:33:16.453,00:33:19.414,Again. Play it again.
00:33:19.456,00:33:26.797,MOBSTER 1: DON: Wait! I gotta call it in!
00:33:28.548,00:33:30.509,I've also got an audio file here.
00:33:30.550,00:33:32.469,Inside of the Ravenite was bugged.
00:33:33.804,00:33:34.888,LITTLE TONY: Come on.
00:33:36.723,00:33:37.808,Please.
00:33:37.850,00:33:39.643,SORKIS: That's Little Tony.
00:33:39.685,00:33:41.311,LITTLE TONY: I'm fucking begging you.
00:33:41.353,00:33:43.605,I didn't touch him!
00:33:43.647,00:33:45.190,"MARYBETH: Okay, get me that recording ASAP."
00:33:45.231,00:33:50.111,LITTLE TONY: M.B...
00:33:50.153,00:33:52.155,you're an analyst for Treasury.
00:33:53.573,00:33:55.826,What the hell you got yourself into?
00:34:23.186,00:34:25.856,What do you have to hit to dent a steel thermos?
00:34:28.107,00:34:29.526,It's just old.
00:34:34.865,00:34:38.159,"How did you, um, get into financial consulting?"
00:34:38.201,00:34:43.916,statistics indicate it's one of the fastest-growing professions.
00:34:43.957,00:34:46.960,Actuarial sciences are experiencing tremendous growth as well.
00:34:49.421,00:34:50.547,Okay.
00:34:53.383,00:34:54.885,I like the balance of it.
00:34:56.970,00:35:00.724,"You know, I like finding things that aren't obvious."
00:35:02.475,00:35:04.561,"Plus, my dad was an accountant."
00:35:05.562,00:35:06.563,He actually...
00:35:08.732,00:35:11.777,"You know, he had the whole shtick."
00:35:13.152,00:35:16.698,"You know, the little amortization book and the green eyeshade and..."
00:35:16.740,00:35:18.909,the dorky pocket protector and...
00:35:18.951,00:35:20.619,I have a pocket protector.
00:35:23.496,00:35:26.792,"That's a nice one. I mean, his was dorky, that's..."
00:35:26.833,00:35:28.293,Yours is nice.
00:35:30.503,00:35:32.589,"Um, but he convinced me to go into the field."
00:35:32.631,00:35:35.759,Because I wanted to study art at the Art Institute of Chicago...
00:35:35.801,00:35:37.928,pay the mortgage.
00:35:37.970,00:35:40.097,"Art doesn't pay the mortgage, young lady."
00:35:41.932,00:35:44.559,Dad's tastes ran more to Dogs Playing Poker.
00:35:44.601,00:35:47.062,I like Dogs Playing Poker.
00:35:47.104,00:35:49.397,Because dogs would never bet on things...
00:35:49.439,00:35:51.524,and so it's incongruous.
00:35:52.859,00:35:54.945,I like incongruity.
00:35:59.116,00:36:02.786,"Yeah, Dogs Playing Poker is nice. It's just sort of a..."
00:36:03.996,00:36:06.331,Just different.
00:36:06.372,00:36:09.918,"So I studied accounting at the University of Chicago, where fun goes to die."
00:36:09.960,00:36:10.961,Why?
00:36:12.712,00:36:14.339,Why what?
00:36:14.380,00:36:17.884,Why does fun go to die at the University of Chicago?
00:36:17.926,00:36:19.886,"Oh, no, it's just an expression."
00:36:22.681,00:36:23.849,I'm joking.
00:36:28.895,00:36:29.896,Right.
00:36:39.823,00:36:42.450,"Um, I'll leave you to it."
00:36:42.492,00:36:44.911,Let me know if you need anything while you're here.
00:36:47.330,00:36:48.456,Have a nice day.
00:36:48.498,00:36:49.958,"DANA: Yes. You, too."
00:37:12.898,00:37:17.986,"CHRIS: Explain the 376,109..."
00:37:39.674,00:37:41.384,"Accounts receivable, earnings before interest..."

00:38:45.865,00:38:47.492,I'm fucking begging you.
00:38:47.533,00:38:50.369,I didn't touch him!
00:38:59.838,00:39:01.339,Okay.
00:39:03.133,00:39:04.425,Give me something.
00:39:09.555,00:39:13.185,LITTLE TONY: ...fucking begging...
00:39:13.226,00:39:15.895,I didn't touch him!
00:39:26.323,00:39:28.241,"Come on, come on, come on."
00:39:33.288,00:39:34.914,LITTLE TONY: ...begging you.
00:39:34.956,00:39:37.500,I didn't touch him!
00:40:07.072,00:40:34.807,"CHRIS: Born on a Monday Christened on Tuesday Married on Wednesday Solomon Grundy Born on a Monday Christened on Tuesday Married on Wednesday Solomon Grundy Come in! Come in, come in, come in."
00:40:34.849,00:40:36.184,You have to see this.
00:40:36.226,00:40:38.270,It's gonna blow you away.
00:40:38.311,00:40:41.564,"I mean, it'll just jump right out at you."
00:40:43.649,00:40:44.901,There it is.
00:40:44.943,00:40:46.319,Uh-huh.
00:40:46.361,00:40:47.820,"Living Robotics, 10 years ago."

00:40:52.117,00:40:53.701,Nine years ago...
00:40:53.743,00:40:57.122,earnings before tax and depreciation...
00:40:57.163,00:40:59.457,"revenues go up, profits go down."
00:40:59.498,00:41:02.794,Down? No large capital expenditures dragging profits down.
00:41:02.835,00:41:05.297,No spike in raw materials or labor costs.
00:41:05.338,00:41:09.384,"Year eight, profits and revenue both go up, but not in a commensurate fashion."
00:41:09.426,00:41:10.760,X no longer equals Y.
00:41:10.802,00:41:13.763,"Six, five, four, three."
00:41:13.805,00:41:15.265,but there's a leak.
00:41:15.307,00:41:17.350,And the leak is...
00:41:17.392,00:41:19.227,"Leak, where's the leak? Here."
00:41:23.022,00:41:24.941,Slewitt Manufacturing.
00:41:24.983,00:41:26.567,Who authorized it?
00:41:26.609,00:41:29.654,Mr. Chilton. They make electronic assemblies for the consumer division.
00:41:29.695,00:41:31.990,"No, they don't."
00:41:32.991,00:41:34.742,You notice anything?
00:41:36.535,00:41:37.662,Second number in each is a three.
00:41:37.703,00:41:39.289,Yes.
00:41:39.331,00:41:42.959,"Most people, when generating random numbers tend to rely subconsciously on certain..."
00:41:43.001,00:41:44.252,patterns.
00:41:44.294,00:41:45.420,Yes.
00:41:45.462,00:41:46.921,I was right!
00:41:48.173,00:41:50.258,Yeah.
00:41:50.300,00:41:54.429,"I went through these ledgers for months, and I got through one fiscal year."
00:41:54.471,00:41:56.097,You went through 15 overnight?
00:41:56.139,00:41:57.556,That's not even the best part.
00:41:57.598,00:42:01.227,"The best part is, they're routing money to a company that doesn't exist."
00:42:01.269,00:42:04.397,"And yet, profits go up."
00:42:04.439,00:42:05.815,Absolutely makes no sense.
00:42:05.857,00:42:06.983,BOTH: Where's the money coming from?
00:42:07.025,00:42:08.318,Exactly!
00:42:08.360,00:42:09.777,"Um, it's not inventory?"
00:42:09.819,00:42:11.070,Inventory turns. No.
00:42:11.112,00:42:12.155,Chargebacks to vendors?
00:42:12.197,00:42:13.406,No. Perfectly in order.
00:42:13.448,00:42:14.740,Internal offsets?
00:42:14.782,00:42:15.992,No. That's a terrible idea.
00:42:24.459,00:42:27.420,"Cummings, you're needed in..."
00:42:27.462,00:42:29.755,whatever area I'm paying you to be needed in.
00:42:29.797,00:42:30.798,Sorry.
00:42:44.645,00:42:45.646,And?
00:42:54.697,00:42:58.493,"$61,679,000."
00:42:59.369,00:43:00.661,And some change.
00:43:01.662,00:43:03.915,Who did it? Best guess.
00:43:03.956,00:43:05.542,I don't guess.
00:43:07.419,00:43:09.962,You'll have a report for me?
00:43:10.004,00:43:11.839,"When I'm finished, yes."
00:43:45.498,00:43:48.042,"BRAX: Hey, Ed."
00:43:48.084,00:43:50.044,We're having lemon merengue pie.
00:43:50.086,00:43:52.130,Those two bottles of insulin.
00:43:54.715,00:43:57.676,"You know, I just thought..."
00:43:57.718,00:44:01.222,"that you would appreciate me treating you like an adult, right?"
00:44:01.264,00:44:02.974,So here's what I got.
00:44:08.271,00:44:13.234,"You administer your own accidental insulin overdose, and just..."
00:44:14.360,00:44:15.570,die.
00:44:15.612,00:44:17.238,But do it with dignity.
00:44:17.280,00:44:22.076,"Your wife, who's sleeping upstairs, she'll be the beneficiary..."
00:44:22.118,00:44:26.205,"of what's gotta be a very generous insurance policy, am I right?"
00:44:26.247,00:44:28.374,"But the only way she's gonna collect on that policy, Ed..."
00:44:28.416,00:44:31.419,is if we have the appearance of an accident.
00:44:31.461,00:44:35.381,"If we lay our hands on you, you're gonna fight, squeal."
00:44:35.423,00:44:37.216,"She wakes up, my hands are tied."
00:44:37.258,00:44:39.469,"One accidental death is just that, but two, no."
00:44:39.511,00:44:41.554,I'll have no choice.
00:44:41.596,00:44:44.682,I'll have to rock and roll a home invasion...
00:44:44.723,00:44:46.476,violate your wife a dozen different ways...
00:44:46.518,00:44:48.769,"kill you both, burn the place to the ground."
00:44:50.938,00:44:53.483,I'm sorry for that.
00:44:53.525,00:44:57.445,"Hey, nobody's gonna violate your wife, okay?"
00:44:57.487,00:45:01.533,Aside from what that would say about me as a human being...
00:45:01.574,00:45:03.742,physiologically it's a non-starter.
00:45:03.784,00:45:09.332,"Sometimes I think I just say shit, sample what comes out of my mouth."
00:45:09.374,00:45:11.876,"I will, however, park a .45 in her brainpan."
00:45:13.670,00:45:15.838,I honor my commitments.
00:45:15.880,00:45:20.926,It's a concept you and your sticky fingers probably find hard to grasp.
00:45:25.515,00:45:27.350,"Make a decision, sir."
00:45:38.903,00:45:41.197,Where are you going?
00:45:41.947,00:45:42.948,Sir?
00:45:45.159,00:45:47.245,Stop that. Why are you doing that? Stop that.
00:45:47.286,00:45:50.248,Sir? Sir? What are you doing?
00:45:50.289,00:45:52.417,Mr. Chilton passed away.
00:45:52.458,00:45:54.460,I was told to clean up the room.
00:45:55.503,00:45:56.671,What's happening?
00:45:59.006,00:46:00.883,"Can you give us a minute, please?"
00:46:04.011,00:46:05.722,This is the balance of your contract.
00:46:05.762,00:46:07.682,I understand you're upset...
00:46:07.724,00:46:08.849,I haven't finished yet.
00:46:08.891,00:46:10.767,"Yes, you have."
00:46:10.809,00:46:12.478,Ed was a diabetic for 30 years.
00:46:12.520,00:46:15.064,You think he didn't know how to check his blood sugar?
00:46:15.106,00:46:18.150,Whatever unresolved issues remain...
00:46:18.192,00:46:22.447,my friend was poisoned enough by them to take his own life.
00:46:22.488,00:46:25.116,"As far as I'm concerned, whatever he did is forgiven."
00:46:25.157,00:46:27.285,"Please. I need to finish, please."
00:46:27.326,00:46:29.579,"Sorry, I'll come back."
00:46:30.705,00:46:31.914,We're done.
00:46:33.916,00:46:36.168,"You're very good, Mr. Wolff."
00:46:36.210,00:46:39.464,But I hope our paths never cross again.
00:46:39.505,00:46:43.134,I'm responsible for the death of my best friend.
00:46:43.175,00:46:45.844,I'd prefer not to be reminded of it.
00:46:57.356,00:47:00.151,Do you think that's true?
00:47:00.192,00:47:02.819,That Mr. Chilton killed himself...
00:47:02.861,00:47:05.448,"I mean, do you think we're responsible?"
00:47:05.490,00:47:08.326,It's very hard for me to interpret why people do what they do.
00:47:13.038,00:47:15.458,I'm not finished.
00:47:16.875,00:47:19.044,"I mean, look..."
00:47:20.546,00:47:22.965,"See, cost reports."
00:47:23.007,00:47:26.469,They completely rearranged this.
00:47:26.511,00:47:28.680,I'm not finished.
00:47:33.850,00:47:35.060,"Bye, Chris."

00:50:45.543,00:50:47.127,They're not done.
00:50:47.169,00:50:51.215,Tomorrow is another day.
00:50:51.256,00:50:54.886,"If that were true, you'd be covered in blood and snot, not them."
00:50:56.012,00:50:57.346,Keep going.
00:51:09.859,00:51:13.821,"Aggression, correctly channeled, overcomes a lot of flaws."
00:51:15.823,00:51:18.951,Tapping into that aggression requires...
00:51:18.993,00:51:22.997,peeling back several layers of yourself.
00:51:23.039,00:51:25.833,It's my job to know my sons' limitations.
00:51:27.668,00:51:28.878,Get up.
00:51:30.838,00:51:32.548,It's your job to peel.
00:51:32.590,00:51:34.633,Do your job.

00:52:04.914,00:52:06.749,And we'd be on a plane by now.
00:52:06.791,00:52:10.126,"Or on a security camera, or some nosy neighbor's iPhone."
00:52:14.130,00:52:15.507,Call the bookkeeper in.
00:52:17.093,00:52:18.510,He won't hear.
00:52:18.552,00:52:20.721,Now.
00:52:20.763,00:52:22.556,Get up. Come on.
00:52:25.350,00:52:26.393,Move!
00:52:28.687,00:52:29.981,"Come on, come on, come on."
00:52:41.157,00:52:42.158,Chris!
00:52:46.330,00:52:49.249,Again! Louder!
00:52:52.168,00:52:53.169,Up! Up!
00:52:58.676,00:53:00.385,"No, no! Please!"
00:53:00.427,00:53:01.553,Dolores!
00:53:04.473,00:53:05.641,She's coming with me.
00:53:05.683,00:53:07.183,"No, no, stop!"
00:53:13.107,00:53:15.693,We're all going together.
00:53:15.734,00:53:17.444,Let's go! Let's go!
00:53:21.115,00:53:22.240,Let's move!
00:53:23.826,00:53:26.037,Come on! Drive!
00:53:36.463,00:53:38.298,Jesus fucking Christ!
00:53:42.970,00:53:44.138,God damn it!
00:53:47.683,00:53:48.934,Son of a bitch!
00:54:28.140,00:54:29.391,What the fuck?
00:54:42.780,00:54:45.866,"When I say the name of your employer, you say yes."
00:54:45.908,00:54:47.826,Practice.
00:54:47.868,00:54:48.869,Yes.
00:54:49.912,00:54:50.913,Camorra.
00:54:51.580,00:54:52.998,Juarez.
00:54:53.040,00:54:54.041,Gambino.
00:54:55.126,00:54:56.460,Do you understand the rules?
00:55:02.674,00:55:04.009,Kill you both.
00:55:04.051,00:55:05.219,That's all I know.

00:55:46.551,00:55:48.428,Boole. Obviously.
00:55:48.470,00:55:50.097,Silly of me. What else?
00:55:52.016,00:55:53.684,She is not your problem.
00:55:53.725,00:55:56.103,"Straight to the trailer, hook it up, and disappear."
00:55:56.145,00:55:57.521,There's no time.
00:55:57.562,00:56:00.107,Only the trailer.
00:56:00.149,00:56:02.609,Address and phone number.
00:56:33.891,00:56:35.142,She's not answering.
00:58:06.900,00:58:08.319,Could have used the small box.
00:58:08.360,00:58:10.237,"Well, she looked bigger in the photo."
00:58:13.865,00:58:14.866,God!
00:58:51.569,00:58:53.530,God damn!
00:58:53.571,00:58:54.572,Bitch!
00:58:57.451,00:58:58.494,Fuck.
00:59:31.902,00:59:33.487,We should go.
00:59:38.992,00:59:41.870,BRAX: Since when are accountants difficult to ventilate?
00:59:44.748,00:59:47.876,"Christ! What'd he do, hit him over the head with an adding machine?"
00:59:52.172,00:59:53.382,"Oh, God."
00:59:56.051,00:59:59.804,"All right, just put me in touch with the client."
00:59:59.846,01:00:02.224,I'll handle this accountant myself.
01:00:05.310,01:00:06.520,Running isn't an option for me.
01:00:06.562,01:00:08.021,I can't just walk out on my life!
01:00:08.063,01:00:09.523,We have to go to the police.
01:00:09.565,01:00:11.525,"That's what normal, taxpaying people do!"
01:00:11.567,01:00:15.779,Police can't protect you from someone who can afford to return $61 million.
01:00:15.820,01:00:17.531,"Return? What are you talking about, return?"
01:00:17.573,01:00:19.450,The money was being put back.
01:00:19.491,01:00:20.658,Stay here.
01:01:22.262,01:01:23.388,What are you doing in here?
01:01:23.430,01:01:24.722,Who are you?
01:01:24.764,01:01:26.016,You should not be here.
01:01:26.057,01:01:27.976,Sit down. Sit right there.
01:01:31.813,01:01:33.231,What is this place?
01:01:34.608,01:01:37.194,"PanAmerica, Airstream."
01:01:37.235,01:01:40.238,34 feet 7 inches long...
01:01:40.280,01:01:42.782,8 feet 5 inches wide.
01:01:42.824,01:01:45.952,Dimensions which are perfectly adequate for one person.
01:01:45.994,01:01:47.454,"Preferable, even."
01:01:48.497,01:01:50.081,This is where you live?
01:01:50.123,01:01:53.084,"No, I don't live here."
01:01:53.126,01:01:54.252,That would be weird.
01:01:54.294,01:01:55.795,That's what would be weird?
01:01:55.837,01:01:58.382,I'd like to spend more time here.
01:01:58.423,01:02:02.052,"However, I'm afraid some of my clients might follow me."
01:02:02.093,01:02:03.303,Why would your clients follow you?
01:02:03.345,01:02:05.305,You're an accountant!
01:02:05.347,01:02:06.640,How do you know what to do here?
01:02:06.682,01:02:08.308,Why are you prepared for this?
01:02:08.350,01:02:10.018,"Plus, this is on wheels..."
01:02:10.060,01:02:12.563,which means I can hook it up and be gone in 12 minutes.
01:02:12.604,01:02:13.730,Usually.
01:02:13.771,01:02:16.316,Sarcasm? Is that sarcasm?
01:02:16.358,01:02:17.651,"No, that's not sarcasm."
01:02:17.693,01:02:19.570,I don't use sarcasm.
01:02:19.611,01:02:22.155,Everything in the world that is important to me is in this trailer.
01:02:22.197,01:02:24.491,"And right now, changing my routine for you is jeopardizing that."
01:02:29.621,01:02:31.707,Tell me that's not an original Pollock.
01:02:36.794,01:02:37.962,We should go.
01:02:40.215,01:02:41.299,Now.
01:02:57.399,01:02:59.276,Medina.
01:02:59.317,01:03:02.195,This is Gordon Amundson with the FBI Language Services.
01:03:02.237,01:03:04.155,"Uh, yeah. Any luck?"
01:03:04.197,01:03:06.450,It's an unusual audio file.
01:03:06.491,01:03:10.203,Solomon Grundy is a nursery rhyme circa mid-1800s.
01:03:10.245,01:03:14.708,Your voice has four of the six intonation patterns we use to define American English.
01:03:14.750,01:03:17.711,That's difficult to confirm with a rhyme.
01:03:17.753,01:03:21.131,"Out of curiosity, was your subject a trauma victim?"
01:03:21.172,01:03:23.133,"Um, why do you ask that?"
01:03:23.174,01:03:25.636,"Well, you indicated on your submission..."
01:03:25.677,01:03:28.513,that this event occurred in a high-stress environment?
01:03:28.555,01:03:30.557,Yeah. Exceptionally.
01:03:30.599,01:03:32.183,That's interesting.
01:03:32.225,01:03:35.853,The verse was repeated a total of four and a half times...
01:03:35.895,01:03:42.193,"with zero variation in pitch, span, tempo, volume or articulatory precision."
01:03:42.235,01:03:44.070,So what does that mean exactly?
01:03:44.112,01:03:46.490,"Well, we often see this type of repetitive chanting..."
01:03:46.531,01:03:48.992,in children who have been exposed to trauma...
01:03:49.033,01:03:51.536,or persons with neurodevelopmental disorders.
01:03:51.578,01:03:53.538,Neurodevelopmental disorders?
01:03:53.580,01:03:55.791,"Fragile X syndrome, autism."
01:03:56.541,01:03:58.084,"Okay, so..."
01:03:58.126,01:03:59.919,let's say I was looking at mugshots.
01:03:59.961,01:04:01.588,How would that present itself?
01:04:01.630,01:04:03.590,What exactly would I be looking for?
01:04:03.632,01:04:08.679,"Fragile X... Elongated face, protruding ears, poor muscle tone."
01:04:08.720,01:04:11.556,Autism's nearly impossible to identify visually.
01:04:11.598,01:04:13.308,The traits are behavioral...
01:04:13.350,01:04:16.269,"Difficulty with social interaction, communication..."
01:04:16.311,01:04:18.605,lack of eye contact.
01:04:18.647,01:04:21.608,MARYBETH: Lack of eye contact.
01:04:23.318,01:04:24.444,Good luck to you.
01:04:24.486,01:04:25.487,Thanks.
01:05:16.496,01:05:18.164,DANA: None of this makes sense.
01:05:18.206,01:05:21.501,Why go through the trouble of skimming the money if you're gonna put it back?
01:05:21.543,01:05:22.836,CHRIS: Over the last two years...
01:05:22.878,01:05:27.298,the number of invoices submitted by Slewitt Manufacturing declined.
01:05:27.340,01:05:28.675,DANA: Scared of getting caught?
01:05:30.552,01:05:32.053,Price hikes?
01:05:32.095,01:05:34.138,"Prices of consumer electronics go down, not up."
01:05:34.180,01:05:36.558,"Right, down, yeah. Um..."
01:05:38.226,01:05:39.644,I can't afford this.
01:05:39.686,01:05:41.312,I know. My treat.
01:05:44.148,01:05:47.110,"IRS AGENT: In the US, 104 men..."

01:06:00.373,01:06:01.666,IRS AGENT: 17.
01:06:01.708,01:06:05.253,"MARYBETH: Of the 17, how many between the ages of 25 and 45?"
01:06:06.003,01:06:07.464,IRS AGENT: Four.
01:06:07.505,01:06:08.673,Of those four...
01:06:08.715,01:06:12.636,only one has an income stream that's cash heavy or easily laundered.
01:06:12.677,01:06:13.845,And he...
01:06:15.179,01:06:16.431,died three years ago.
01:06:23.814,01:06:25.231,What's this?
01:06:25.273,01:06:27.525,It's names of the 100 most famous mathematicians.
01:06:29.444,01:06:30.821,"Look, we know what we're doing now."
01:06:30.862,01:06:34.324,"So just enter the names, narrow down the search right off the bat."
01:06:34.365,01:06:35.992,"Male, Caucasian..."
01:06:36.033,01:06:38.745,"25 to 45, earning a million plus."
01:06:38.787,01:06:41.915,No investment income.
01:06:43.124,01:06:44.417,What's in it for me?
01:06:45.961,01:06:49.881,"Look, if you help me find him, I'll see what I can do about getting you outta here."
01:06:52.258,01:06:53.301,Please.
01:06:54.761,01:06:56.554,Single earner or filing jointly?
01:07:16.992,01:07:19.118,"Hey, those paintings in your trailer..."
01:07:19.160,01:07:20.286,"They're real, right?"
01:07:20.328,01:07:21.913,Yes.
01:07:21.955,01:07:24.040,"You didn't buy them at auction, did you?"
01:07:24.081,01:07:25.792,They're a form of payment.
01:07:26.668,01:07:27.836,Right.
01:07:29.086,01:07:30.630,Hey.
01:07:30.672,01:07:32.007,Thank you.
01:07:35.426,01:07:36.761,At my apartment.
01:07:36.803,01:07:37.804,Oh.
01:07:38.847,01:07:39.931,Yeah.
01:07:42.809,01:07:44.477,Can we sit down for a second?
01:07:46.103,01:07:48.314,Yeah. Okay.
01:07:56.698,01:07:57.699,Just...
01:08:01.202,01:08:02.328,Sit.
01:08:17.510,01:08:19.721,"How do you, um..."
01:08:20.722,01:08:21.723,know...
01:08:22.891,01:08:24.017,how to...
01:08:25.226,01:08:27.186,My father was an officer in the Army.
01:08:27.228,01:08:29.480,Psychological Operations.
01:08:29.522,01:08:33.317,He was concerned that I might be taken advantage of somehow...
01:08:33.359,01:08:39.699,so he arranged for me to train with a number of specialists throughout my childhood.
01:08:39.741,01:08:43.369,We lived in 34 homes in 17 years.
01:08:43.411,01:08:45.329,You moved 34 times?
01:08:46.873,01:08:48.583,God. That's extraordinary.
01:08:51.335,01:08:54.338,"No, I'm sure it must've been difficult but..."
01:08:54.380,01:08:55.924,I haven't been anywhere.
01:08:57.926,01:09:01.096,"Well, Cancun."
01:09:01.930,01:09:02.931,Um...
01:09:04.724,01:09:06.059,I just mean...
01:09:08.436,01:09:11.022,your life is... unique.
01:09:11.064,01:09:12.523,It's not unique.
01:09:12.565,01:09:16.235,I have a high-functioning form of autism...
01:09:16.277,01:09:17.988,which means I have an extremely narrow focus...
01:09:18.029,01:09:21.198,and a hard time abandoning tasks once I've taken them up.
01:09:21.240,01:09:25.453,"I have difficulty socializing with other people, even though..."
01:09:26.871,01:09:28.205,I want to.
01:09:34.587,01:09:39.216,"When I was a senior in high school, I wanted this special dress for prom."
01:09:39.258,01:09:42.720,I told myself that spending $100 on a trashy dress that I was gonna wear one time...
01:09:42.762,01:09:44.931,"to an event that I thought was silly in the first place, was..."
01:09:44.973,01:09:46.099,Wasteful.
01:09:46.141,01:09:47.725,Yes.
01:09:47.767,01:09:52.105,"But Vera Wang made this black, strapless classic."
01:09:52.147,01:09:54.983,"It was more expensive, but you could wear it to all kinds of future events."
01:09:55.025,01:09:56.776,It was an investment.
01:09:56.818,01:09:58.862,Where were you when I was in high school?
01:09:58.903,01:10:01.114,"Oh, North Carolina, Israel."
01:10:02.949,01:10:05.035,Right. Um...
01:10:05.076,01:10:08.621,"The problem was they wanted $1700 for this dress and I didn't have that, so..."
01:10:08.663,01:10:10.165,You asked your parents?
01:10:10.832,01:10:12.000,Hang on.
01:10:13.835,01:10:16.713,Blackjack. I'd never played a hand...
01:10:16.754,01:10:19.382,but I went to the library and I checked out all these books on strategy.
01:10:19.423,01:10:21.968,And I turned the Naperville North math club into a little Vegas.
01:10:22.010,01:10:25.138,What's a math club?
01:10:25.180,01:10:26.973,You compete against other schools.
01:10:27.015,01:10:29.809,Theory and speed math.
01:10:29.851,01:10:34.814,"Like, what's 298,567 times 92?"
01:10:34.856,01:10:39.652,"27,468,164."
01:10:43.865,01:10:45.158,Right. Um...
01:10:46.492,01:10:48.285,Blackjack.
01:10:48.327,01:10:51.581,"I could tell you when to hit, stand, split, re-split."
01:10:51.622,01:10:55.001,"I moved on to card counting, shuffle tracking, hole carding."
01:10:55.043,01:10:58.838,"And I took everything I had, which was $183..."
01:10:58.880,01:11:01.799,and I drove down to Harrah's in Joliet.
01:11:01.841,01:11:03.342,Why was this dress so important to you?
01:11:03.384,01:11:05.220,It wasn't about the dress.
01:11:07.304,01:11:11.809,I just wanted to walk into the gym and have everybody say Wow!
01:11:13.561,01:11:17.356,I was trying to... belong.
01:11:17.398,01:11:19.316,I was trying to connect.
01:11:22.153,01:11:25.031,"I think no matter how different we are, we're all trying to do the same thing."
01:11:29.410,01:11:35.208,"Um, but I lost all but $20 in the first 10 minutes."
01:11:35.250,01:11:37.877,I fed that into a nickel slot on the way out...
01:11:37.919,01:11:40.046,and I won two grand.
01:11:40.088,01:11:42.381,I used the extra cash to pay for a limo.
01:11:44.508,01:11:46.844,Only wore the dress the one time.
01:11:59.065,01:12:01.276,"Chris, why are we here?"
01:12:02.277,01:12:03.278,Um...
01:12:04.862,01:12:07.698,I thought this hotel had good water pressure.
01:12:07.740,01:12:10.868,The Holiday Inn Express in Aurora has good water pressure.
01:12:10.910,01:12:13.621,"Yes, but, uh, these towels are very fancy."
01:12:14.956,01:12:17.625,Cheaper hotels have scratchy towels.
01:12:19.127,01:12:20.461,And...
01:12:21.629,01:12:23.047,I wanted you to like it.
01:12:40.648,01:12:43.693,Crazy Eddie and the Panama Pump.
01:12:43.734,01:12:45.278,Crazy Eddie Antar and the Panama Pump.
01:12:45.320,01:12:46.612,Have you ever heard of...
01:12:46.654,01:12:48.031,What?
01:12:48.072,01:12:49.240,Crazy Eddie Antar.
01:12:49.282,01:12:53.452,He owned a string of electronic stores in New York City in the 80s.
01:12:53.494,01:12:56.956,"Crazy Eddie Antar, he started stealing almost as soon as he opened business."
01:12:56.998,01:12:58.291,"Okay, I'm not following."
01:12:58.333,01:13:00.126,He deposited money in Tel Aviv...
01:13:00.168,01:13:03.254,and then he cycled it through Panama and put it back into his stores.
01:13:03.296,01:13:04.797,Okay. Why take it out and put it back?
01:13:04.839,01:13:08.092,"Well, initially he was just stealing in garden-variety tax evasion..."
01:13:08.134,01:13:10.427,but then he came up with a better idea.
01:13:10.469,01:13:15.141,"You see, by taking his own money, stealing it, and putting it back on his books..."
01:13:15.183,01:13:16.726,He was raining cash.
01:13:16.767,01:13:18.811,He took the company public at $8 a share.
01:13:18.853,01:13:21.522,"A year later, it was trading at $75."
01:13:23.149,01:13:25.484,Rita's taking Living Robotics public.
01:13:25.526,01:13:27.028,Yes.
01:13:27.070,01:13:30.698,But why would she hire you in the first place if she thought you would figure it out?
01:13:31.991,01:13:33.034,I don't know.
01:13:34.660,01:13:36.037,I'll have to ask her.
01:13:39.040,01:13:43.294,"WOMAN: Whatever Rita's involvement, it's not your concern."
01:13:43.336,01:13:45.504,"You disappear, I make a call."
01:13:45.546,01:13:47.506,Please. I worry about you.
01:13:47.548,01:13:50.134,"If I don't do something, Dana will die."
01:13:50.176,01:13:52.636,Risking your life for a girl you've known a week.
01:13:52.678,01:13:53.679,Why?
01:13:56.224,01:13:57.683,Heavy sigh.
01:13:57.725,01:13:59.352,What's the plan?
01:13:59.394,01:14:01.771,Find the person who wants to kill her.
01:14:01.812,01:14:03.522,And?
01:14:03.564,01:14:05.149,Shoot them in the head.
01:16:19.033,01:16:20.410,Last one.
01:16:20.451,01:16:24.121,"Wolff, two Fs, Christian."
01:16:25.789,01:16:27.833,245 men.
01:16:29.502,01:16:31.712,Four with incomes over a million.
01:16:33.964,01:16:36.759,All over the age of 60. Sorry.
01:16:36.800,01:16:41.013,Your guy's an accountant.
01:16:41.055,01:16:44.350,Two Christian Wolffs own CPA firms.
01:16:44.392,01:16:47.186,The first Christian Wolff owns...

01:16:53.317,01:16:57.988,Income of 435 grand.
01:16:58.030,01:17:01.158,"So good, we audited him two years ago."
01:17:01.200,01:17:02.535,He's clean.
01:17:02.577,01:17:04.495,The other Christian Wolff...
01:17:06.247,01:17:07.957,Nope.
01:17:07.998,01:17:09.584,Only 75 grand.
01:17:11.668,01:17:15.047,ZZZ Accounting.

01:17:20.386,01:17:23.556,"I mean, it's not exactly a smart Yellow Pages move."
01:17:27.768,01:17:28.936,Wait a second.
01:17:31.188,01:17:35.568,"Who filed the returns for Kim's Nails, Wabash Way, Plainfield?"
01:17:38.571,01:17:41.740,ZZZ Accounting. Could just be the neighborly...

01:17:56.213,01:17:58.549,Tell me they're all registered as partnerships.
01:18:01.302,01:18:02.345,Every one.
01:18:02.386,01:18:04.096,Managing partner...
01:18:04.138,01:18:05.389,Christian Wolff.
01:18:14.649,01:18:16.900,Christian Wolff.
01:18:16.942,01:18:20.112,"Christian Wolff last year ran $75,543..."
01:18:20.154,01:18:21.447,through his accounting firm.
01:18:21.489,01:18:22.615,Whoa. Who is Christian Wolff?
01:18:22.657,01:18:24.158,The accountant.
01:18:27.036,01:18:28.996,75 grand?
01:18:29.038,01:18:34.835,"But he ran another $287,765 through Kim's Nails..."
01:18:34.877,01:18:39.632,"$445,112 through Great Mandarin Chinese, and you'll love this..."
01:18:39.674,01:18:44.970,"$505,909 through Paul's Laundromat."
01:18:45.012,01:18:48.098,Paul's Laundromat?
01:18:48.140,01:18:49.350,He's playing with us.
01:18:49.392,01:18:51.644,He can't clean that kind of money through an accounting firm.
01:18:51.686,01:18:53.312,The paper trail's too heavy.
01:18:53.354,01:18:55.105,So he's laundering it through cash businesses.
01:18:55.147,01:18:58.150,All of those are in the same strip mall south of Chicago.
01:18:58.192,01:18:59.443,ZZZ?
01:18:59.485,01:19:00.986,"I mean, he doesn't care about the traffic."
01:19:01.028,01:19:02.613,It's a front. All of it.
01:19:02.655,01:19:06.116,"Christian Wolff, Carl Gauss, Lou Lewis Carroll."
01:19:06.158,01:19:09.495,He's using the names of famous mathematicians as a cover.
01:19:12.415,01:19:16.168,Charitable contributions here to Harbor Neuroscience.
01:19:16.210,01:19:18.462,"Last year alone, that's gotta come to close to..."
01:19:18.504,01:19:20.047,"$1,000,100."
01:19:20.089,01:19:21.465,That one's not a cover.
01:19:21.507,01:19:23.800,That's the real deal.
01:19:23.842,01:19:25.720,So you're telling me this guy risks his life...
01:19:25.761,01:19:29.640,doing forensic accounting for some of the scariest people on the planet...
01:19:29.682,01:19:32.602,"collects his fee, goes to all the trouble of laundering it..."
01:19:32.643,01:19:34.061,and then gives almost all of it away?
01:19:35.896,01:19:38.691,What if he's taking other means of payment?
01:19:41.110,01:19:42.737,"Yeah, possible. Yeah."
01:19:44.572,01:19:46.031,"I caught him, Ray."
01:19:46.782,01:19:48.200,Maybe.
01:19:48.242,01:19:50.202,Pack a bag.
01:21:03.192,01:21:06.487,CHRIS' FATHER: 90% probability they're all right-handed.
01:21:09.657,01:21:11.575,"Up to me, I'd snap four right wrists."
01:21:11.617,01:21:15.120,But maybe you enjoy waiting on a schoolyard sucker punch.
01:21:17.206,01:21:20.543,"Life is a series of choices, none of which are new."
01:21:22.336,01:21:26.465,The oldest is choosing to be a victim.
01:21:26.507,01:21:28.217,Or choosing not to.
01:21:29.719,01:21:32.429,Second oldest... Loyalty.
01:21:32.471,01:21:35.808,"Family first, good times or bad."
01:21:41.856,01:21:43.858,"Bonjour, fellas."
01:21:47.361,01:21:49.238,They're only glasses.
01:21:51.365,01:21:56.995,You think if you don't fight back then maybe they'll like you.
01:21:57.037,01:22:00.457,"Stop picking on you, calling you freak."
01:22:00.499,01:22:02.209,"Well, here's what it is."
01:22:02.251,01:22:05.880,"They don't like you, they don't dislike you."
01:22:05.921,01:22:07.798,They're afraid of you.
01:22:07.840,01:22:10.342,You're different.
01:22:10.384,01:22:13.554,"Sooner or later, different scares people."
01:22:17.516,01:22:21.103,Victim or not?
01:22:55.387,01:22:56.430,Go.
01:23:11.069,01:23:12.571,CHRIS'S FATHER: You're different.
01:23:16.992,01:23:19.495,"Sooner or later, different scares people."
01:24:25.185,01:24:26.520,FBI AGENT: In here.
01:24:37.740,01:24:40.492,.357 Colt Python.

01:24:57.051,01:24:58.677,Wireless security cam.
01:24:59.887,01:25:02.514,"Infrared, weatherproof."
01:25:02.556,01:25:04.391,He's got a network of 'em.
01:25:04.433,01:25:06.602,Whole back yard's got eyes.
01:25:13.734,01:25:15.069,This is our guy.
01:25:15.151,01:25:18.363,So why does a guy who's up to his elbows in cash live here?
01:25:18.405,01:25:23.368,"Given his clientele, he figures blending in will extend his shelf life."
01:25:23.410,01:25:24.954,It's the smart move.
01:25:26.538,01:25:29.541,"Well, maybe not smart enough."
01:25:29.583,01:25:32.086,High-tech security cameras back here...
01:25:33.545,01:25:36.048,anybody could roll up in the front.
01:25:36.090,01:25:38.050,How does he cover this?
01:25:41.971,01:25:44.222,"Jesus, Mary and Joseph."
01:25:51.939,01:25:53.607,Don't see that every day.
01:25:55.776,01:25:58.487,"BRAX: Boys, let's have a situation report."
01:25:59.488,01:26:00.906,"We good, Ike?"
01:26:00.948,01:26:02.449,All clear.
01:26:02.491,01:26:03.951,BRAX: Rock and roll.
01:26:03.993,01:26:06.078,"And how about you, sport?"
01:26:06.120,01:26:07.621,It's Bobby.
01:26:08.580,01:26:09.957,I got nothing.
01:26:13.293,01:26:16.088,"MAN: Okay, yeah, I'm getting a feed on the camera now."
01:26:16.130,01:26:17.464,Move it to the left side.
01:26:20.050,01:26:22.094,LAMAR: Is all this really necessary?
01:26:22.136,01:26:23.637,You should be watching his home.
01:26:23.679,01:26:25.097,Yeah? What you think?
01:26:25.139,01:26:27.099,That's your idea on the subject?
01:26:27.141,01:26:29.935,Love it when people tell me how to do my job.
01:26:29.977,01:26:31.937,I believe I recommended you leave the country.
01:26:31.979,01:26:33.105,You declined.
01:26:33.147,01:26:35.107,He's an accountant!
01:26:35.149,01:26:36.608,I could see it in his eyes.
01:26:36.650,01:26:38.694,The freak wasn't gonna let it go.
01:26:42.614,01:26:43.907,My best to Michelle.
01:26:43.949,01:26:44.992,I will.
01:27:02.009,01:27:04.636,I was old 10 years ago.
01:27:07.806,01:27:09.808,"So what's your story, Medina?"
01:27:11.185,01:27:12.602,You know my story.
01:27:12.644,01:27:15.022,I know what the courts said.
01:27:17.733,01:27:21.653,Stuffed a handful of cocaine up a drug dealer's nose...
01:27:21.695,01:27:24.156,pistol-whipped him into the trunk of his car.
01:27:25.490,01:27:29.327,I was 17.
01:27:29.369,01:27:33.165,"He cooked for three days, but lived."
01:27:33.207,01:27:34.666,Do you regret it?
01:27:34.708,01:27:37.627,The coke was half borax.
01:27:37.669,01:27:41.006,Same shit he kept selling my sister.
01:27:41.048,01:27:44.134,She's a dental hygienist in Annapolis now.
01:27:44.176,01:27:46.178,"Married, three kids."
01:27:50.015,01:27:51.433,"No, I don't regret it."
01:27:52.726,01:27:55.478,That's rough.
01:27:55.520,01:27:57.689,"All due respect, Director King..."
01:27:57.731,01:28:00.234,what the fuck do you know about rough?
01:28:04.988,01:28:07.032,DON: Wait!
01:28:07.074,01:28:08.200,RAY: Move it!
01:28:08.242,01:28:09.910,"RAY: You tell me, Medina."
01:28:15.415,01:28:18.418,Men kill each other for any number of reasons.
01:28:18.460,01:28:20.045,"MOBSTER: Bobby, you hear me?"
01:28:20.087,01:28:22.839,"RAY: Money, power..."
01:28:22.881,01:28:24.340,fear.
01:28:24.382,01:28:25.550,"MOBSTER: Right there, motherfucker!"
01:28:28.804,01:28:32.766,RAY: Nine men would die that day at the Ravenite...
01:28:32.808,01:28:34.601,but for none of those reasons.
01:28:37.437,01:28:42.442,"No, they'd taken something from the man who was killing them."
01:28:42.484,01:28:45.112,Something that couldn't be made whole again.
01:28:46.738,01:28:48.907,Something very important to him.
01:28:50.617,01:28:52.911,And he was there for his pound of flesh.
01:28:52.953,01:28:54.579,LITTLE TONY: Please!
01:28:54.621,01:28:56.206,"Just fucking stop, man!"
01:28:56.248,01:28:57.791,Just put the gun down!
01:28:59.459,01:29:02.420,RAY: Little Tony Bazzano.
01:29:02.462,01:29:04.798,I'd been wedged in a van for six months...
01:29:04.840,01:29:08.135,"listening to that arrogant little prick belch, fart, and brag."
01:29:08.177,01:29:09.552,LITTLE TONY: Please.
01:29:09.594,01:29:11.554,I'm fucking begging you.
01:29:11.596,01:29:14.099,RAY: I didn't recognize his voice with all the fear in it.
01:29:14.141,01:29:17.060,LITTLE TONY: I didn't touch him!
01:29:23.358,01:29:24.985,RAY: Our man had come for revenge.
01:29:26.320,01:29:27.779,And he got it.
01:29:28.822,01:29:30.282,Nine dead.
01:29:32.993,01:29:34.494,And I was 10.
01:29:36.872,01:29:39.166,Your name?
01:29:40.667,01:29:41.877,Ray.
01:29:43.170,01:29:44.838,Raymond King.
01:29:44.880,01:29:47.132,"Who employs you, Raymond King?"
01:29:49.009,01:29:50.677,I'm a Treasury agent.
01:29:52.346,01:29:54.014,Are you a good one?
01:29:56.474,01:29:57.684,No.
01:29:57.726,01:29:59.311,"No, not particularly."
01:30:01.521,01:30:02.731,Is that it?
01:30:05.067,01:30:06.943,"Kids, I got... I'm a dad."
01:30:06.985,01:30:08.528,I got two kids.
01:30:10.197,01:30:11.365,Grown?
01:30:13.867,01:30:15.660,Yeah.
01:30:15.702,01:30:18.663,"Yes, yes, they're all..."
01:30:20.414,01:30:22.918,"Were you a good dad, Raymond King?"
01:30:26.671,01:30:29.216,Yeah. I've been a good dad.
01:30:32.219,01:30:35.847,"I'm a lousy agent, and I've been a weak man..."
01:30:37.391,01:30:39.517,but that I didn't screw up.
01:30:41.061,01:30:42.520,That I got right.
01:30:56.743,01:30:58.494,Imagine you're a Treasury agent...
01:30:58.536,01:31:02.456,approaching the twilight of a spectacularly dismal career.
01:31:04.084,01:31:08.713,"And then one day, that break you should have been looking for."
01:31:08.755,01:31:12.050,"Francis Silverberg, a black money legend."
01:31:12.092,01:31:16.679,Cleaned cash from Monte Carlo to Havana to Vegas.
01:31:16.721,01:31:20.934,He cooked the books for the Gambino family for 40 plus years.
01:31:20.976,01:31:23.437,"Until one day, the boss, Big Tony Bazzano..."
01:31:23.477,01:31:27.232,thought maybe the old man's age made him vulnerable to prosecution.
01:31:27.274,01:31:30.944,Ordered his son Little Tony to kill Francis.
01:31:30.986,01:31:32.404,Kid fucked it up.
01:31:32.446,01:31:37.451,"Francis ran, became a federal informant in return for protective custody."
01:31:37.491,01:31:40.078,Could have turned my career around...
01:31:40.120,01:31:41.788,if only I'd listened.
01:31:43.665,01:31:45.417,I didn't.
01:31:45.459,01:31:49.296,"He was processed out, and he lost the only protection he had."
01:31:49.338,01:31:50.964,DETENTION GUARD: Stand clear of the gate.
01:31:51.006,01:31:55.802,RAY: The protection that he was promised when he testified against Big Tony.
01:31:58.972,01:32:02.600,"And this time, Little Tony got it right."
01:32:02.642,01:32:04.769,He had Francis in a couple hours.
01:32:06.313,01:32:10.150,"Down in a filthy basement in the Bronx, nailed to a chair..."
01:32:11.651,01:32:13.487,tortured to death.
01:32:16.614,01:32:21.577,So I volunteered for a joint task force.
01:32:21.619,01:32:24.664,Sat outside the Ravenite in a surveillance van for months...
01:32:24.706,01:32:27.834,hoping to get a shred of evidence to use against Francis' killers.
01:32:31.629,01:32:32.964,DON: Wait! Wait!
01:32:33.006,01:32:34.132,I gotta call it in!
01:32:36.009,01:32:37.844,Move it!
01:32:37.886,01:32:39.637,RAY: I went in there hoping I could ease my guilt.
01:32:41.973,01:32:43.683,And I met our accountant.
01:32:45.394,01:32:48.021,"Why he let me live, I didn't know."
01:32:49.563,01:32:51.441,But he changed my life.
01:32:54.694,01:32:57.697,Gave my notice at the Department.
01:32:57.739,01:33:00.492,I started looking forward to the day again.
01:33:00.534,01:33:03.786,"You know, feeling the sun on my face."
01:33:03.828,01:33:05.830,Quit drinking.
01:33:05.872,01:33:07.707,Was on my way out the door...
01:33:09.334,01:33:10.877,and then the phone rang.
01:33:11.503,01:33:12.628,Ray King.
01:33:12.670,01:33:14.256,I'll never forget that voice.
01:33:14.297,01:33:16.425,"WOMAN: Do you like puzzles, Raymond King?"
01:33:18.760,01:33:22.055,She tells me she works for the accountant.
01:33:22.097,01:33:25.559,And that a shipping container packed with Chinese nationals...
01:33:25.599,01:33:28.895,is passing through the Port of New York.
01:33:28.937,01:33:30.646,Few months later...
01:33:30.688,01:33:34.776,one ton of uncut Juarez cartel product is entering Miami.
01:33:36.861,01:33:39.573,All those cases you put together...
01:33:40.949,01:33:42.409,Smoke and mirrors.
01:33:46.371,01:33:47.747,So who is he?
01:33:49.249,01:33:50.375,This accountant.
01:33:50.417,01:33:51.709,Prisoner 831.
01:33:51.751,01:33:54.337,"Fort Leavenworth, maximum security."
01:33:54.379,01:33:55.589,Military prison?
01:33:56.590,01:33:57.924,So he was in the Army?
01:33:59.593,01:34:03.721,RAY: Army lent him to us to track al-Qaeda money launderers.
01:34:03.763,01:34:07.267,He was transferred from Leavenworth to our detention center in D.C.
01:34:08.810,01:34:10.895,Did the work of five men.
01:34:10.937,01:34:14.107,"Data mining, cluster analysis."
01:34:15.775,01:34:17.735,He roomed with Francis.
01:34:17.777,01:34:20.572,"They kept to themselves, played chess..."
01:34:20.614,01:34:24.117,"ate together, sat in the TV room together."
01:34:25.452,01:34:26.911,They were inseparable.
01:34:28.622,01:34:30.373,"And then one day, a guard told Wolff..."
01:34:30.415,01:34:34.419,why Francis hadn't called or written since he got out.
01:34:34.461,01:34:38.256,That his burnt body had been found in a Staten Island landfill.
01:34:40.133,01:34:43.637,"Wolff snapped, went after the guard."
01:34:43.677,01:34:47.599,He fractured the man's skull with a thermos.
01:34:47.641,01:34:49.518,Escaped from a third-floor window.
01:34:50.852,01:34:52.937,Took the thermos.
01:34:52.979,01:34:54.523,That's all you got?
01:34:54.564,01:34:56.316,"I mean, Leavenworth, he'll have military records."
01:34:56.358,01:34:58.151,Records are all heavily redacted.
01:34:58.193,01:35:00.487,"Well, then arrest records, something?"
01:35:00.529,01:35:04.491,"Spring of 2003, at a funeral home in Kankakee, Illinois."
01:35:05.992,01:35:10.205,Our boy sends six locals to the hospital with a variety of injuries.
01:35:11.956,01:35:13.958,No one knew Wolff.
01:35:14.000,01:35:18.338,"The older man who came with him was identified as a colonel, US Army."
01:35:20.382,01:35:21.799,A funeral home.
01:35:22.509,01:35:24.093,Whose wake?
01:35:24.135,01:35:26.179,One customer that day.
01:35:29.391,01:35:31.518,Mrs. Lauren Alton.
01:35:33.727,01:35:37.982,RAY: Mrs. Alton taught first grade for 13 years in Kankakee.
01:35:38.024,01:35:42.820,"Survived by a husband and two boys, ages 12 and 10."
01:35:42.862,01:35:46.032,"By all accounts, an ordinary life, well lived."
01:35:46.866,01:35:48.368,But cut short.
01:35:49.411,01:35:50.662,It'll be all right.
01:35:52.622,01:35:54.541,"FUNERAL DIRECTOR: Excuse me, sir, this is..."
01:35:54.583,01:35:57.043,family only.
01:35:57.085,01:36:00.463,"Sir, I'm going to ask you to step outside."
01:36:00.505,01:36:02.006,RAY: And then a fight breaks out.
01:36:02.048,01:36:04.884,"A brawl, really."
01:36:04.926,01:36:08.221,"Over what, the authorities never pinned down."
01:36:08.263,01:36:10.139,Get your hands...
01:36:13.727,01:36:16.020,Deputies respond.
01:36:16.062,01:36:21.359,"A Barney Fife-type squares off with our boy, gets rattled, pulls his gun."
01:36:21.401,01:36:24.904,The colonel just stepped in front of 831.
01:36:26.906,01:36:29.367,Army collects both men.
01:36:29.409,01:36:32.704,Police report names Wolff as Soldier One.
01:36:32.746,01:36:36.165,And widower identified the colonel by name.
01:36:36.207,01:36:38.918,His late wife's former husband.
01:36:38.960,01:36:41.546,I checked.
01:36:41.588,01:36:43.923,No more real than Christian Wolff.
01:36:47.594,01:36:50.263,She was the dead colonel's ex-wife.
01:36:52.806,01:36:55.435,And you think Wolff is what to him?
01:37:02.066,01:37:03.943,MARYBETH: Were you a good dad...
01:37:03.985,01:37:05.945,Ray King?
01:37:14.954,01:37:17.915,I've given up trying to figure out when I'll get a call.
01:37:17.957,01:37:21.753,"The why though, that I've got."
01:37:21.795,01:37:24.130,Someone breaks his moral code.
01:37:35.141,01:37:37.435,Why are you telling me this?
01:37:37.477,01:37:39.354,I'm retiring in a few months.
01:37:41.147,01:37:42.856,When she calls...
01:37:44.693,01:37:47.153,somebody needs to be there to answer.
01:38:02.001,01:38:03.169,No.
01:38:06.506,01:38:08.341,"He's a criminal, Ray."
01:38:08.383,01:38:09.801,Yeah.
01:38:09.843,01:38:12.846,"He aides and abets drug cartels, money launderers."
01:38:13.680,01:38:16.974,He's a fucking killer.
01:38:17.016,01:38:19.394,"Believe me, I wrestle with the same decision."
01:38:21.145,01:38:24.816,But when I got that first call...
01:38:24.858,01:38:26.651,I realized something.
01:38:29.987,01:38:35.577,I'd spent my whole life only recognizing my lucky breaks after they were gone.
01:38:42.709,01:38:44.252,"The Brit, who is she?"
01:38:58.182,01:38:59.392,Hello?
01:38:59.434,01:39:02.186,WOMAN: Miss Medina.
01:39:02.228,01:39:05.022,Tell Eliot Ness to get his feet off the furniture.
01:39:05.064,01:39:07.024,He's not in a barn.
01:39:08.902,01:39:10.236,Living Robotics.
01:39:11.070,01:39:12.530,Write it down.

01:39:19.495,01:39:20.789,LAMAR: Correct.
01:39:20.830,01:39:22.123,BRAX: But when you say short hair...
01:39:22.164,01:39:24.375,you mean short hair like my hair or you mean short hair like...
01:39:24.417,01:39:25.794,What's the difference?
01:39:25.835,01:39:27.336,"I was told you could fix this, so fix it!"
01:39:27.378,01:39:28.254,"But you did speak to the man, am I right?"
01:39:28.296,01:39:29.464,You spoke to him?
01:39:29.505,01:39:30.715,What did he sound like?
01:39:30.757,01:39:32.258,I didn't make small talk.
01:39:32.300,01:39:34.218,What's it matter what he sounded...
01:39:35.929,01:39:38.556,"That's Ike, right?"
01:39:38.598,01:39:40.600,"MAN: Yo, Bobby, was that you?"
01:39:42.560,01:39:43.561,Bob.
01:39:48.399,01:39:49.609,Bobby.
01:39:51.277,01:39:52.445,"Ike, are you there?"
01:39:53.987,01:39:56.699,Ike?
01:39:56.741,01:39:59.410,"Guys, stop fucking around."
01:39:59.452,01:40:01.203,Pull was to the left.
01:40:01.245,01:40:04.749,You might consider using a round with a superior ballistic coefficient.
01:40:07.794,01:40:09.545,Give me the layout of the home.
01:40:09.587,01:40:12.966,"Points of entry, corridors, rooms, cover."

01:40:58.344,01:40:59.387,"Get down, now!"
01:41:36.883,01:41:39.427,"Four men, front entrance."

01:49:09.251,01:49:10.669,You're gonna give me an answer.
01:49:12.129,01:49:13.881,Why would you and Pop go to that funeral?
01:49:13.922,01:49:15.548,She left us.

01:49:55.130,01:49:56.589,You don't give a shit about me?
01:49:56.631,01:49:57.966,You don't give a shit about me?
01:50:05.224,01:50:06.641,How about now?

01:51:22.301,01:51:24.886,If that was something that you had to do...
01:51:25.762,01:51:27.973,you call me.
01:51:28.015,01:51:31.852,I'm your brother.
01:51:31.893,01:51:34.146,"You don't call him, you call me."
01:51:40.944,01:51:42.904,Did you even wonder where I was?
01:51:42.946,01:51:45.616,I knew where you were.
01:51:45.658,01:51:47.826,I just wanted you to be safe.
01:51:47.868,01:51:50.204,Some of my clients are...
01:51:50.245,01:51:51.622,quite dangerous.
01:51:54.082,01:51:58.045,I'm kinda considered fairly dangerous myself.
01:52:00.130,01:52:01.882,"Well, you've made improvements."
01:52:10.474,01:52:11.933,"BRAX: Shit, man."
01:52:13.060,01:52:14.853,You and me here...
01:52:15.854,01:52:17.231,What are the odds?
01:52:17.272,01:52:18.940,Statistically speaking...
01:52:18.982,01:52:22.695,"Christ, man! It's rhetorical."
01:52:23.778,01:52:25.364,I was just saying.
01:52:29.326,01:52:31.828,Not happy.
01:52:31.870,01:52:35.416,"Do you consider what you do important, Mr. Wolff?"
01:52:35.457,01:52:38.126,"To someone other than yourself, I mean?"
01:52:38.168,01:52:40.753,What I do is.
01:52:40.795,01:52:44.966,Living Robotics' public offering would've been worth billions.
01:52:45.008,01:52:48.053,"Money to be used for neuroprosthetics, nanotechnology."
01:52:48.095,01:52:49.137,You...
01:52:51.223,01:52:53.601,Why in God's name did I ever hire you?
01:52:53.642,01:52:55.894,To leak-proof your books.
01:52:55.936,01:53:00.524,"Dana found a mistake, and you wanted to be sure it was safe to go public."
01:53:00.566,01:53:02.234,And now you want to kill her.
01:53:02.276,01:53:03.902,I'm fond of Dana.
01:53:03.944,01:53:06.655,"But I restore lives, not Dana! Me!"
01:53:06.697,01:53:08.949,"Men, women, children, I give them hope."
01:53:08.990,01:53:10.825,Make them whole.
01:53:10.867,01:53:12.578,Do you even know what that's like?
01:53:12.620,01:53:14.246,"Yes, I do."
01:53:28.343,01:53:29.470,Sorry.
01:53:33.432,01:53:34.849,I missed you.
01:53:42.023,01:53:43.816,"Missed you, too, Braxton."
01:53:46.445,01:53:48.280,"Missed you, too, because I love you."
01:53:49.448,01:53:51.032,You're my brother.
01:53:53.661,01:53:54.869,Maybe...
01:53:55.663,01:53:58.248,Do you want to...
01:53:58.290,01:54:00.417,Maybe I could see you in a week?
01:54:00.459,01:54:02.586,You name the place.
01:54:16.600,01:54:18.101,BRAX: How will I find you?
01:54:19.603,01:54:20.688,You won't.
01:54:21.605,01:54:23.148,I'll find you.
01:54:29.237,01:54:30.238,There.
01:54:31.824,01:54:33.617,How do you respond to rumors...
01:54:33.659,01:54:37.078,that some of the victims have wounds consistent with anti-aircraft rounds?
01:54:37.120,01:54:42.417,I'd say the Chicago Police Department has ample experience solving all manner of homicides.
01:54:44.670,01:54:46.046,TREASURY SECRETARY: Tom.
01:54:46.087,01:54:47.922,"Sir, how are the conspiracy and fraud charges..."
01:54:47.964,01:54:50.801,"related to the deaths of Lamar Blackburn and his sister, Rita?"
01:54:50.843,01:54:53.470,This is a very fluid situation...
01:54:53.512,01:54:57.265,with a lot of surprising revelations over the last 48 hours.
01:54:57.307,01:55:00.935,Let me introduce you to the person leading the investigation...
01:55:02.062,01:55:03.313,Agent Medina.
01:55:05.065,01:55:07.108,"REPORTER: Agent Medina, did you get a clear indication..."
01:55:14.949,01:55:16.201,Good afternoon.
01:55:19.705,01:55:22.916,As much as I'd like to take credit for this...
01:55:24.084,01:55:25.753,I can't.
01:55:33.260,01:55:36.304,Because this was a team effort...
01:55:36.346,01:55:41.017,comprised of long hours of good old-fashioned investigative work.
01:55:41.059,01:55:42.477,Questions?
01:55:42.519,01:55:43.896,REPORTER 2: Can we get more information...
01:55:48.567,01:55:50.026,WOMAN: He was just like our other two.
01:55:50.068,01:55:52.028,He was a happy baby.
01:55:52.070,01:55:55.198,Now he rarely speaks.
01:55:55.240,01:55:57.743,It's like our child is missing. He's not there.
01:55:57.785,01:56:00.245,He's lost and he needs our help.
01:56:01.371,01:56:02.748,We thought...
01:56:04.583,01:56:06.000,We thought...
01:56:06.042,01:56:08.712,We hoped that he would catch back up.
01:56:09.630,01:56:11.131,But he didn't.
01:56:11.172,01:56:16.386,NEUROLOGIST: One in 68 children in this country are diagnosed with a form of autism.
01:56:16.428,01:56:18.096,But if you can put aside for a moment...
01:56:18.138,01:56:21.892,what your pediatrician and all the other NTs have said about your son...
01:56:21.934,01:56:23.727,MAN: What? NTs?
01:56:23.769,01:56:25.771,NEUROLOGIST: Neurotypicals.
01:56:25.813,01:56:27.439,The rest of us.
01:56:28.732,01:56:30.859,What if we're wrong?
01:56:30.901,01:56:33.111,What if we've been using the wrong tests...
01:56:33.153,01:56:36.490,to quantify intelligence in children with autism?
01:56:38.116,01:56:39.618,Your son's not less than.
01:56:41.119,01:56:43.371,He's different.
01:56:43.413,01:56:47.292,"Now, your expectations for your son may change over time."
01:56:47.334,01:56:52.046,"They might include marriage, children, self-sufficiency."
01:56:52.088,01:56:53.632,And they might not.
01:56:54.800,01:56:56.301,But I guarantee you...
01:56:56.343,01:57:00.347,"if we let the world set expectations for our children, they'll start low..."
01:57:01.640,01:57:03.016,and they'll stay there.
01:57:05.519,01:57:08.355,Maybe your son's capable of much more than we know.
01:57:10.190,01:57:11.942,And maybe...
01:57:11.984,01:57:14.277,just maybe...
01:57:14.319,01:57:15.988,he doesn't understand how to tell us.
01:57:17.823,01:57:20.241,Or...
01:57:20.283,01:57:23.036,we haven't yet learned how to listen.
01:57:49.354,01:57:52.148,"Honey, for the hundredth time, don't wander off like that."
01:57:52.190,01:57:54.651,I'm so sorry.
01:57:54.693,01:57:56.695,"Can he visit with you for a while, Justine?"
01:57:58.822,01:58:01.324,"Okay, good. Come on, folks."
01:58:01.366,01:58:02.826,You okay with that?
01:58:02.868,01:58:04.661,"MAN: It's okay, hon. Come on."
01:58:04.703,01:58:06.413,"NEUROLOGIST: No, they'll be fine."
01:58:09.041,01:58:11.501,Justine's one of our few full-time residents.
01:58:11.543,01:58:14.004,She stopped talking 30 years ago.
01:58:14.046,01:58:17.340,Communicates with a digital translator now.
01:58:17.382,01:58:19.342,"WOMAN: Doctor, how is Harbor funded?"
01:58:19.384,01:58:22.846,We're fortunate to have very generous private donors.
01:58:22.888,01:58:24.347,MAN: I'll say they're generous.
01:58:24.389,01:58:25.724,"NEUROLOGIST: Oh, why is that?"
01:58:25.766,01:58:27.684,"That woman, Justine..."
01:58:27.726,01:58:28.894,"Yeah, my daughter."
01:58:28.936,01:58:30.186,She's your daughter?
01:58:30.228,01:58:32.814,The reason I started the institute.
01:58:32.856,01:58:35.525,"Justine's computer, it's a BX32."
01:58:35.567,01:58:37.945,"Water cooled, 12 core."
01:58:37.986,01:58:40.697,"NEUROLOGIST: Oh, that's right."
01:58:40.739,01:58:44.576,"Well, some of our donors are more generous than others."
01:58:44.618,01:58:47.079,Why? Is that a good computer?
01:58:47.120,01:58:48.830,MAN: Good?
01:58:48.872,01:58:57.380,"Doc, she could backdoor the Pentagon with Hello, dreamboat."
01:59:03.303,01:59:25.450,But I know you well Lie to me That you sell To the end of the world Hi.
01:59:25.492,01:59:26.994,"Sign here, please."

01:59:33.207,01:59:35.376,Thanks.
01:59:35.418,02:01:24.152,"From men and mouth Help thinking The wrong crowd My job will be, too To leave something behind More than a brick Hard to reach Is broken and rigged To leave something behind Is a foreign land Our own hand Oh, but we ain't got the gold To leave something behind We are at the wrong side What I did not write Oh, but the master is gone To leave something behind."
