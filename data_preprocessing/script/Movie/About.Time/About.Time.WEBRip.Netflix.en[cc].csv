00:00:54.291,00:00:57.208,I always knew we were a fairly odd family.
00:00:57.250,00:01:02.125,First there was me.
00:01:02.166,00:01:05.083,"My mum was lovely, but not like other mums."
00:01:05.125,00:01:09.208,"There was something solid about her-- something rectangular, busy and unsentimental."
00:01:09.250,00:01:11.000,Her fashion icon was the queen.
00:01:12.083,00:01:14.667,"Dad-- Well, he was more normal."
00:01:14.709,00:01:16.834,He always seemed to have time on his hands.
00:01:16.875,00:01:22.417,"After giving up teaching university students on his 50th birthday, he was eternally available for a leisurely chat..."
00:01:22.458,00:01:24.709,or to let me win at table tennis.
00:01:24.750,00:01:26.667,- Ah!
00:01:26.709,00:01:29.000,"Then there was Mum's brother, Uncle Desmond."
00:01:29.041,00:01:34.959,"Always impeccably dressed, he spent the days just, well, being Uncle Desmond."
00:01:35.000,00:01:38.583,He was the most charming and least clever man you could ever meet.
00:01:38.625,00:01:41.750,"His mind was on other things, though we never found out what."
00:01:41.792,00:01:45.583,And then finally there was Catherine. Katie.
00:01:45.625,00:01:47.750,Kit Kat. My sister.
00:01:47.792,00:01:50.208,In a household of sensible jackets and haircuts...
00:01:50.250,00:01:54.000,"there was this-- Well, what can I call her?-- nature thing."
00:01:54.041,00:01:56.417,"With her elfin eyes, her purple T-shirts..."
00:01:56.458,00:02:04.583,"and her eternally bare feet, she was then, and still is to me, about the most wonderful thing in the world."
00:02:04.625,00:02:06.792,"- All in all, it was a pretty good childhood."
00:02:06.834,00:02:09.291,Full of repeated rhythms and patterns.
00:02:09.333,00:02:13.417,"By the time I was 21, we were still having tea on the beach every single day."
00:02:13.458,00:02:18.625,"Skimming stones and eating sandwiches, summer and winter, no matter what the weather."
00:02:18.667,00:02:20.667,Oh! Oh!
00:02:23.208,00:02:29.500,"And every Friday evening, a film-- no matter what the weather."
00:02:29.542,00:02:34.542,"- And then, once a year, the dreaded New Year's Eve party."
00:02:34.583,00:02:36.625,Hey.
00:02:40.875,00:02:53.583,Running through my head I might just...
00:02:56.250,00:02:59.250,You're absolutely gorgeous.
00:03:00.750,00:03:02.500,I'm Katie.
00:03:03.709,00:03:05.500,This is very expensive stuff.
00:03:05.542,00:03:07.166,Cheers.
00:03:11.000,00:03:13.917,"- Shh, shh, shh."
00:03:13.959,00:03:24.709,you better push the button Come on.
00:03:24.750,00:03:26.875,We're going through.
00:03:24.750,00:03:28.667,"I've gotta find you a-- Oh! Oh, no!"
00:03:28.709,00:03:30.667,"Oh, God!"
00:03:30.709,00:03:33.291,Everyone makes little mistakes.
00:03:33.333,00:03:35.959,Come on.
00:03:36.000,00:03:41.125,"Six, five, four, three, two, one."
00:03:41.166,00:03:43.083,Happy New Year!
00:03:43.125,00:03:45.291,Happy New Year!
00:03:47.125,00:03:48.625,Sorry.
00:04:00.208,00:04:05.083,"And so I woke up the next morning, hungover, ashamed of myself..."
00:04:05.125,00:04:08.083,and not realizing it was the day that would change my life forever.
00:04:09.250,00:04:11.500,"Get up, stupid."
00:04:14.125,00:04:15.834,Dad wants you.
00:04:15.875,00:04:18.125,"Oh, hello."
00:04:23.375,00:04:25.667,Ah. Tim. Come in.
00:04:25.709,00:04:29.041,"Uh, do... sit down."
00:04:31.291,00:04:33.667,That's very formal.
00:04:33.709,00:04:35.750,"Well, um, yeah."
00:04:35.792,00:04:43.500,"This is an odd moment for me, because I had the same moment with my father when I'd just turned 21, and after it..."
00:04:43.542,00:04:48.792,"my life was never the same, so I approach it pretty, um, nervously."
00:04:48.834,00:04:51.750,Okay. When you're ready.
00:04:51.792,00:04:53.875,"Uh, right."
00:04:55.834,00:05:03.625,"Tim, my dear son, uh, the, uh-- the simple fact is the men in this family..."
00:05:03.667,00:05:08.792,have always had the ability to-- This is going to sound strange.
00:05:08.834,00:05:11.125,Be prepared for strangeness.
00:05:11.166,00:05:16.458,Get ready for spooky time.
00:05:16.500,00:05:20.542,And the secret is that the men in the family can...
00:05:23.208,00:05:25.041,travel in time.
00:05:27.542,00:05:29.583,"Well, more accurately, travel back in time."
00:05:29.625,00:05:31.500,We can't travel into the future.
00:05:31.542,00:05:33.417,This is such a weird joke.
00:05:33.458,00:05:35.667,It's seriously not a joke.
00:05:37.709,00:05:41.208,So you're saying that you and Granddad...
00:05:41.250,00:05:44.125,and his brothers could all travel back in time?
00:05:44.166,00:05:46.041,- Absolutely.
00:05:46.083,00:05:49.125,Absolutely.
00:05:49.166,00:05:53.166,It's only in my own life.
00:05:53.208,00:05:55.083,I can't kill Hitler or...
00:05:55.125,00:05:57.166,"shag Helen of Troy, unfortunately."
00:05:57.208,00:06:03.709,"Okay, stop. Um-- - If it's true, which it isn't-- - Although it is."
00:06:03.750,00:06:06.250,"Although it isn't, obviously."
00:06:03.750,00:06:09.291,"But if it was, which it's not-- - Which it is."
00:06:06.291,00:06:11.583,"- Which it isn't. But if it was, how would I actually-- The how is the easy bit, in fact."
00:06:11.625,00:06:22.000,"You go into a dark place-- big cupboards are very useful generally, toilets, at a pinch-- then you clench your fists like this, think of the moment you're going to, and you'll find yourself there."
00:06:22.041,00:06:25.542,After a bit of a stumble and a rumble and a tumble.
00:06:25.583,00:06:27.000,Wow.
00:06:27.041,00:06:29.041,Is as good a reaction as any.
00:06:29.083,00:06:33.500,I think I plumped for Fuck!
00:06:33.542,00:06:36.500,"- No, this is so obviously a joke."
00:06:36.542,00:06:40.166,Why would I lie to someone I'm...
00:06:40.208,00:06:42.583,fairly fond of?
00:06:42.625,00:06:49.166,"But when I come back downstairs after standing in a cupboard with my fists clenched, you're gonna be in so much trouble."
00:06:49.208,00:06:50.875,"Well, let's see, shall we?"
00:06:50.917,00:06:53.458,Mmm.
00:06:53.500,00:06:55.667,"Oh, and, Tim, try and do something interesting."
00:06:55.709,00:06:58.041,So much trouble.
00:06:58.083,00:07:00.083,I mean it. Really.
00:07:09.250,00:07:10.917,Right.
00:07:22.333,00:07:23.625,Dad wants you.
00:07:44.709,00:07:46.166,Wow.
00:08:02.375,00:08:05.875,"You all right, Tim?"
00:08:05.917,00:08:08.625,Good. Come on.
00:08:05.917,00:08:10.208,"It's nearly midnight, and we've got to find-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:08:13.834,00:08:16.041,Whoo! Midnight!
00:08:16.083,00:08:24.333,"Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
00:08:24.375,00:08:26.375,Happy New Year!
00:08:34.500,00:08:37.625,"Thank you, Tim."
00:09:01.583,00:09:03.500,- Does Mum know?
00:09:03.542,00:09:05.709,Strange.
00:09:05.750,00:09:08.291,What can I say?
00:09:08.333,00:09:10.083,It's gonna be a complicated year.
00:09:10.125,00:09:12.875,It's gonna be a complicated life.
00:09:12.917,00:09:15.083,What have you done with... it?
00:09:15.125,00:09:17.417,"For me, it's books, books, books."
00:09:17.458,00:09:20.875,I've read everything a man could wish to-- twice.
00:09:20.917,00:09:22.792,Dickens three times.
00:09:22.834,00:09:25.208,Any first thoughts?
00:09:25.250,00:09:30.166,"Well, I suppose apart from getting a slightly better haircut-- Yeah."
00:09:30.208,00:09:33.125,Very mixed blessing.
00:09:33.166,00:09:35.166,Left him without love or friends.
00:09:35.208,00:09:37.500,I've never bumped into a genuinely happy rich person.
00:09:37.542,00:09:39.667,It would be nice not to have to work.
00:09:39.709,00:09:42.500,"No, that's a real recipe for disaster. Look what happened to Uncle Fred."
00:09:42.542,00:09:45.083,- What happened to Uncle Fred?
00:09:45.125,00:09:47.208,Wasted his life.
00:09:47.250,00:09:49.375,You have to use it for things that you really think...
00:09:49.417,00:09:51.333,will make your life the way you want it to be.
00:09:51.375,00:09:53.834,Come on.
00:09:53.875,00:10:02.250,"Well, to be honest, I suppose, at the moment, it would be just great if it could help me get a girlfriend."
00:10:02.291,00:10:04.583,Wow.
00:10:05.667,00:10:07.625,Massive.
00:10:08.875,00:10:11.625,The mother ship.
00:10:11.667,00:10:15.917,"For me, it was always gonna be about love."
00:10:15.959,00:10:18.375,And that summer I walked into the eye of the storm.
00:10:20.583,00:10:25.208,"Her name was Charlotte, cousin of Kit Kat's handsome but nasty boyfriend Jimmy."
00:10:27.583,00:10:30.083,And she was staying two whole months.
00:10:34.041,00:10:36.625,Just one.
00:10:38.417,00:10:40.083,Tim.
00:10:40.125,00:10:42.250,Will you do my back?
00:10:42.291,00:10:44.834,Absolutely.
00:10:47.417,00:10:49.834,Very keen.
00:10:51.500,00:10:53.458,"- Oh! Oh, no!"
00:10:53.500,00:10:55.709,"Oh, no!"
00:10:55.750,00:10:57.458,"No, no."
00:10:55.750,00:10:58.792,What-- Are you okay?
00:10:58.834,00:11:00.333,Is it in my hair?
00:11:08.375,00:11:11.625,Tim.
00:11:11.667,00:11:14.166,Sure.
00:11:16.291,00:11:18.041,Okay.
00:11:30.083,00:11:31.750,Thank you.
00:11:33.834,00:11:44.250,"Now-- Oh, nice."
00:11:44.291,00:11:45.667,It's my area.
00:11:48.959,00:11:52.333,It was a summer of suntan and torture.
00:11:52.375,00:11:54.583,I invited my foolish friend Jay around for tennis...
00:11:54.625,00:11:56.291,because I thought he'd make me look good.
00:11:56.333,00:11:57.750,Beauty!
00:11:58.542,00:12:00.041,"- Oh, oh!"
00:12:00.709,00:12:01.709,Ah!
00:12:01.750,00:12:02.583,Aaah!
00:12:02.625,00:12:04.917,- I was wrong.
00:12:04.959,00:12:06.959,- What are you doing?
00:12:07.000,00:12:09.917,- Aaah!
00:12:09.959,00:12:11.750,- Charlotte just made both of us look like idiots.
00:12:11.792,00:12:13.250,"Bad luck, Tim."
00:12:18.250,00:12:21.375,How the hell are you meant to concentrate on your game?
00:12:21.417,00:12:23.417,How are you meant to live your life...
00:12:23.458,00:12:25.792,with this sort of shit going down?
00:12:27.166,00:12:29.083,It never got better...
00:12:29.125,00:12:31.834,until suddenly it was almost too late.
00:12:31.875,00:12:35.250,"Well, um-- Well, Charlotte, our final lunch."
00:12:35.291,00:12:37.333,No!
00:12:37.375,00:12:40.709,"And it's been really, really lovely having you all summer."
00:12:40.750,00:12:42.834,It has.
00:12:42.875,00:12:45.709,It has.
00:12:45.750,00:12:49.083,- Beg your pardon?
00:12:49.125,00:12:51.125,Charlotte?
00:12:51.166,00:12:53.083,"Come on, darling."
00:12:54.583,00:12:56.625,"Oh, yes, of course."
00:12:56.667,00:12:58.458,Of course.
00:12:58.500,00:13:00.125,Lovely to meet you.
00:13:04.625,00:13:07.709,"Have you enjoyed having Charlotte here all summer, Tim?"
00:13:09.458,00:13:11.500,Yeah.
00:13:11.542,00:13:13.500,There goes August.
00:13:13.542,00:13:15.750,"I've introduced him to most things, haven't I, darling?"
00:13:15.792,00:13:17.875,"Yeah. Well, you did. You were much more sophisticated."
00:13:17.917,00:13:20.542,"In a quiet way, I like to think."
00:13:34.291,00:13:35.750,Come in.
00:13:37.875,00:13:39.041,Charlotte.
00:13:41.542,00:13:46.750,"Um, as it's your last night, can I ask you a question?"
00:13:46.792,00:13:49.333,Oh. Yeah.
00:13:49.375,00:13:55.667,"Oh, no, wait. Um-- It's not going to be about love, is it?"
00:13:55.709,00:13:58.250,Love? What?
00:13:58.291,00:14:03.250,"that if you were to ever mention it, I should be very firm with you and tell you..."
00:14:03.291,00:14:05.250,you must treat me like your sister...
00:14:05.291,00:14:07.083,and not be stupid.
00:14:07.125,00:14:14.333,"Or have I just made a total fool of myself, and you were actually going to ask me for late-night, last-minute tennis tips?"
00:14:14.375,00:14:16.834,"No, it-it-it was-- it was the love thing."
00:14:16.875,00:14:23.250,"Oh. Well, that's very sweet of you."
00:14:23.291,00:14:26.709,It's just a shame you left it till the last night.
00:14:26.750,00:14:31.333,You should have tried creeping along the corridor while we still had time.
00:14:31.375,00:14:35.917,Okay. The last night was a bad idea?
00:14:35.959,00:14:39.792,It feels like an ever so slightly insulting afterthought.
00:14:39.834,00:14:42.000,Last night was never going to work.
00:14:42.041,00:14:44.166,All right.
00:14:44.208,00:14:46.166,Good.
00:14:58.333,00:14:59.542,Tennis tips.
00:15:05.959,00:15:07.500,Come in.
00:15:08.834,00:15:10.083,Tim.
00:15:10.125,00:15:11.291,Hi.
00:15:12.250,00:15:13.917,Hi.
00:15:16.458,00:15:22.917,"I know you've probably suspected this, but over the last month I've fallen completely in love with you."
00:15:24.959,00:15:27.542,"Now, obviously this-- this was gonna happen..."
00:15:27.583,00:15:29.917,because-- because you're a goddess...
00:15:29.959,00:15:31.625,with-- with that face...
00:15:31.667,00:15:33.834,and that hair.
00:15:33.875,00:15:47.083,"But even if you didn't have a nice face, and even if you had absolutely no hair, because of some bizarre medical reason, um, I'd still adore you."
00:15:47.125,00:15:53.792,"And I-- I just wondered whether, by any chance, you might share my feelings."
00:15:54.792,00:15:56.625,Wow.
00:15:56.667,00:15:59.542,Tell you what.
00:15:59.583,00:16:05.333,"Why don't we see how the summer goes, and then you ask me again on my last night?"
00:16:07.375,00:16:09.208,Your last night?
00:16:09.250,00:16:12.041,Try me on the last night.
00:16:12.083,00:16:14.834,"See what happens then, shall we?"
00:16:14.875,00:16:17.750,It's exciting.
00:16:17.792,00:16:20.041,"No, that's a perfect plan."
00:16:20.083,00:16:21.959,That's absolutely perfect.
00:16:22.000,00:16:23.375,Last night.
00:16:26.333,00:16:28.166,Thanks very much.
00:16:28.208,00:16:30.250,"Night-night, Timmy."
00:16:38.083,00:16:43.542,Big lesson number one: All the time travel in the world can't make someone love you.
00:16:43.583,00:16:44.917,Bye!
00:16:44.959,00:16:47.625,So the love of my life just drove away.
00:16:49.375,00:16:52.750,And the very next day it was my turn to leave.
00:16:55.792,00:16:59.041,There you go.
00:17:00.750,00:17:01.667,Thanks.
00:17:03.542,00:17:06.500,Don't call too often.
00:17:06.542,00:17:08.375,Okay.
00:17:08.417,00:17:09.875,Thanks.
00:17:27.417,00:17:29.417,I caught the train to London...
00:17:29.458,00:17:31.834,in search of a future...
00:17:34.458,00:17:40.709,"I was staying in St. John's Wood, near Abbey Road, with a playwright friend of my dad's called Harry."
00:17:40.750,00:17:43.959,It's always nice to have family connections when you're a new kid in town.
00:17:57.291,00:18:01.166,What the fuck do you want?
00:18:03.125,00:18:06.250,I'm James's son.
00:18:06.291,00:18:07.667,James Lake.
00:18:07.709,00:18:08.709,What about him?
00:18:11.583,00:18:13.500,He said you had a room.
00:18:15.041,00:18:18.208,Go in there and wait.
00:18:18.250,00:18:22.417,Quietly. I mean it.
00:18:18.250,00:18:24.041,"Don't make a sound, or I'll kill you."
00:18:34.959,00:18:39.417,I was actually having the first good idea I've had for a decade when you rang on the doorbell.
00:18:39.458,00:18:41.834,But now it's gone.
00:18:41.875,00:18:43.875,You little shit.
00:18:43.917,00:18:46.083,How's your dad?
00:18:46.125,00:18:48.458,"Weird cock, I always thought."
00:18:48.500,00:18:50.959,Something weird about him.
00:18:51.000,00:18:53.500,"Yeah, I never really liked him, actually."
00:18:55.041,00:18:57.250,Your mum still look like Andy Warhol?
00:18:57.291,00:18:59.625,What?
00:18:59.667,00:19:02.250,"That, by the way, is my wife."
00:19:02.291,00:19:05.166,Oh. Nice.
00:19:06.709,00:19:08.583,Sarcastic cow.
00:19:09.834,00:19:12.500,But eventually you'd realize that...
00:19:12.542,00:19:15.917,she's the best human being in the world.
00:19:15.959,00:19:17.875,"Which is why she left me, of course."
00:19:20.542,00:19:22.166,Here you go.
00:19:22.208,00:19:26.542,"Try not to make too much noise, particularly when having sex."
00:19:26.583,00:19:29.041,No chance of that.
00:19:29.083,00:19:31.291,Two losers in one house.
00:19:31.333,00:19:34.333,- That is my daughter.
00:19:34.375,00:19:36.375,Have sex with her if you like.
00:19:36.417,00:19:38.208,Apparently everyone else has.
00:19:40.875,00:19:43.250,It wasn't a hopeful setup for romance.
00:19:43.291,00:19:47.041,And the work didn't help on that score either.
00:19:47.083,00:19:49.625,The world of law seems to be entirely full of men.
00:19:51.792,00:19:53.333,"Oh, hello."
00:19:53.375,00:19:56.583,I'm Rory. Very pleased to meet you.
00:19:56.625,00:20:00.875,"Well, who knows, we might become, you know, pals, et cetera."
00:20:00.917,00:20:03.458,- Who the hell are you?
00:20:03.500,00:20:05.750,"Well, I hope you're better than this clown."
00:20:05.792,00:20:09.458,"Come on, Roger."
00:20:09.500,00:20:11.458,Been here a year and a half.
00:20:11.500,00:20:14.125,I'm just saying that to be nice.
00:20:16.083,00:20:20.542,"So six lonely months went by, and it was still just me and Harry."
00:20:20.583,00:20:26.542,"Me lawyering every hour of the day and night, and him putting the finishing touches to his new play."
00:20:28.667,00:20:33.083,"No matter how many girls there were in the world, I always seemed to end up-- How you doing?"
00:20:33.125,00:20:35.792,with Rory.
00:20:35.834,00:20:37.667,Hey.
00:20:35.834,00:20:43.333,"Until, out of the blue, on a dodgy night out with dodgy Jay, something miraculous happened."
00:20:43.375,00:20:48.166,"The waiters are-- Wait for this, right?"
00:20:48.208,00:20:50.750,"Oh, you're kidding me."
00:20:50.792,00:20:52.667,As bats!
00:20:52.709,00:20:56.667,"Very good to have you here, gentlemen. I hope you enjoy your experience."
00:20:56.709,00:20:58.917,Carlo will show you to your table.
00:20:58.959,00:21:01.458,Great.
00:21:01.500,00:21:04.083,Right.
00:21:04.125,00:21:06.000,And your friend hold on to your shoulder.
00:21:06.041,00:21:07.709,Thank you.
00:21:10.291,00:21:13.709,"Mind the stairs, and be prepared, because..."
00:21:13.750,00:21:15.667,it's completely dark.
00:21:17.834,00:21:19.709,"Okay, gentlemen."
00:21:17.834,00:21:22.333,"If you don't mind, I can sit you here beside these two young ladies."
00:21:22.375,00:21:24.458,"No, no."
00:21:24.500,00:21:26.667,"Oh, God, you sound very perky."
00:21:26.709,00:21:29.458,I am. And very handsome.
00:21:29.500,00:21:31.500,Ooh. Someone's there.
00:21:31.542,00:21:34.166,"Oh, hi. I'm Mary."
00:21:34.208,00:21:36.083,"Mary's my mother's name, actually."
00:21:36.125,00:21:38.875,Oh. Does it suit her?
00:21:38.917,00:21:42.166,"Although she's sturdy, so Bernard might have been a better fit."
00:21:42.208,00:21:45.041,Okay.
00:21:45.083,00:21:47.709,Oh! Something just touched my elbow.
00:21:47.750,00:21:49.542,"Ooh. Okay, that wasn't me."
00:21:49.583,00:21:53.125,"Oh, no, well, that just makes it worse."
00:21:53.166,00:21:56.291,because I'm touching something else.
00:21:56.333,00:21:59.375,"stop that right away, thank you."
00:21:59.417,00:22:03.750,"So, girls, be honest, who is more beautiful?"
00:22:03.792,00:22:05.792,"Oh, I am."
00:22:05.834,00:22:08.834,I look like Kate Moss.
00:22:08.875,00:22:10.834,Really?
00:22:10.875,00:22:14.375,I sort of look like a squirrel.
00:22:14.417,00:22:17.500,Do you like Kate Moss?
00:22:17.542,00:22:20.041,"In fact, I almost wore one of her dresses here tonight."
00:22:20.083,00:22:22.625,You?
00:22:25.917,00:22:28.542,that it's your birthday next week as well.
00:22:28.583,00:22:32.125,"Your friend Jay-- he's quite, um, enthusiastic."
00:22:32.166,00:22:34.458,I actually hate him.
00:22:34.500,00:22:37.083,What's Joanna like?
00:22:37.125,00:22:38.959,Yeah.
00:22:39.000,00:22:41.083,I think it's strawberry mousse.
00:22:41.125,00:22:43.959,Do you want some?
00:22:44.000,00:22:47.208,"Okay, where's your mouth?"
00:22:44.000,00:22:48.875,"Uh, it's-- It's here."
00:22:48.917,00:22:50.458,"Mmm, there?"
00:22:50.500,00:22:52.250,Oh!
00:22:52.291,00:22:54.333,That's my eye.
00:22:54.375,00:22:59.166,I think there's a lot of-- I've got quite a lot of strawberry mousse in my eye now.
00:22:59.208,00:23:01.834,I'm so sorry.
00:23:01.875,00:23:04.250,That's a new sensation for me.
00:23:06.083,00:23:12.041,"So maybe I'll see you outside, or-- Yeah. Yeah, great."
00:23:12.083,00:23:14.041,Great. Scary.
00:23:14.083,00:23:16.375,"Yeah, it's a bit scary."
00:23:16.417,00:23:20.000,"Oh, my God."
00:23:20.041,00:23:22.583,"I don't know, but she sounded wonderful."
00:23:22.625,00:23:24.125,"Oh, shh."
00:23:25.208,00:23:26.959,Joanna?
00:23:27.000,00:23:29.291,"Christ, you're a babe."
00:23:29.333,00:23:32.709,How do you fancy stretching the night out a bit?
00:23:32.750,00:23:35.875,"Look, we've got to rush, but, um, help me find a cab, and I might give you my number."
00:23:35.917,00:23:38.709,Of course. Yeah.
00:23:38.750,00:23:40.792,"No, I have."
00:24:07.542,00:24:09.000,- Hi.
00:24:10.750,00:24:15.083,"Where-- Where's-- Oh, um, she and Jay just-- She took him to-- I-- I don't know."
00:24:15.125,00:24:16.959,"Oh, right."
00:24:17.000,00:24:22.750,"Oh, well, I guess I-- I'd better, um-- Would it be very wrong if I asked you for your number?"
00:24:24.875,00:24:26.375,No.
00:24:26.417,00:24:31.250,"Just in case I ever, you know, had to call you about-- Stuff."
00:24:32.208,00:24:33.625,Okay.
00:24:37.041,00:24:41.083,Would you-- It's Mary.
00:24:41.125,00:24:42.792,Mary.
00:24:42.834,00:24:45.500,Okay.
00:24:45.542,00:24:51.166,"I thought this phone was old and shit, but suddenly it's my most valuable possession."
00:24:51.208,00:24:53.792,You really like me?
00:24:55.667,00:24:58.500,Even... my frock?
00:24:58.542,00:25:01.333,I love your frock.
00:25:01.375,00:25:04.875,"And, um, my hair?"
00:25:04.917,00:25:07.750,I love brown.
00:25:07.792,00:25:11.959,- My fringe is new.
00:25:12.000,00:25:14.208,Mary! We have to go!
00:25:14.250,00:25:16.667,"I found a cab, and his dodgy friend is about to assault me."
00:25:16.709,00:25:19.125,Okay.
00:25:19.166,00:25:21.458,Two seconds.
00:25:21.500,00:25:23.458,I hope I see you again.
00:25:23.500,00:25:25.166,You will.
00:25:25.208,00:25:27.083,Okay.
00:25:27.125,00:25:28.583,Good.
00:25:29.875,00:25:31.500,Good night.
00:25:31.542,00:25:33.083,Good night.
00:26:10.458,00:26:12.500,What's happened?
00:26:12.542,00:26:14.542,"What have you done, you poor thing?"
00:26:14.583,00:26:18.083,"Oh, nothing."
00:26:18.125,00:26:20.166,There.
00:26:22.792,00:26:24.875,You may remember my play opened tonight.
00:26:24.917,00:26:27.166,"Oh, my God, yes."
00:26:27.208,00:26:28.875,Well.
00:26:28.917,00:26:32.625,You could tell in the room a masterpiece was being unfurled.
00:26:32.667,00:26:34.959,Really?
00:26:35.000,00:26:43.333,"Until-- and this is the crucial plot point, I think-- until the lead actor had the most massive dry in the history of theater."
00:26:43.375,00:26:46.542,"- No, no, no."
00:26:46.583,00:26:48.625,He didn't just forget his lines.
00:26:48.667,00:26:50.792,He forgot his lines to the extent that no actor...
00:26:50.834,00:26:55.458,has ever forgotten their lines before in the annals of dramatic art.
00:26:55.500,00:26:58.709,"The reviews won't say, Major masterpiece gets unveiled."
00:26:58.750,00:27:02.625,"They'll say, Major actor gets Alzheimer's."
00:27:02.667,00:27:05.166,It's a disaster.
00:27:05.208,00:27:07.208,Is an understatement.
00:27:07.250,00:27:13.291,"It's the Titanic of play openings, but with no survivors."
00:27:13.333,00:27:16.083,"No women, no children."
00:27:16.125,00:27:18.625,Not even Kate Winslet.
00:27:18.667,00:27:20.667,All dead.
00:27:21.417,00:27:23.208,Okay.
00:27:23.250,00:27:26.208,- I'll see what I can do.
00:27:26.250,00:27:28.625,What are you gonna do?
00:27:28.667,00:27:31.417,and offer them a blow job if they ignore the fact...
00:27:31.458,00:27:35.083,that we sat in total silence for half an hour...
00:27:35.125,00:27:39.959,waiting for a moron to remember one single line?
00:27:40.000,00:27:41.709,Not quite that.
00:27:58.417,00:28:00.125,Hello?
00:28:03.208,00:28:05.250,"Hello, um, Sir Tom."
00:28:05.291,00:28:08.458,I'm a friend of Harry's.
00:28:08.500,00:28:11.458,"Um-- Um, I'm sorry."
00:28:11.500,00:28:23.000,"Uh, it's just, you know, in the court scenes, some of those lines are pretty complex, and I just thought maybe it might be worth, you know, having one last look at the lines before you go on."
00:28:23.041,00:28:25.834,"Uh, a little refresher."
00:28:25.875,00:28:30.625,"Fuck off out of here, you assing lunatic."
00:28:30.667,00:28:32.458,Okay.
00:28:32.500,00:28:33.542,Sorry.
00:28:33.583,00:28:50.417,"Patronizing piece of-- Five, um-- And now the defense."
00:29:00.041,00:29:02.333,I have lived...
00:29:02.375,00:29:07.583,many weary years-- It's brilliant.
00:29:07.625,00:29:11.709,in that long catalog of wasted time...
00:29:11.750,00:29:16.458,have I ever seen such an atrocious miscarriage of justice.
00:29:21.792,00:29:26.375,Do the prosecution have anything final to add?
00:30:10.500,00:30:13.417,Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.
00:30:20.125,00:30:22.625,Do the prosecution...
00:30:22.667,00:30:24.625,have anything final to add?
00:30:32.083,00:30:33.542,Psst.
00:30:38.417,00:30:39.917,I don't know.
00:30:39.959,00:30:41.250,Gentlemen.
00:30:43.959,00:30:47.875,"Gentlemen, I regard today's proceedings..."
00:30:47.917,00:30:49.834,with the utmost gravity.
00:30:49.875,00:30:55.041,"Nevertheless, let us be clear of one..."
00:30:56.792,00:30:59.750,simple and salient thing.
00:31:03.125,00:31:05.250,It is the life...
00:31:05.291,00:31:07.166,of a guilty man!
00:31:18.000,00:31:19.959,One of the actors appeared...
00:31:20.000,00:31:25.667,"to have actually fallen asleep at one period, but-- Oh, here's the little prick who walked out halfway through."
00:31:25.709,00:31:27.625,"You missed the best scene, you little twerp."
00:31:27.667,00:31:29.125,Sorry.
00:31:29.166,00:31:31.583,What did you think of the set?
00:31:31.625,00:31:33.291,I thought it was incredible.
00:31:33.333,00:31:35.041,I didn't.
00:31:35.083,00:31:36.750,Too brown.
00:31:39.542,00:31:40.750,Mary.
00:31:42.709,00:31:44.166,"Oh, no."
00:31:45.166,00:31:46.625,She's gone.
00:32:02.208,00:32:05.500,Two girls in earlier tonight.
00:32:05.542,00:32:08.500,The other one like a sort of nice prostitute.
00:32:08.542,00:32:10.291,Did you-- Did you get their names?
00:32:10.333,00:32:12.542,"Oh, yes."
00:32:12.583,00:32:14.959,"Um, let's see."
00:32:15.000,00:32:20.250,"No, I'm afraid, uh, they were walk-ins, and it appears they paid by cash."
00:32:20.291,00:32:21.709,"Sorry, sir."
00:32:21.750,00:32:24.417,"Oh, that's okay."
00:32:24.458,00:32:27.834,It's just the end of my life.
00:32:48.792,00:32:51.166,"Oh, cheer up, mate."
00:32:51.208,00:32:55.208,Apparently you're living with Britain's greatest living playwright.
00:32:55.250,00:32:58.625,"I don't usually read them, obviously, but I couldn't resist this one."
00:32:58.667,00:33:03.500,Harry Chapman found guilty-- of genius.
00:33:09.875,00:33:11.625,I have to go out.
00:33:11.667,00:33:13.333,Why?
00:33:13.375,00:33:15.041,She loves Kate Moss.
00:33:58.875,00:34:00.792,"Thanks for keeping me company, Kittle."
00:34:00.834,00:34:03.709,Nothing better to do.
00:34:03.750,00:34:05.792,Dumped me.
00:34:05.834,00:34:07.625,And work?
00:34:07.667,00:34:09.333,Idiots.
00:34:09.375,00:34:11.208,Coffee?
00:34:11.250,00:34:14.625,I've only just noticed this cat in this picture.
00:34:14.667,00:34:16.542,See that cat?
00:34:16.583,00:34:19.041,It's very good.
00:34:19.083,00:34:21.000,"Oh, my God."
00:34:21.041,00:34:23.709,"Oh, my God."
00:34:24.375,00:34:26.417,It's her.
00:34:27.417,00:34:29.041,It's her.
00:34:30.709,00:34:32.959,That's her.
00:34:33.000,00:34:35.500,Ah!
00:34:35.542,00:34:37.500,"Oh, fuck."
00:34:37.542,00:34:39.458,"You go, girl."
00:34:50.834,00:34:52.333,Sorry.
00:34:53.041,00:34:55.125,Hi.
00:34:57.000,00:34:59.208,How are you?
00:34:59.250,00:35:01.667,"Uh, I'm-I'm fine."
00:35:01.709,00:35:05.917,It's so good to see you.
00:35:07.458,00:35:09.500,"Oh, no. Fuck."
00:35:09.542,00:35:11.250,Yeah.
00:35:11.291,00:35:13.041,No.
00:35:13.083,00:35:15.792,I think you've mistaken me for someone else.
00:35:15.834,00:35:19.041,"Um, you're-- Uh, your name is Mary."
00:35:20.792,00:35:23.375,"That's, um, distinctly weird."
00:35:23.417,00:35:25.625,How do you know that?
00:35:25.667,00:35:28.333,"Um, well, you look like a Mary."
00:35:28.375,00:35:31.458,In what way?
00:35:31.500,00:35:33.083,I look like your mother?
00:35:33.125,00:35:35.542,No. You're much prettier.
00:35:39.291,00:35:43.333,"It's a nice fringe, by the way."
00:35:39.291,00:35:47.083,"Oh, God, it's new and probably too short, but, um-- No."
00:35:43.375,00:35:49.250,"Uh, well, gee, thank you, and, uh, um, listen, it was really nice to meet you."
00:35:49.291,00:35:55.709,"Uh, I should probably go, because my friend's waiting for me, and, um-- Okay. No-- You're a-- You're a total stranger."
00:35:55.750,00:35:57.667,Total stranger.
00:35:57.709,00:36:00.166,Okay.
00:36:00.208,00:36:02.291,"Okay. Bye, Mary."
00:36:05.500,00:36:07.166,"Oh, no."
00:36:07.208,00:36:08.959,No. It was very poor.
00:36:09.000,00:36:10.542,Very poor?
00:36:10.583,00:36:13.000,You gotta go again.
00:36:13.041,00:36:14.667,You can do it.
00:36:18.166,00:36:21.542,A bit-- She just always-- She just-- She always looks different.
00:36:21.583,00:36:25.667,She needs a big-- Hi. Sorry.
00:36:25.709,00:36:28.041,Hi.
00:36:28.083,00:36:32.000,"Joanna, this is-- Tim."
00:36:32.041,00:36:33.583,Nice to meet you.
00:36:33.625,00:36:35.417,Hi. Mary.
00:36:35.458,00:36:39.792,"Uh, Tim is a total stranger whose mother's name is Mary."
00:36:39.834,00:36:44.375,Yeah. I-- I just had a weird experience with Mary here of thinking she was someone else.
00:36:44.417,00:36:49.542,But she wasn't.
00:36:49.583,00:36:59.208,"for a while, bec-- well, because my sister Kit Kat is about to leave-- Yeah. Um-- Bye."
00:36:57.542,00:37:01.166,And-- Bye.
00:37:02.667,00:37:04.500,I'm-I'm about to be quite lonely.
00:37:04.542,00:37:06.583,Right.
00:37:06.625,00:37:09.625,"Well, I think we should probably say no."
00:37:09.667,00:37:11.667,"Oh, no, yes."
00:37:09.667,00:37:14.709,"But on the other hand, he's got a quite nice smile and sort of, you know, fun hair."
00:37:16.625,00:37:19.166,Yeah.
00:37:20.625,00:37:22.542,But you have to promise that you are not...
00:37:22.583,00:37:26.917,"one of the following things-- One, a lunatic."
00:37:26.959,00:37:30.166,- No.
00:37:30.208,00:37:33.667,I'm just Kate Moss's number one male fan.
00:37:35.458,00:37:37.166,"Oh, God."
00:37:37.208,00:37:39.417,"Yeah. God, yeah."
00:37:39.458,00:37:43.166,Do you agree that the magic of her lies in her history?
00:37:43.208,00:37:45.125,That the informality of her early shots...
00:37:45.166,00:37:53.667,"compared to this stuff, so you just always know that, despite the high fashion, she's still just that cheeky, normal, naked girl on the beach?"
00:37:55.625,00:37:58.917,Couldn't have put it better myself.
00:37:58.959,00:38:01.792,I agree with that profoundly.
00:38:01.834,00:38:04.083,Milk?
00:38:04.125,00:38:05.542,Sugar?
00:38:05.583,00:38:07.125,No.
00:38:07.166,00:38:09.500,Yes!
00:38:09.542,00:38:12.208,"No, you don't have a boyfriend."
00:38:12.250,00:38:14.417,Do I not look like I'd have a boyfriend?
00:38:14.458,00:38:16.417,Do I look like I'd never get a boyfriend?
00:38:16.458,00:38:18.375,No. That's the rudest thing I've ever heard.
00:38:18.417,00:38:22.291,No. I-I didn't mean it like that.
00:38:18.417,00:38:24.375,I just didn't expect-- Is-- Is it quite a new boyfriend?
00:38:24.417,00:38:25.959,Yes.
00:38:26.000,00:38:27.792,There he is.
00:38:28.625,00:38:30.291,"Oh, yes."
00:38:30.333,00:38:32.583,He's so cute.
00:38:32.625,00:38:35.792,Sorry I'm late.
00:38:35.834,00:38:37.917,"Hi, Rupee."
00:38:37.959,00:38:39.709,Rupee?
00:38:39.750,00:38:43.041,"- Uh, well, this is Tim, and-- - Hi."
00:38:43.083,00:38:45.000,Hi.
00:38:45.041,00:38:48.375,"Hey, I was thinking we could take in a film after this."
00:38:48.417,00:38:50.792,"Get some mixed popcorn, share a Coke, snuggle."
00:38:50.834,00:38:53.000,Okay.
00:38:53.041,00:38:56.417,"When did you two meet, exactly?"
00:38:56.458,00:38:59.000,"Well, it was-- it was only a week ago, actually."
00:38:59.041,00:39:02.792,"It's all been a bit of a whirlwind, hasn't it, poochy face?"
00:39:02.834,00:39:05.917,"Well, I'm gonna have to teach you what you can and can't say in front of people."
00:39:05.959,00:39:07.542,- No poochy face?
00:39:07.583,00:39:09.750,No. Definitely not.
00:39:09.792,00:39:13.500,Come on. Come on then.
00:39:13.542,00:39:17.083,Okay. Okay.
00:39:17.125,00:39:19.500,"- Uh, oh, June 17."
00:39:19.542,00:39:22.417,"- And, uh, Jo was having a little party."
00:39:22.458,00:39:24.583,"A living hell from which Rupert, thank God, rescued me."
00:39:24.625,00:39:27.291,And where-- where was this terrible party?
00:39:27.333,00:39:29.500,"Oh, my brothel of a flat."
00:39:29.542,00:39:31.583,Which is where though?
00:39:31.625,00:39:34.041,"- What are you, a detective?"
00:39:34.083,00:39:35.917,I've just got a very visual imagination.
00:39:35.959,00:39:38.625,I like to imagine stuff completely.
00:39:38.667,00:39:41.583,"26 Courtfield Gardens, SW5."
00:39:41.625,00:39:43.208,Around 8:30.
00:39:43.250,00:39:45.917,"Um, dress code, slutty."
00:39:45.959,00:39:49.000,"Absolutely, yes."
00:39:49.041,00:39:50.709,"Early, late?"
00:39:50.750,00:39:54.166,"On time, I think."
00:39:54.208,00:39:56.542,"Oh, God."
00:39:56.583,00:40:00.000,I-I actually feel a bit sick now.
00:40:00.041,00:40:01.959,Never trust a blueberry.
00:40:02.000,00:40:03.792,"Um, okay, I'll be back in a tick."
00:40:05.458,00:40:07.166,You two are such a lovely couple.
00:40:09.291,00:40:10.250,Oh.
00:40:11.709,00:40:14.333,Bit weird.
00:40:14.375,00:40:16.291,I like him.
00:40:47.834,00:40:50.125,"Oh, hello."
00:40:50.166,00:40:53.959,"Um, no, no, no."
00:40:54.000,00:40:55.917,She has another friend?
00:40:55.959,00:40:59.542,"Gosh, you amaze me."
00:40:59.583,00:41:01.500,Yeah.
00:41:01.542,00:41:04.125,Thanks.
00:41:04.166,00:41:06.875,Disgusting.
00:41:06.917,00:41:09.000,See you later.
00:41:09.041,00:41:11.583,Yeah? How's that working out?
00:41:11.625,00:41:15.041,Wicked. Nice. Yeah.
00:41:32.792,00:41:34.417,Hi.
00:41:34.458,00:41:35.458,I'm Tim.
00:41:36.709,00:41:39.041,- Mary.
00:41:39.083,00:41:44.166,But let's not get into that.
00:41:44.208,00:41:47.917,your face tells me that you're finding this party to be a living hell.
00:41:47.959,00:41:55.208,"So, I just wondered if you might come and have a bite to eat with me instead?"
00:41:55.250,00:41:57.125,Right now.
00:41:57.166,00:42:00.458,I-I'm sorry?
00:42:00.500,00:42:03.500,"Um, let's talk about Kate Moss."
00:42:05.583,00:42:07.875,I... love Kate Moss.
00:42:07.917,00:42:10.709,I always think the key thing with her is the history.
00:42:10.750,00:42:12.959,Yes.
00:42:13.000,00:42:17.458,"compared to high fashion stuff, so you always know that underneath..."
00:42:17.500,00:42:22.000,"she's still just the same cheeky, normal girl naked on the beach."
00:42:22.041,00:42:23.667,The beach.
00:42:23.709,00:42:26.709,I agree with you completely.
00:42:26.750,00:42:29.625,"If we leave now, then we can have, you know, more than one starter."
00:42:29.667,00:42:31.250,Oh.
00:42:34.875,00:42:36.458,I love your eyes.
00:42:38.500,00:42:42.375,And I love the rest of your face too.
00:42:51.792,00:42:55.125,- More than one starter?
00:42:56.291,00:42:58.750,After you.
00:42:58.792,00:43:00.875,"Ten minutes is long enough for any party, I think."
00:43:00.917,00:43:02.917,Yeah.
00:43:02.959,00:43:05.083,Especially that one.
00:43:05.125,00:43:07.750,God.
00:43:09.250,00:43:11.375,Yeah. Ew.
00:43:13.291,00:43:16.250,"So, what do you do?"
00:43:16.291,00:43:19.500,"Um, I'm a reader at a publisher."
00:43:19.542,00:43:22.125,No. You read for a living?
00:43:23.000,00:43:25.375,Yes. That's it.
00:43:25.417,00:43:27.542,I read.
00:43:27.583,00:43:29.834,"It's like someone asking, What do you do for a living?"
00:43:29.875,00:43:31.834,"I-- Well, I breathe."
00:43:31.875,00:43:35.291,I'm a breather.
00:43:35.333,00:43:38.709,How did you get that job?
00:43:40.041,00:43:43.291,I am a lawyer.
00:43:43.333,00:43:45.417,That's sexy.
00:43:45.458,00:43:48.583,Is it?
00:43:48.625,00:43:53.959,"In a suit, in a court, saving people's lives."
00:43:54.000,00:43:56.208,I guess it is.
00:43:56.250,00:44:00.041,"Sitting there in an office, in a little chair, reading."
00:44:00.083,00:44:02.834,Ooh.
00:44:00.083,00:44:05.709,"Stop. Just wait right there, mister, because, you know, a lot of books get submitted to my publisher."
00:44:05.750,00:44:09.166,So it's an immense responsibility.
00:44:09.208,00:44:15.208,But when you do normal reading-- Is it ruined because it's your job?
00:44:12.250,00:44:18.875,"You know, like prostitutes-- I always worry that when they stop being prostitutes that they can't enjoy sex anymore."
00:44:18.917,00:44:22.000,You always worry about that?
00:44:22.041,00:44:25.750,"Oh, good. Okay. Because someone who always worried about that would be a bit of a worry."
00:44:25.792,00:44:28.208,"When you read a newspaper, do you think, Forget this. It's work?"
00:44:28.250,00:44:30.583,Have you interviewed a lot of prostitutes to ease your worries?
00:44:30.625,00:44:34.875,"When you read a menu, do you think, No, I'm not reading this unless you pay me hard cash?"
00:44:34.917,00:44:38.750,How many prostitutes will you need to talk to before this issue is solved?
00:44:38.792,00:44:42.417,"I mean, are you planning to head to Eastern Europe and Thailand?"
00:44:56.917,00:45:00.583,"Um, would you like to walk me to my car?"
00:45:00.625,00:45:02.000,Yes.
00:45:02.041,00:45:03.583,Why not?
00:45:03.625,00:45:06.083,Sounds like a good idea.
00:45:06.125,00:45:10.583,What about you?
00:45:10.625,00:45:12.375,"Oh, God."
00:45:12.417,00:45:15.375,Where are they?
00:45:15.417,00:45:17.291,Behind you.
00:45:19.750,00:45:23.291,"around the corner, and then it's-- Yeah. I know."
00:45:26.375,00:45:28.750,Did you have trouble parking?
00:45:28.792,00:45:31.542,Pardon?
00:45:31.583,00:45:33.792,It's just such a long way to your car.
00:45:33.834,00:45:36.583,"Oh, yeah, well, my car's actually parked outside my house."
00:45:36.625,00:45:38.458,I got a lift to the party.
00:45:41.125,00:45:42.542,Okay.
00:45:44.083,00:45:46.250,That's good.
00:45:46.291,00:45:47.709,Okay.
00:45:52.041,00:45:54.333,And here we are.
00:45:54.375,00:45:56.500,My God.
00:45:56.542,00:45:58.458,"Car, house."
00:45:58.500,00:46:00.125,"House, car."
00:46:02.166,00:46:04.583,- It makes perfect sense.
00:46:04.625,00:46:06.500,It's very logical.
00:46:27.125,00:46:29.000,Christ.
00:46:30.750,00:46:36.125,"Um-- Um, keys."
00:46:48.834,00:46:54.709,"Um, I'm gonna go into the bedroom and put on my new pajamas."
00:46:54.750,00:46:57.208,Right.
00:46:57.250,00:47:00.458,And then in a minute you can come in and take them off.
00:47:01.208,00:47:03.125,If you want to.
00:47:13.166,00:47:15.041,One minute.
00:47:19.375,00:47:20.667,Hi.
00:47:23.625,00:47:25.542,"Oh, are you-- - Oh."
00:47:25.583,00:47:26.875,Sorry.
00:47:26.917,00:47:28.583,Yeah.
00:47:30.417,00:47:32.583,Sorry.
00:47:56.625,00:47:59.458,"Oh, it's-- it's a front opener."
00:47:59.500,00:48:02.583,It's a what?
00:48:03.959,00:48:06.208,"Yeah. No. Yeah, of course."
00:48:06.250,00:48:07.875,Thanks.
00:48:09.834,00:48:11.875,"Ooh. Oh, well done."
00:48:20.333,00:48:22.333,I'm sure it'll be better next time.
00:48:24.000,00:48:27.417,"Why, I thought it was pretty lovely."
00:48:27.458,00:48:29.959,"Right, no, it was really lovely."
00:48:32.166,00:48:34.709,"In fact, can you just give me one minute?"
00:48:36.166,00:48:37.542,Okay.
00:48:43.166,00:48:44.417,Hi.
00:48:46.917,00:48:48.083,Dangerous.
00:48:51.792,00:48:54.500,Oh. You really know your bras.
00:48:55.625,00:48:57.583,I like to think so.
00:49:01.542,00:49:03.583,Well done.
00:49:03.625,00:49:05.792,Some people make a real mess of it the first time.
00:49:05.834,00:49:07.917,Amateurs.
00:49:10.250,00:49:13.041,Could you give me one second?
00:49:13.083,00:49:15.333,- Sure.
00:49:15.375,00:49:16.959,- I couldn't wait.
00:49:17.000,00:49:18.917,Oh.
00:49:18.959,00:49:21.208,- My... goodness.
00:49:26.083,00:49:29.834,Best night of my entire life.
00:49:29.875,00:49:35.041,And now I've got a suspicion I'm gonna have the best sleep of my entire life.
00:49:35.083,00:49:40.000,"Oh, so once is enough for my perfect guy?"
00:49:40.041,00:49:42.792,I'm not sure that's entirely fair.
00:49:48.291,00:49:49.500,Okay.
00:49:49.542,00:49:50.583,"No, we're not."
00:49:50.625,00:49:52.917,Okay.
00:49:52.959,00:49:54.458,It's all right.
00:49:55.333,00:49:56.458,Okay.
00:50:05.667,00:50:06.583,Bye.
00:50:15.667,00:50:17.917,"Oh, we're in trouble then."
00:50:20.583,00:50:23.125,Ah!
00:50:23.166,00:50:26.166,I'm taking you home.
00:50:30.625,00:50:32.583,"Okay, bye. Bye."
00:50:32.625,00:50:35.250,"No, no, no, no. No!"
00:50:37.917,00:50:39.792,...want a chocolate lab either.
00:50:39.834,00:50:40.917,Okay.
00:51:21.083,00:51:23.375,Okay. I have some bad news.
00:51:23.417,00:51:25.000,You're dying?
00:51:25.041,00:51:26.166,"No, not that bad."
00:51:26.208,00:51:28.291,I'm dying?
00:51:28.333,00:51:32.041,My parents are in town.
00:51:32.083,00:51:34.917,"Oh, God. Parents?"
00:51:34.959,00:51:36.667,- When?
00:51:36.709,00:51:41.625,"Yeah, they told me, and I didn't tell you, and I thought they'd cancel, 'cause they normally do, and they didn't."
00:51:41.667,00:51:43.542,- Now now?
00:51:43.583,00:51:45.917,So you should probably put on some pants.
00:51:45.959,00:51:47.959,Oh. God.
00:51:48.041,00:51:49.125,Okay.
00:51:49.166,00:51:51.250,Um-- I'm sorry.
00:51:51.291,00:51:53.208,"Uh, do-do-do they know I exist?"
00:51:53.250,00:51:57.375,"Uh, yeah. I've mentioned something like you, but nothing very specific."
00:51:57.417,00:52:00.959,"Um, oh, yeah."
00:52:01.000,00:52:02.792,Oh.
00:52:02.834,00:52:05.000,Okay. Yeah.
00:52:05.041,00:52:06.208,Oh.
00:52:06.250,00:52:07.750,"Oh, God. Okay."
00:52:07.792,00:52:13.000,"Um-- Could you just, um, stall them? Stall them."
00:52:15.083,00:52:17.667,"Uh, come on up."
00:52:17.709,00:52:20.083,What?
00:52:20.125,00:52:22.041,Okay.
00:52:22.083,00:52:23.792,"Uh, definitely not."
00:52:23.834,00:52:26.000,"Okay. Um, uh, are we having sex? Zip."
00:52:26.041,00:52:28.000,"Uh, yeah."
00:52:28.041,00:52:30.417,I wasn't gonna mention oral.
00:52:30.458,00:52:32.625,How did you think that was gonna come up?
00:52:32.667,00:52:34.500,"Could you help me with this, please?"
00:52:34.542,00:52:37.375,I don't know.
00:52:37.417,00:52:39.458,"Well, who's gonna bring it up?"
00:52:39.500,00:52:41.792,"Tim, had any cunnilingus with my daughter recently?"
00:52:41.834,00:52:43.542,"Well, you never know."
00:52:43.583,00:52:45.291,Okay.
00:52:45.333,00:52:46.375,Okay.
00:52:46.417,00:52:47.834,Ready?
00:52:47.875,00:52:49.250,They're there.
00:52:49.291,00:52:50.792,"Yeah. Ooh, they are. Yeah."
00:52:50.834,00:52:52.291,"Yeah, right behind you."
00:52:55.959,00:52:57.792,Dad!
00:52:57.834,00:52:59.875,Mom.
00:52:59.917,00:53:02.583,"Oh, uh, this is Tim."
00:53:02.625,00:53:04.750,"Hello, sir, ma'am."
00:53:04.792,00:53:06.500,Hi.
00:53:04.792,00:53:14.125,"Oh, should we, uh, come back when you haven't got any company, or-- Oh, well, that would be, uh, quite difficult, because Tim actually, uh, lives here."
00:53:15.542,00:53:17.750,Really?
00:53:17.792,00:53:19.375,Yes.
00:53:19.417,00:53:21.667,"Yeah, but no oral sex, I promise you."
00:53:23.625,00:53:25.000,I beg your pardon?
00:53:26.166,00:53:27.709,Excuse me.
00:53:29.250,00:53:33.417,"So, Tim, tell us, where are you from, which part of the country?"
00:53:33.458,00:53:36.250,He's from Cornwall.
00:53:36.291,00:53:39.417,"It's, um-- It's that little bit right at the end, sort of looks like a shoe."
00:53:39.458,00:53:42.000,"- And you're a lawyer, is that right?"
00:53:42.041,00:53:45.125,Yep. Yep. That's right.
00:53:45.166,00:53:49.625,"You don't think he's gonna win, and then he just pulls something out of the bag, and wouldn't you know, he wins again."
00:53:49.667,00:53:52.750,Do you ever answer any of your own questions?
00:53:54.875,00:53:56.583,"I-I-- Yes, he does."
00:53:56.625,00:54:05.500,"Usually he does, but not today, because I'm doing all the talking, because I'm really nervous, and I-- I kind of love him, and I-- I just-- I want-- I want you to too."
00:54:05.542,00:54:07.083,"Oh, honey."
00:54:07.125,00:54:09.125,"Sorry, Tim."
00:54:09.166,00:54:12.625,Over to you. Shoot.
00:54:12.667,00:54:14.959,"Uh, yeah. I think my dad-- Can I just say one more thing?"
00:54:15.000,00:54:16.667,Yeah. Yeah.
00:54:15.000,00:54:19.500,Um-- Thank God that's over.
00:54:19.542,00:54:22.250,I got given two tickets for the National Theatre tomorrow.
00:54:22.291,00:54:25.500,Do you wanna come?
00:54:25.542,00:54:28.041,I'm just gonna sleep all day.
00:54:28.083,00:54:31.083,I don't see why going to the theater should get in the way of that.
00:54:31.125,00:54:33.792,Many of the best sleeps of my life have happened in the Royal Shakespeare Company.
00:54:33.834,00:54:36.208,No.
00:54:36.250,00:54:41.500,You take someone else.
00:54:41.542,00:54:44.375,Quite right.
00:54:44.417,00:54:47.125,But what kind of sad act is gonna be free on a Saturday night...
00:54:48.333,00:54:50.458,with no days notice?
00:54:50.500,00:54:52.583,Whoo-hoo!
00:54:55.542,00:54:57.750,"Oh, my God."
00:54:57.792,00:55:00.250,My first love.
00:55:00.291,00:55:02.709,There.
00:55:02.750,00:55:05.750,"- No, not the old woman."
00:55:05.792,00:55:08.750,The one with the dark hair?
00:55:08.792,00:55:11.625,Off the stage.
00:55:11.667,00:55:14.500,Okay. You stay there.
00:55:26.333,00:55:28.375,Charlotte.
00:55:28.417,00:55:31.208,"Oh, my God. Tim."
00:55:31.250,00:55:33.583,"Oh, how fabulous to see you."
00:55:33.625,00:55:37.875,Wow. I-- This is my girlfriend Tina.
00:55:37.917,00:55:39.667,No. Oh.
00:55:41.166,00:55:43.792,That is so brilliant.
00:55:43.834,00:55:46.166,- Why is it brilliant?
00:55:43.834,00:55:48.625,"- Uh, well, you know, there are certain moments in your life that scar you for life."
00:55:48.667,00:55:51.500,"Charlotte's rejection of me was one of those moments, but..."
00:55:51.542,00:55:57.083,"now I know she's got a girlfriend, well, that's just a huge burden suddenly lifted off my mind."
00:55:57.125,00:55:59.750,I-- I can be a confident heterosexual all over again.
00:56:01.583,00:56:05.000,Not that kind of girlfriend.
00:56:05.792,00:56:07.375,What?
00:56:07.417,00:56:09.000,You think I'm gay?
00:56:10.291,00:56:11.667,No.
00:56:11.709,00:56:16.250,"No, of course not. No."
00:56:16.291,00:56:17.792,No. Wow.
00:56:17.834,00:56:21.125,"Yeah, a friend who is a girl, which you so clearly are."
00:56:21.166,00:56:24.792,"I'm just gonna go and get my, uh, boyfriend, who is a boy."
00:56:31.417,00:56:33.291,"Oh, my God. Tim."
00:56:33.333,00:56:35.291,"- Oh, how lovely to see you."
00:56:35.333,00:56:37.083,Look at you. Wow.
00:56:37.125,00:56:39.583,This is my girlfriend Tina.
00:56:39.625,00:56:41.417,"Hello, Tina."
00:56:41.458,00:56:43.917,"Although you should be a little careful with that, by the way."
00:56:43.959,00:56:47.125,"Uh, there are still quite a lot of us old-fashioned types about..."
00:56:47.166,00:56:49.542,"who, uh, interpret girlfriend as meaning gay."
00:56:49.583,00:56:53.667,"So if you say that Tina's your girlfriend, people will assume that you're gay."
00:56:53.709,00:56:55.834,I am gay.
00:56:55.875,00:56:57.291,Are you?
00:56:57.333,00:56:59.291,Do you have a problem with that?
00:56:59.333,00:57:02.291,"No, I don't."
00:57:02.333,00:57:08.667,I'm just gonna-- Wow.
00:57:08.709,00:57:11.291,I've just seen the girl who broke my heart three summers ago.
00:57:11.333,00:57:12.792,Let's go say hello.
00:57:12.834,00:57:15.375,Best let sleeping dogs lie.
00:57:15.417,00:57:17.834,Best night of my life.
00:57:17.875,00:57:20.417,"It's so bustling, and, I mean, those pictures full of color."
00:57:20.458,00:57:24.125,"Just makes me so happy when I'm round here, all the colors-- - Tim?"
00:57:24.166,00:57:26.041,Tim! How lovely to see you.
00:57:26.083,00:57:27.959,What a surprise.
00:57:28.000,00:57:29.375,Wow.
00:57:29.417,00:57:31.709,"Sorry. This, um-- This is my girlfriend Tina."
00:57:31.750,00:57:33.917,"- Shut up. Uh, yeah."
00:57:33.959,00:57:36.083,Look at you.
00:57:36.125,00:57:40.417,It would just never even occur to me you existed outside of Cornwall.
00:57:40.458,00:57:44.792,"Um, we're about to go get dinner, but it'd be great to hang out sometime."
00:57:44.834,00:57:46.458,"Yeah, sure."
00:57:46.500,00:57:48.709,"Oh, and send my love to little Kit Kat."
00:57:48.750,00:57:52.333,"Uh, she's okay."
00:57:52.375,00:57:55.000,Right. Right.
00:57:55.041,00:57:56.792,Really? Since when?
00:57:56.834,00:57:58.834,You knew there was always something there.
00:57:58.875,00:58:01.000,"Sorry. Um, you are?"
00:58:01.041,00:58:02.834,"Very well, thank you."
00:58:02.875,00:58:04.667,"Oh, Roger."
00:58:04.709,00:58:07.000,"No, it's-- it's not-- It's-- It's Rory."
00:58:07.041,00:58:09.041,"Nice to meet you, Rory."
00:58:09.083,00:58:11.083,"Um, right, sorry, we should get going."
00:58:11.125,00:58:13.125,"- Uh, it was really great to see you."
00:58:13.166,00:58:15.542,I'll see you soon.
00:58:16.417,00:58:18.125,"God, she is beautiful."
00:58:18.166,00:58:20.083,Very weird.
00:58:18.166,00:58:23.375,"I think we should go to that-- She's so beautiful, if you had sex with her, you'd die. You'd just die."
00:58:23.417,00:58:26.792,"You'd open her shirt, you'd see her breasts, and your eyes would explode."
00:58:26.834,00:58:29.291,You'd have to have sex with her blind.
00:58:29.333,00:58:35.083,"Well, you notice she didn't give me her number. That's-- Tim. I, um-- I told Tina to go have dinner on her own."
00:58:35.125,00:58:37.834,Are you hungry?
00:58:37.875,00:58:40.291,"Great. Bye, Roger."
00:58:40.333,00:58:42.583,"Oh, yeah, excellent."
00:58:42.625,00:58:44.583,Thanks again for the play.
00:58:44.625,00:58:47.875,- Where do you wanna go?
00:58:47.917,00:58:50.542,I can't compete.
00:59:02.458,00:59:07.041,"You know, I'm starting to think we slightly wasted that summer holiday."
00:59:08.208,00:59:13.417,"If we could travel back in time, maybe I wouldn't have said no."
00:59:15.625,00:59:19.041,"I'm, um-- I'm just staying round the corner."
00:59:19.083,00:59:20.709,Can you walk me home?
00:59:22.500,00:59:24.166,Yeah.
00:59:24.208,00:59:26.500,Yeah?
00:59:35.917,00:59:38.917,"Well, here we are."
00:59:43.792,00:59:47.959,It's a lot nicer... inside.
00:59:48.000,00:59:50.625,I'm sure it is.
00:59:55.917,01:00:06.667,"So-- So-- Um, so-- S-- So... lovely..."
01:00:06.709,01:00:09.041,"to see you, Charlotte."
01:00:09.083,01:00:11.166,What a night.
01:00:09.083,01:00:19.291,"Um, total joy, but I-- I've gotta get back, because there's something very important that I have to do, right now."
01:00:52.709,01:00:54.250,Wake up.
01:00:54.291,01:00:56.041,Wake up.
01:00:56.083,01:00:58.500,Mary.
01:00:58.542,01:01:01.875,Would you like...
01:01:01.917,01:01:04.583,Don't be so selfish.
01:01:04.625,01:01:06.417,It's bad.
01:01:06.458,01:01:08.875,Oh. Right.
01:01:09.834,01:01:11.750,That went very well.
01:01:19.166,01:01:20.625,Wake up.
01:01:20.667,01:01:23.083,Hmm?
01:01:23.125,01:01:25.542,Wake up.
01:01:25.583,01:01:27.583,Why?
01:01:27.625,01:01:30.250,I've got something important to ask you.
01:01:32.875,01:01:35.166,Can't it wait till morning?
01:01:35.208,01:01:36.875,Not really.
01:01:38.000,01:01:41.291,But I'm so comfy.
01:01:41.333,01:01:44.709,I was having the loveliest dream.
01:01:44.750,01:01:47.083,What is it?
01:01:47.125,01:01:50.125,Why is there music on?
01:01:50.166,01:01:52.709,It's got something to do with what I want to ask you.
01:01:54.291,01:01:56.917,Wait a minute.
01:01:56.959,01:02:00.375,Romantic music.
01:02:00.417,01:02:03.166,Guy with important question.
01:02:03.208,01:02:05.250,- Are you on your knees?
01:02:05.291,01:02:08.959,On his knees.
01:02:09.000,01:02:11.000,Were you so bored in the play...
01:02:11.041,01:02:14.583,you decided to ask me to marry you afterwards?
01:02:15.917,01:02:19.250,Huh?
01:02:21.917,01:02:25.291,Yeah.
01:02:25.333,01:02:31.417,"In fact, will you marry me?"
01:02:38.000,01:02:40.667,Any thoughts on the answer?
01:02:40.709,01:02:45.000,Yes? No?
01:02:48.375,01:02:53.959,I think I'll go for-- Yes.
01:02:59.166,01:03:01.792,Thank you for asking me.
01:03:01.834,01:03:06.875,And thank you for not going for one of those melodramatic proposals...
01:03:06.917,01:03:09.542,with lots of people around.
01:03:09.583,01:03:12.000,I hate other people.
01:03:12.041,01:03:14.875,Me too.
01:03:16.709,01:03:19.250,I'm just gonna turn off the radio.
01:03:19.291,01:03:21.333,Okay.
01:03:23.291,01:03:29.250,- Shh! Shh!
01:03:29.291,01:03:30.917,"Thanks, guys."
01:03:30.959,01:03:32.542,"Sorry, she's a bit tired."
01:03:32.583,01:03:37.208,But we really appreciate it.
01:03:45.542,01:03:48.458,"Um, here."
01:03:48.500,01:03:52.959,- That's so beautiful.
01:03:53.000,01:03:56.792,"- Oh, really?"
01:03:56.834,01:03:58.166,No? No.
01:03:58.208,01:04:01.000,- Hello.
01:04:01.041,01:04:02.458,Mary!
01:04:02.500,01:04:04.041,"Good Lord, you're pretty."
01:04:04.083,01:04:06.417,"Oh, no, I-- It's just..."
01:04:06.458,01:04:09.041,I've got a lot of mascara and lipstick on.
01:04:09.083,01:04:13.083,Let's have a look.
01:04:13.125,01:04:17.375,It's very bad for a girl to be too pretty.
01:04:17.417,01:04:20.875,It stops her developing a sense of humor.
01:04:20.917,01:04:23.750,Tea?
01:04:23.792,01:04:26.667,I'd love a cup of tea.
01:04:26.709,01:04:28.417,You get a saucer.
01:04:28.458,01:04:30.375,"That's very, very-- Cup without the crack."
01:04:30.417,01:04:32.083,"Oh, skipping stones."
01:04:32.125,01:04:34.875,They've been doing this since he was about this high.
01:04:34.917,01:04:38.375,And what are your faults?
01:04:38.417,01:04:47.041,"Oh, uh-- I-- Uh-- Well, I'm very insecure."
01:04:47.083,01:04:48.625,Sweet.
01:04:48.667,01:04:50.417,Okay.
01:04:50.458,01:04:53.875,"I, um-- I've a very bad temper sometimes."
01:04:53.917,01:04:57.375,Crucial.
01:04:59.750,01:05:05.667,"Oh, and, of course, I have, um-- I have a weakness for your son."
01:05:05.709,01:05:10.834,But best not to tell him.
01:05:10.875,01:05:14.542,Pow.
01:05:14.583,01:05:18.667,I'm so good without the ball.
01:05:18.709,01:05:21.500,- What do you think of her?
01:05:24.125,01:05:28.333,"Oh, look, I'd forgotten this."
01:05:28.375,01:05:32.083,Greatest record ever recorded by an Italian who looks like he's got a dead badger on his head.
01:05:32.125,01:05:34.792,And you've got the album.
01:05:34.834,01:05:38.875,- Check out those specs!
01:05:38.917,01:05:42.709,Come on. On with the game!
01:05:42.750,01:05:44.875,And what an extraordinary game this is.
01:05:44.917,01:05:50.375,"For the first time, a father and son are playing each other in the World Table Tennis Final, and neither of them are Chinese."
01:05:50.417,01:05:57.959,"Tremendous play from the old world champion and his son, the first openly ginger British table tennis player, but there are signs the youngster's beginning to crack."
01:05:58.000,01:05:59.792,- There are tears in his eyes.
01:05:59.834,01:06:02.792,There soon will be!
01:06:02.834,01:06:04.709,"Ha, ha, ha!"
01:06:06.375,01:06:08.792,Hey.
01:06:08.834,01:06:10.709,Hey!
01:06:10.750,01:06:12.750,Yeah.
01:06:12.792,01:06:15.166,I just popped down for a while.
01:06:15.208,01:06:16.709,What about the job?
01:06:16.750,01:06:18.792,Oh.
01:06:18.834,01:06:21.959,So how long have you been here?
01:06:22.000,01:06:24.125,Gosh!
01:06:22.000,01:06:27.667,"So, life in London-- Horrid."
01:06:29.166,01:06:30.667,"Um, is Mary here?"
01:06:30.709,01:06:32.625,- Yes.
01:06:32.667,01:06:37.625,"Uh, downstairs."
01:06:37.667,01:06:39.375,Be gentle!
01:06:41.250,01:06:43.542,- Ooh! Ooh!
01:06:43.583,01:06:45.792,"- Oh, careful!"
01:06:45.834,01:06:48.750,"- Yeah, nice to see you too."
01:06:48.792,01:06:50.333,I'm trying to make a good impression.
01:06:50.375,01:06:52.208,"Yeah, you make a good impression."
01:06:52.250,01:06:54.291,"Uh, right. Sorry."
01:06:54.333,01:06:57.792,"Um, sorry. I-- I've got an important announcement to make."
01:06:57.834,01:07:00.583,- Mm-hmm.
01:07:00.625,01:07:03.166,"We've decided, after a little bit of thought, to get married."
01:07:05.792,01:07:09.375,That's wonderful news!
01:07:09.417,01:07:13.500,- Who are you getting married to?
01:07:13.542,01:07:15.875,Oh!
01:07:15.917,01:07:18.834,Jolly embarrassing if it had been another girl.
01:07:18.875,01:07:21.000,We're so pleased.
01:07:21.041,01:07:22.750,"Oh. Oh, no, sorry."
01:07:22.792,01:07:27.417,"Um, yeah. Uh, by the way, the wedding will be quite soon."
01:07:27.458,01:07:29.333,"Uh, because we're-- we're having a baby too."
01:07:29.375,01:07:32.709,- What?
01:07:36.667,01:07:38.166,You're pregnant?
01:07:38.208,01:07:40.709,Ohh. Who's the father?
01:07:40.750,01:07:45.542,"- Oh. Well, Tim, I hope."
01:07:45.583,01:07:47.166,Jolly awkward if it had been another fella.
01:07:47.208,01:07:48.458,Mmm.
01:07:51.458,01:07:52.959,We have to decide tonight.
01:07:53.000,01:07:55.041,What?
01:07:55.083,01:07:58.458,"I mean, the only thing you've decided about our wedding..."
01:07:58.500,01:08:02.417,is that I'm coming down the aisle to the sound of some Italian weirdo...
01:08:02.458,01:08:04.417,singing a song called Il Mondo.
01:08:04.458,01:08:07.667,Excellent song.
01:08:07.709,01:08:09.667,So here's the deal.
01:08:09.709,01:08:12.917,I will take off one item of clothing for every decision you make.
01:08:14.333,01:08:17.250,"Okay. You have my attention, young lady."
01:08:17.291,01:08:21.500,Right. Um-- Where would you like to get married?
01:08:23.125,01:08:25.500,Home.
01:08:25.542,01:08:27.250,Okay.
01:08:27.291,01:08:29.250,"Oh, my God."
01:08:29.291,01:08:31.500,Who should the priest be?
01:08:31.542,01:08:33.959,It'll have to be the local bloke with yellow teeth and the massive unibrow.
01:08:34.000,01:08:38.208,Okay.
01:08:39.792,01:08:43.792,"- Um, best man."
01:08:43.834,01:08:47.417,- Best man. Now.
01:08:47.458,01:08:50.500,"You piss off the ones you don't pick, and you end up hating the one you do pick..."
01:08:50.542,01:08:52.542,because he makes a bad speech and ruins the day.
01:08:52.583,01:08:56.458,- Do you wanna see these puppies or not?
01:08:56.500,01:08:58.083,Jay.
01:08:58.125,01:08:59.875,"Oh, he's my best friend, but he's a moron."
01:08:59.917,01:09:01.500,Yeah. He will mess up everything.
01:09:01.542,01:09:03.083,- Rory.
01:09:03.125,01:09:05.709,"- No, Harry. Harry."
01:09:07.500,01:09:11.041,"- Yeah. Oh, R-Rory. Sorry."
01:09:11.083,01:09:13.542,"Oh! Okay, fine."
01:09:13.583,01:09:15.125,Honeymoon?
01:09:15.166,01:09:17.291,Bed and breakfast in Scotland.
01:09:17.333,01:09:19.875,I am not taking my pants off for Scotland.
01:09:19.917,01:09:22.417,But it's all we can afford.
01:09:22.458,01:09:25.500,- I will not.
01:09:25.542,01:09:28.834,I want two weeks in Bali!
01:09:35.375,01:09:37.458,Have you planned a break?
01:09:47.542,01:09:48.917,"Oh, no!"
01:09:51.625,01:09:54.792,- Is that you?
01:10:10.959,01:10:12.792,It's for you.
01:10:45.166,01:10:46.709,Oh!
01:10:46.750,01:10:48.709,"Oh, no! I'm caught!"
01:10:48.750,01:10:50.208,Help me!
01:10:54.709,01:10:56.208,Yes!
01:11:00.041,01:11:01.625,Right. Follow me.
01:11:03.875,01:11:05.417,My gosh!
01:11:07.250,01:11:09.750,"- Oh, my God!"
01:11:11.250,01:11:12.709,"Oh, God!"
01:11:12.750,01:11:16.667,I'm so happy that-- Good.
01:11:18.333,01:11:20.875,It's a joke!
01:11:24.375,01:11:25.834,Here.
01:11:30.500,01:11:33.625,"Here, come on."
01:11:50.500,01:11:52.291,Ohh!
01:12:16.834,01:12:20.875,Hello. I'm Rory.
01:12:16.834,01:12:25.709,"Um-- Wh-When Tim asked me to be his-his best man, um, I was terrified."
01:12:25.750,01:12:29.834,"So I thought, um, best thing is to find a book about speeches."
01:12:29.875,01:12:31.875,"- And, um, here it is."
01:12:31.917,01:12:35.875,"And, um, it says think of really funny anecdotes."
01:12:35.917,01:12:41.583,"Um, and there is a very hilarious story, actually, from work."
01:12:41.625,01:12:45.250,It was-- It was quite a complicated case based on an issue...
01:12:45.291,01:12:53.500,"of cross-amortization of ownership of postdivorce properties, and, um, uh-- Let me just explain the context."
01:12:50.667,01:13:04.291,"Uh, the defendant-- - When Tim asked me to do his best man speech, my immediate reaction was, uh, How much are you gonna pay me, you little shit?"
01:13:04.333,01:13:06.625,"I don't write for free, you know."
01:13:06.667,01:13:09.917,These were the girls available to him at that time.
01:13:09.959,01:13:13.125,"Hello, girls."
01:13:13.166,01:13:15.041,Let me explain the code.
01:13:15.083,01:13:18.709,"- Five, blow job."
01:13:18.750,01:13:23.500,"- Eight, full penetrative-- And so, uh, a toast..."
01:13:23.542,01:13:26.959,to the man with the worst haircut but the best bride in the room.
01:13:27.000,01:13:28.709,Yeah.
01:13:28.750,01:13:30.959,"- Ladies and gentlemen, Tim and Mary."
01:13:31.000,01:13:33.458,That's so sweet.
01:13:34.709,01:13:36.583,I wish I'd said I love you.
01:13:36.625,01:13:38.542,"You did, Dad."
01:13:38.583,01:13:40.333,It was implied.
01:13:40.375,01:13:44.291,"I'm not sure implied is good enough for a wedding day, are you?"
01:13:44.333,01:13:46.834,"No, don't."
01:13:46.875,01:13:50.875,I'm so ha-- I'm so happy with it as it was.
01:13:50.917,01:13:54.709,"I'll do what I wanna do, young man. Will you excuse me for just one moment?"
01:13:57.250,01:14:01.834,Later on I may tell you about Tim's many failings...
01:14:01.875,01:14:04.750,as a man and as a table tennis player.
01:14:04.792,01:14:08.083,But important first to say the one...
01:14:09.959,01:14:11.458,big thing.
01:14:11.500,01:14:17.041,I've only loved three men in my life.
01:14:17.083,01:14:20.834,"My dad was a frosty bugger, so that only leaves dear Uncle Desmond."
01:14:22.208,01:14:27.417,"Um, B.B. King, obviously, and this young man here."
01:14:27.458,01:14:32.917,I'd only give one piece of advice to anyone marrying.
01:14:32.959,01:14:36.208,We're all quite similar in the end.
01:14:36.250,01:14:39.667,We all get old and tell the same tales too many times.
01:14:39.709,01:14:46.000,But try and marry someone...
01:14:46.041,01:14:51.417,And this is a kind man with a good heart.
01:14:51.458,01:14:59.542,"I'm not particularly proud of many things in my life, but I am very proud..."
01:14:59.583,01:15:01.834,to be the father of my son.
01:15:05.208,01:15:09.500,"I'm so sorry to disturb you, uh, but I wonder if I could have your autograph."
01:15:09.542,01:15:11.667,No. No.
01:15:11.709,01:15:13.458,"I'm at a wedding, for God's sake."
01:15:13.500,01:15:16.709,"I'm here to celebrate true love, not..."
01:15:16.750,01:15:19.625,scribble my illegible signature on stupid bits of paper...
01:15:19.667,01:15:24.375,that you can flog on eBay so that at the next wedding you can wear a less hideous hat.
01:15:24.417,01:15:26.709,I see you've met my Aunt May.
01:15:26.750,01:15:29.041,"Oh, God."
01:15:29.083,01:15:30.417,People should wear name tags.
01:15:31.875,01:15:33.625,"You next, Kittle Kattle."
01:15:34.959,01:15:38.709,"I don't know, Uncle D."
01:15:38.750,01:15:41.333,Boys aren't very nice.
01:15:41.375,01:15:44.750,"Aren't they, darling?"
01:15:46.542,01:15:50.041,"They're always taking liberties, not giving much back in return."
01:15:53.500,01:15:55.208,Mmm?
01:15:55.250,01:15:58.083,Yeah? I like the way you say yummy.
01:16:05.709,01:16:08.750,"Do you wish we'd picked another, less wet day?"
01:16:08.792,01:16:11.291,No. No.
01:16:11.333,01:16:15.542,Not for the world.
01:16:18.750,01:16:24.875,And so it begins.
01:16:24.917,01:16:26.333,Fun!
01:16:32.166,01:16:35.125,Posy.
01:16:35.166,01:16:37.417,Posy she is.
01:16:37.458,01:16:39.750,Oh!
01:16:39.792,01:16:43.500,"Oh, yeah."
01:16:43.542,01:16:47.208,You want your daddy.
01:16:47.250,01:16:50.625,Oh.
01:16:50.667,01:16:54.750,There.
01:16:54.792,01:16:58.375,ever prepare you for what happens when you have a child.
01:16:58.417,01:17:03.583,When you see the baby in your arms and you know that it's your job now.
01:17:03.625,01:17:05.834,No one can prepare you for the love...
01:17:05.875,01:17:08.250,and the fear.
01:17:08.291,01:17:12.125,"Oh, she's lovely."
01:17:12.166,01:17:14.000,You were such an ugly baby.
01:17:14.041,01:17:16.166,More chimpanzee than child.
01:17:16.208,01:17:20.959,"- I remember the first time I saw you, I thanked God we were in driving distance of London Zoo."
01:17:23.166,01:17:25.625,Come on. Hand over the little bugger.
01:17:25.667,01:17:27.375,- Are we sure?
01:17:27.417,01:17:30.125,"Oh, look."
01:17:30.166,01:17:32.000,Look.
01:17:32.041,01:17:35.750,Sweetheart.
01:17:35.792,01:17:38.208,No one can prepare you for the love...
01:17:38.250,01:17:39.959,people you love can feel for them.
01:17:40.000,01:17:42.792,That's quite incredible.
01:17:42.834,01:17:46.000,And nothing can prepare you for the indifference of friends who don't have babies.
01:17:46.041,01:17:47.834,Do you wanna go to Uncle Jay? Huh?
01:17:47.875,01:17:49.875,Hmm? No. No.
01:17:49.917,01:17:51.583,And it's a shock how quickly...
01:17:51.625,01:17:55.458,you have to move to a new place you completely can't afford.
01:17:55.500,01:17:57.333,Look what we found.
01:17:57.375,01:17:58.875,Look who it is!
01:17:58.917,01:18:01.959,Honey.
01:18:04.417,01:18:10.959,"Suddenly, time travel seems almost unnecessary, because every detail of life is so delightful."
01:18:13.291,01:18:16.625,Thank you very much.
01:18:13.291,01:18:19.291,"If you ever wonder if I want-- Doo, doo, doo, doo."
01:18:19.333,01:18:21.875,"Horace, I think."
01:18:21.917,01:18:24.291,"Only one important thing for a godfather, I'm told."
01:18:24.333,01:18:26.917,Never bring a present smaller than the child.
01:18:26.959,01:18:31.000,"Oh, shut up, you smug bastard."
01:18:31.041,01:18:33.166,She'll never know.
01:18:33.208,01:18:35.250,"I didn't expect to see you here, Harry."
01:18:35.291,01:18:37.542,Children's party is not exactly your style.
01:18:37.583,01:18:40.834,"No, Mary. I was tricked."
01:18:40.875,01:18:42.375,Oh!
01:18:42.417,01:18:44.834,"I hate kids, as you know."
01:18:44.875,01:18:47.041,"Where-- Where's Kit Kat, by the way?"
01:18:47.083,01:18:49.583,I don't know.
01:18:49.625,01:18:52.792,And you know we got purple cupcakes for her especially.
01:18:52.834,01:18:55.125,Ooh. Ah.
01:18:55.166,01:18:57.834,Speak of the devil.
01:18:57.875,01:19:00.709,"Well-Well, we'll wait till Auntie Kit Kat gets here."
01:19:01.917,01:19:04.875,Hey.
01:19:06.333,01:19:08.375,Thought she was here.
01:19:10.959,01:19:13.291,- That's not good.
01:19:13.333,01:19:24.792,"Um-- We had an argument this morning, over nothing. But, uh, she-- she'd been drinking, so-- And then she ran out to get the car to come here and..."
01:19:24.834,01:19:31.041,"I told her to meet me here, so... she should be-- There's a song by Baz Luhrmann called Sunscreen."
01:19:31.083,01:19:33.583,He says worrying about the future...
01:19:33.625,01:19:38.208,is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum.
01:19:38.250,01:19:40.583,The real troubles in your life...
01:19:40.625,01:19:45.125,will always be things that never crossed your worried mind.
01:19:58.083,01:20:03.041,- What happened?
01:20:03.083,01:20:07.667,And... maybe I wasn't completely sober.
01:20:09.542,01:20:11.834,How is she?
01:20:11.875,01:20:14.625,When did she leave you?
01:20:14.667,01:20:16.208,Exact time.
01:20:22.458,01:20:24.291,We had an argument.
01:20:26.083,01:20:28.959,"Ah, here we are."
01:20:29.000,01:20:31.375,Come on.
01:20:31.417,01:20:34.291,"Oh, God. There she is."
01:20:34.333,01:20:37.458,Hey.
01:20:37.500,01:20:39.959,"Yes, and she's so excited."
01:20:40.000,01:20:42.375,She's downstairs.
01:20:42.417,01:20:45.000,"Happy birthday, Posy."
01:20:45.041,01:20:47.208,Oh! Oh!
01:20:47.250,01:20:49.583,I'm sorry.
01:20:49.625,01:20:54.291,I thought she was gonna drive herself.
01:20:54.333,01:20:56.333,She okay?
01:20:58.917,01:21:00.625,I'm worried about Kit Kat.
01:21:02.709,01:21:05.500,Yeah.
01:21:05.542,01:21:09.041,She was drinking wine while we were drinking tea.
01:21:09.083,01:21:11.625,And Jimmy wasn't nice to her.
01:21:11.667,01:21:14.750,And she spurned the purple cupcakes.
01:21:14.792,01:21:16.959,We have to do something to fix it.
01:21:19.875,01:21:21.875,Yeah.
01:21:21.917,01:21:30.000,"But, you know, if it's gonna be fixed, I think she probably has to do it herself."
01:21:30.041,01:21:33.291,Maybe.
01:21:37.667,01:21:40.166,My darling.
01:21:40.208,01:21:42.375,You're the best person in the world.
01:21:42.417,01:21:44.625,You're top equal with my wife.
01:21:46.583,01:21:52.291,"Maybe, just maybe, I'm the faller."
01:21:52.333,01:22:01.959,"Every family has, like, someone who falls, who-- who doesn't make the grade, who stumbles, who life trips up."
01:22:02.000,01:22:04.375,Maybe I'm our faller.
01:22:05.375,01:22:07.000,No.
01:22:07.041,01:22:08.333,No.
01:22:15.667,01:22:18.667,Okay.
01:22:18.709,01:22:21.291,And you have to promise to keep it.
01:22:21.333,01:22:22.709,We've always kept secrets.
01:22:22.750,01:22:24.250,We have?
01:22:24.291,01:22:33.000,"You promise you won't ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever tell?"
01:22:33.041,01:22:34.500,Yes.
01:22:39.917,01:22:42.166,I can travel in time.
01:22:45.500,01:22:48.083,Why are we standing in the cupboard under the stairs?
01:22:48.125,01:22:51.875,"Because we're gonna go back in time, and you're gonna do some things differently."
01:22:51.917,01:22:54.458,I love it when you're funny.
01:22:54.500,01:22:56.041,Close your eyes.
01:23:12.667,01:23:16.166,"Oh, my God."
01:23:16.208,01:23:21.208,"Oh, my assing God in a box!"
01:23:24.000,01:23:26.792,You're kidding?
01:23:26.834,01:23:30.583,"I can go anywhere in time, and you bring me back to the worst party of all time."
01:23:30.625,01:23:35.458,Afraid so.
01:23:35.500,01:23:38.000,We've got work to do.
01:23:38.041,01:23:40.875,Making sure you do not meet Jimmy Kincade.
01:23:40.917,01:23:42.291,"Quick, in here."
01:23:44.458,01:23:47.542,But he's about to fall in love with me!
01:23:57.959,01:23:59.875,"Well, who's the pretty-looking girl?"
01:23:59.917,01:24:02.333,"- It's Jennifer, isn't it?"
01:24:02.375,01:24:06.458,- Wild.
01:24:06.500,01:24:09.125,Right. I get it.
01:24:09.166,01:24:13.166,"If he hadn't met me, he would have just had sex with someone else."
01:24:13.208,01:24:15.083,"Nip it in the bud, eh?"
01:24:18.750,01:24:22.083,"- Excuse me, Jimmy."
01:24:22.125,01:24:25.625,Do-Do I know you?
01:24:25.667,01:24:28.083,Very well.
01:24:28.125,01:24:30.959,"Um, and this is what I-- what I should have done right at the start."
01:24:35.834,01:24:39.333,"Um, happy New Year, everybody."
01:24:39.375,01:24:42.125,Happy New Year. Happy New Year.
01:24:42.166,01:24:45.834,Amazing!
01:24:45.875,01:24:49.041,What happens now?
01:24:49.083,01:24:53.667,"What I'm hoping is that from this moment on you avoid the sleazy bad guys, because they're sleazy and bad."
01:24:53.709,01:24:56.500,When did you get so serious?
01:24:56.542,01:24:58.667,Since it occurred to me that I might lose you.
01:25:01.250,01:25:04.125,Brace yourself.
01:25:05.000,01:25:06.625,Things will have changed.
01:25:09.250,01:25:10.083,Come on!
01:25:13.125,01:25:14.667,"Oh, my God."
01:25:14.709,01:25:16.792,What?
01:25:16.834,01:25:18.834,"Jay, Jay?"
01:25:18.875,01:25:24.208,"And, um, he's adorable."
01:25:24.250,01:25:27.333,Right.
01:25:33.458,01:25:35.709,"Come on, you two."
01:25:35.750,01:25:38.166,Mum's just cracked open a packet of biscuits.
01:25:41.375,01:25:44.291,What do you mean it's changed?
01:25:44.333,01:25:46.834,"I've got something in mind for you. You know, don't you?"
01:25:46.875,01:25:49.041,what you're gonna say.
01:25:49.083,01:25:52.125,Yeah.
01:25:49.083,01:25:57.333,Mmm. But leave-- Leave the rest for Uncle D. I want-- It's just tidying really.
01:25:57.375,01:25:58.417,Hey.
01:25:58.458,01:26:00.166,You all right?
01:26:00.208,01:26:02.333,I missed you.
01:26:02.375,01:26:03.458,Okay.
01:26:06.083,01:26:08.667,It's a tidying up.
01:26:08.709,01:26:10.959,Here we go.
01:26:11.000,01:26:13.792,looking for. Okay? All this.
01:26:13.834,01:26:15.417,Dead stuff.
01:26:18.375,01:26:21.125,"They've torn them to shreds, haven't they?"
01:26:21.166,01:26:24.000,Very likely.
01:26:33.375,01:26:37.041,- How did everything go?
01:26:37.083,01:26:39.709,I'm so happy.
01:26:39.750,01:26:42.500,I wanna hear all about it.
01:26:42.542,01:26:45.125,Because there's something I have to do before 6:00 or I'll get fired.
01:26:45.166,01:26:48.792,Yeah. I can't think of anything I'd love to do more.
01:26:48.834,01:26:51.917,"Okay, where is the most fabulous person in the world?"
01:26:51.959,01:26:56.333,Come to your dad and get mashed-up food shoved into your mouth!
01:27:03.959,01:27:06.792,"Hello there, little boy."
01:27:09.250,01:27:13.417,"You just... wait there, and I'll be back in a minute."
01:27:25.583,01:27:29.083,"Dad, can I have a quick word?"
01:27:30.875,01:27:34.125,"- I can't go back past the birth again, can I?"
01:27:34.166,01:27:37.291,I should have mentioned that.
01:27:34.166,01:27:45.250,"You're okay till it comes out, but the exact sperm at the exact moment got you this particular baby, so if you do anything the tiniest bit different, you'll-- you'll have a different child."
01:27:47.750,01:27:52.667,"So, every day up till yesterday is as it will always be?"
01:27:52.709,01:27:58.291,- Just like for everyone else.
01:27:58.333,01:28:00.750,Tough.
01:28:25.542,01:28:27.750,Go home.
01:28:27.792,01:28:32.625,We're not leaving this room until we find a way of making sure this never happens again.
01:28:45.792,01:28:47.208,Will you go now?
01:29:00.709,01:29:03.166,"I have to leave Jimmy, don't I?"
01:29:04.125,01:29:06.458,For good.
01:29:06.500,01:29:09.417,And I have to stop drinking.
01:29:12.792,01:29:14.667,And stop leaving jobs.
01:29:16.834,01:29:21.792,And... I have to go out with someone...
01:29:21.834,01:29:24.542,nice and... boring.
01:29:27.083,01:29:29.000,Yea.
01:29:31.792,01:29:34.875,"And you know, nice isn't necessarily boring."
01:29:34.917,01:29:38.500,- Like who?
01:29:38.542,01:29:43.250,Okay. I'll go out with Matt Damon.
01:29:43.291,01:29:46.542,Tell me.
01:29:46.583,01:29:48.375,Your Jay?
01:29:48.417,01:29:51.000,"What, sticky-up hair Jay?"
01:29:51.041,01:29:53.208,Yes.
01:29:53.250,01:29:56.000,He just popped into my head.
01:29:56.041,01:29:57.917,Really?
01:30:00.250,01:30:02.750,- Weird.
01:30:02.792,01:30:05.667,- Are you free?
01:30:05.709,01:30:10.000,Might have to freshen up a bit first.
01:30:16.667,01:30:19.834,Joanna? Hey.
01:30:19.875,01:30:21.667,It's been a total nightmare.
01:30:21.709,01:30:24.041,It's all fine anyway.
01:30:24.083,01:30:26.834,It was the single worst night of my life.
01:30:26.875,01:30:28.875,Where's Posy?
01:30:28.917,01:30:31.583,There she is.
01:30:31.625,01:30:34.417,Hello!
01:30:34.458,01:30:36.542,"Darling, how are you doing?"
01:30:40.000,01:30:41.792,Let's have another one.
01:30:43.625,01:30:47.333,"Oh, screw that. No."
01:30:47.375,01:30:48.667,Oh.
01:30:48.709,01:30:51.792,"That hurt, and I got fat."
01:30:51.834,01:30:54.166,You got a little bit fat.
01:30:54.208,01:30:57.625,Tell Mummy you want a sister.
01:30:57.667,01:31:03.041,- Tell Daddy you're happy being an only child.
01:31:03.083,01:31:07.417,"Fortunately we are young and careless, and it wasn't long before there were four of us."
01:31:07.458,01:31:10.959,And this is incredible.
01:31:07.458,01:31:14.208,"Posy Lake, only three years old, is about to break the women's 10-meter Olympic record."
01:31:14.250,01:31:16.667,They're gonna do it.
01:31:16.709,01:31:18.750,Fantastic.
01:31:18.792,01:31:21.041,That was brilliant.
01:31:21.083,01:31:22.542,Sleeping right through all that.
01:31:22.583,01:31:25.291,Can you help me?
01:31:25.333,01:31:27.458,What do I wear for dinner with our best-selling author?
01:31:27.500,01:31:30.000,Let me finish up with the monsters and I'll come right up.
01:31:30.041,01:31:31.291,Right. Great.
01:31:31.333,01:31:33.333,Go again.
01:31:33.375,01:31:36.166,Okay.
01:31:36.208,01:31:38.750,That's gorgeous.
01:31:38.792,01:31:41.083,No. Take it seriously.
01:31:41.125,01:31:44.000,It's-- I don't know.
01:31:44.041,01:31:46.458,"- No, I hate it."
01:31:46.500,01:31:50.709,It's boring...
01:31:50.750,01:31:53.834,"Yeah. No, you're right."
01:31:55.792,01:31:57.750,Okay.
01:31:57.792,01:32:00.208,Gorgeous.
01:32:00.250,01:32:03.875,"No, it's too breasty."
01:32:03.917,01:32:06.250,Okay.
01:32:06.291,01:32:09.250,No. I'm not wearing these heels.
01:32:09.291,01:32:11.208,"Well, not high heels then."
01:32:11.250,01:32:12.917,But then we have the short legs problem.
01:32:12.959,01:32:15.417,"Okay. Well, do you want to look like a prostitute or a dwarf?"
01:32:15.458,01:32:18.458,Warning.
01:32:22.166,01:32:24.792,- Yes!
01:32:28.583,01:32:29.417,No!
01:32:30.500,01:32:32.709,Now that I like.
01:32:32.750,01:32:36.834,No. I-- I'm just picking up the dress that this goes under.
01:32:36.875,01:32:39.542,Such a bad boy.
01:32:39.583,01:32:42.750,- This one?
01:32:42.792,01:32:44.667,- Or this one?
01:32:44.709,01:32:47.125,- Same dress.
01:32:47.166,01:32:48.959,No?
01:32:49.041,01:32:51.417,Okay. I don't think this one's too bad.
01:32:51.458,01:32:54.417,"Yeah, it's fabulous."
01:32:54.458,01:32:56.041,- Yeah.
01:32:56.083,01:32:58.125,Mm-hmm.
01:32:58.166,01:33:01.375,Um-- How about the blue one?
01:33:01.417,01:33:02.875,Blue one.
01:33:02.917,01:33:04.792,Yeah. The first one that you tried on...
01:33:04.834,01:33:08.750,"that was boring and lumpy, but that wasn't actually boring and lumpy-- that one?"
01:33:08.792,01:33:10.750,"Yeah, which-which do you prefer?"
01:33:10.792,01:33:12.542,I don't know.
01:33:12.583,01:33:14.458,"Okay, I think I like the blue one."
01:33:14.500,01:33:16.083,Okay.
01:33:17.417,01:33:19.875,"Okay. Okay, let's go with this one then."
01:33:19.917,01:33:22.041,You look amazing.
01:33:22.083,01:33:23.208,Really?
01:33:23.250,01:33:27.333,"Okay, thanks."
01:33:27.375,01:33:29.417,Hmm.
01:33:29.458,01:33:31.625,I-I left her downstairs.
01:33:31.667,01:33:35.959,Not leaving the door open to the room with the manuscript in it?
01:33:31.667,01:33:38.709,Uh-- I-I don't think so.
01:33:38.750,01:33:41.291,Look at me.
01:33:41.333,01:33:43.125,and talk me through this.
01:33:41.333,01:33:44.834,Well-- Basically my life is over.
01:33:44.875,01:33:47.542,"I really need to go out for just, like, two minutes."
01:33:47.583,01:33:49.959,Don't you dare!
01:33:50.000,01:33:52.208,"- Okay, I'm just-- - Don't you dare answer that!"
01:33:52.250,01:33:54.208,What am I gonna do?
01:33:54.250,01:33:56.750,I think we should really answer the phone.
01:33:54.250,01:33:58.792,"If you answer the goddamn phone, I will kill you with the phone."
01:33:58.834,01:34:02.041,"I won't answer the phone, but I do-- I do need to get out."
01:33:58.834,01:34:04.583,"So, I mean-- No. No getting out."
01:34:04.625,01:34:07.500,Okay. Right.
01:34:07.542,01:34:12.750,"We read most of your book, but, you see, the rest of it was, um, colored on or..."
01:34:12.792,01:34:15.166,shredded.
01:34:15.208,01:34:16.917,Yeah.
01:34:16.959,01:34:20.291,I-- I had no idea Posy actually knew how to use that machine.
01:34:20.333,01:34:23.083,"- In a way, that's impressive."
01:34:23.125,01:34:26.333,What is it? What?
01:34:28.625,01:34:33.792,"Oh, Mary. Uh-- Uh, no, everything-- Sorry."
01:34:33.834,01:34:36.333,"Um, your son will explain."
01:34:36.375,01:34:39.166,It's your mother.
01:34:45.583,01:34:49.375,"No, no. It's okay. We'll-- We'll come straight down."
01:34:50.458,01:34:52.166,"Okay, bye-bye."
01:35:06.291,01:35:10.083,"Hello, darling."
01:35:10.125,01:35:12.792,Honestly?
01:35:12.834,01:35:16.208,I am fucking furious.
01:35:16.250,01:35:20.792,I am so... uninterested in a life without your father.
01:35:22.333,01:35:25.500,"Mary. Come on, let's make some tea."
01:35:25.542,01:35:28.583,How are you?
01:35:28.625,01:35:30.000,"Yes, of course."
01:35:36.291,01:35:38.583,Desmond.
01:35:38.625,01:35:41.625,How are you?
01:35:41.667,01:35:43.166,Though a little hot.
01:35:43.208,01:35:45.375,Hmm.
01:35:47.667,01:35:51.000,"Your father, I think, is not so well."
01:35:51.041,01:35:54.875,- Cancer.
01:35:54.917,01:35:57.208,"I'm very unhappy about it, Tim."
01:35:59.709,01:36:01.792,At your wedding he said he loved me.
01:36:01.834,01:36:03.333,He does.
01:36:05.917,01:36:08.458,That was the best day of my life.
01:36:10.834,01:36:13.625,So this is probably the worst.
01:36:19.333,01:36:22.709,Dad.
01:36:22.750,01:36:27.000,"Oh, for God's sake."
01:36:27.041,01:36:30.000,What?
01:36:27.041,01:36:32.125,"Well, Kit Kat's just rolled up, blubbing her eyes out, and now you're here."
01:36:32.166,01:36:34.709,- What's Mum been saying?
01:36:34.750,01:36:39.583,"Yeah, well-- Apart from that?"
01:36:39.625,01:36:46.000,"It may have been the smoking, but I couldn't undo that as it was before you were all born."
01:36:46.041,01:36:48.583,"And anyway, your mother definitely wouldn't have gone out with me..."
01:36:48.625,01:36:51.667,if I hadn't been such a sexy smoker.
01:36:54.208,01:36:58.000,"I did get diagnosed as soon as possible, but it was too late."
01:37:00.125,01:37:02.834,- How long have we got?
01:37:00.125,01:37:06.750,"- Oh, you know-- It-- It could be... years."
01:37:09.667,01:37:11.875,- How long really?
01:37:13.917,01:37:15.291,"Weeks, I'm afraid."
01:37:22.959,01:37:24.917,Have we had this conversation before?
01:37:28.375,01:37:30.083,Yeah.
01:37:31.458,01:37:36.041,- What happened?
01:37:36.083,01:37:38.709,I hugged you.
01:37:57.125,01:38:01.375,Sorry.
01:37:57.125,01:38:05.875,"I think I just thought with the time thing-- No, I never said we could fix things."
01:38:05.917,01:38:08.542,"Life's a mixed bag, no matter who you are."
01:38:08.583,01:38:11.000,Look at Jesus.
01:38:08.583,01:38:13.208,"He was the Son of God, for God's sake, and look how that turned out."
01:38:11.041,01:38:17.500,"I know, but-- You must see I feel a bit cheated."
01:38:17.542,01:38:20.709,"Don't. In fact, feel the opposite."
01:38:20.750,01:38:24.625,The only people who give up work at 50 are the time travelers with cancer...
01:38:24.667,01:38:27.417,who want to play more table tennis with their sons.
01:38:29.291,01:38:30.709,Right.
01:38:32.208,01:38:33.709,So that's been the deal?
01:38:36.625,01:38:40.125,I'm sorry we had to call.
01:38:45.959,01:38:49.250,And... I have something very important to tell you.
01:38:49.291,01:38:51.458,Or let me check.
01:38:51.500,01:38:56.375,"Do you want to know the big secret, or would you rather find it out for yourself, like I did?"
01:38:56.417,01:38:59.208,"Oh, Christ."
01:38:59.250,01:39:03.458,Less dramatic.
01:39:03.500,01:39:05.834,The real mother ship.
01:39:08.500,01:39:11.333,"No, go on."
01:39:11.375,01:39:13.208,Let's save some time.
01:39:18.709,01:39:22.500,And so he told me his secret formula for happiness.
01:39:24.250,01:39:26.500,Part one of the two-part plan...
01:39:26.542,01:39:31.125,"was that I should just get on with ordinary life, living it day by day, like anyone else."
01:39:37.250,01:39:42.917,"This is our current statement with a revised, uh, paragraph there, highlighted."
01:39:42.959,01:39:47.834,"From the statutory objective under-- et cetera, et cetera-- Oh, Rupert. Rupert, is that the best you can do?"
01:39:47.875,01:39:52.083,No. No.
01:39:52.125,01:39:53.875,Item number two.
01:39:52.125,01:40:02.375,Uh-- Hi.
01:40:02.417,01:40:04.542,Eating in or taking away today?
01:40:04.583,01:40:06.834,Yeah?
01:40:06.875,01:40:09.166,"Lovely, that's 4.24 then, please, sir."
01:40:09.208,01:40:11.250,Thanks.
01:40:11.291,01:40:12.792,Lovely.
01:40:12.834,01:40:14.125,Great.
01:40:14.166,01:40:15.667,Thanks.
01:40:15.709,01:40:17.125,Hello there.
01:40:23.125,01:40:27.125,"Do you find the defendant, John Welbeck, guilty or not guilty of fraud?"
01:40:27.166,01:40:29.792,- Not guilty.
01:40:29.834,01:40:31.333,Yes.
01:40:31.375,01:40:32.792,"Oh, thank God."
01:40:32.834,01:40:34.375,Let the defendant be discharged.
01:40:35.959,01:40:37.709,Be upstanding in court.
01:40:51.291,01:40:53.875,Lights out?
01:40:53.917,01:40:56.750,Tough day.
01:40:56.792,01:40:59.458,But then came part two of Dad's plan.
01:41:01.166,01:41:05.875,He told me to live every day again almost exactly the same.
01:41:05.917,01:41:08.542,The first time with all the tensions and worries...
01:41:08.583,01:41:14.542,"that stop us noticing how sweet the world can be, but the second time..."
01:41:14.583,01:41:17.709,"Okay, Dad."
01:41:23.500,01:41:26.083,What's our statement at the moment?
01:41:23.500,01:41:42.542,"Uh, this-- Uh, this-- This is it with the revised-- Robert, this bears all the hallmarks-- - Is this the best you can do?"
01:41:42.583,01:41:46.875,- Ooh.
01:41:49.208,01:41:51.166,"Good afternoon, sir."
01:41:51.208,01:41:52.959,You eating in or taking away today?
01:41:53.000,01:41:55.083,Yeah? No problem.
01:41:55.125,01:41:57.166,That's fine.
01:41:57.208,01:41:59.625,Enjoy the rest of your day.
01:42:00.417,01:42:01.750,Hello there.
01:42:04.625,01:42:07.375,Oh! Oh!
01:42:07.417,01:42:10.166,Isn't this room beautiful?
01:42:10.208,01:42:12.333,All right then. Come on.
01:42:12.375,01:42:13.583,Not guilty.
01:42:17.125,01:42:19.500,- Fantastic!
01:42:52.125,01:42:55.625,So not such a bad day after all?
01:42:55.667,01:42:58.500,It was pretty good really.
01:42:58.542,01:43:01.917,"Very good day, actually-- as it turns out."
01:43:01.959,01:43:12.250,"Well, that's a relief, because if it had been a very bad day, I thought I might have had to have had sex with you to make up for it."
01:43:14.125,01:43:15.959,Good night.
01:43:18.625,01:43:20.625,Mmm.
01:43:20.667,01:43:25.625,"It was a very, very bad day."
01:43:25.667,01:43:28.959,I-I-- I got fired from my job.
01:43:29.000,01:43:30.625,And then I killed a man.
01:43:37.000,01:43:38.959,That is a very bad day.
01:43:39.000,01:43:41.834,It's terrible.
01:43:41.875,01:43:44.959,Like the worst day ever.
01:43:45.000,01:43:47.083,So sorry.
01:43:51.625,01:43:55.291,"Some days, of course though, you only want to go through once."
01:43:56.208,01:43:57.583,You okay?
01:44:48.542,01:44:51.792,Right. Are we ready for this?
01:44:51.834,01:44:55.375,Of course we're not.
01:44:55.417,01:44:58.792,"Just, uh, give me one minute."
01:45:20.834,01:45:24.291,This is so brilliant.
01:45:24.333,01:45:29.166,"Dickens is so good on actual jokes, actual... gags."
01:45:30.083,01:45:31.583,Where have you come from?
01:45:31.625,01:45:35.542,It's the-- Oh. Okay.
01:45:35.583,01:45:39.875,Big day.
01:45:39.917,01:45:41.709,How's Uncle Desmond's suit?
01:45:41.750,01:45:45.000,Oh. Immaculate.
01:45:45.041,01:45:47.834,Did I mention I wanted the Nick Cave track?
01:45:47.875,01:45:50.583,It's taken care of.
01:45:50.625,01:45:52.750,Can I just read you this one bit?
01:45:57.083,01:45:58.625,Read away.
01:45:58.667,01:46:01.125,I've got lots of time.
01:46:01.166,01:46:05.625,"I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with their noses."
01:46:05.667,01:46:09.500,Perhaps they became the restless people they were in consequence.
01:46:09.542,01:47:50.709,"Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me-- make your journey bright What do you think about the kids?"
01:47:50.750,01:47:52.125,What about them?
01:47:53.375,01:47:56.542,How many of them are there?
01:47:56.583,01:47:59.667,What?
01:47:56.583,01:48:02.333,"Well, I mean-- Two?"
01:48:02.375,01:48:04.834,That's-- That's more than the Chinese are allowed.
01:48:07.291,01:48:13.417,"I just thought that maybe, you know, it was time for the insurance baby."
01:48:13.458,01:48:15.709,What?
01:48:15.750,01:48:18.041,We don't want the other one to feel stupid their whole life.
01:48:18.083,01:48:22.125,"And if we had a third one, then we could have two happy dummies."
01:48:24.834,01:48:28.125,What do you think?
01:48:31.333,01:48:34.375,It was the toughest decision of my life.
01:48:34.417,01:48:38.583,Saying yes to the future meant saying good-bye to my dad... forever.
01:48:40.792,01:48:43.166,Why don't we wait a bit.
01:48:45.750,01:48:50.417,Absolutely.
01:48:54.375,01:48:57.917,How about now?
01:48:58.834,01:49:00.750,Or now.
01:49:02.583,01:49:03.834,Now?
01:49:11.333,01:49:14.750,Yeah. Okay.
01:49:15.875,01:49:17.125,Really?
01:49:19.542,01:49:22.041,Dad always wished there would be more of us.
01:49:22.875,01:49:29.041,"So-- Anyway, we might-- We might try, and nothing happens."
01:49:29.083,01:49:31.000,Exactly.
01:49:39.500,01:49:42.250,It really could be tonight.
01:49:42.291,01:49:45.834,And you cannot believe the detail in which I know the route to the hospital.
01:49:45.875,01:49:47.709,"Oh, yea."
01:49:50.750,01:49:53.542,Will you excuse me for a sec?
01:49:53.583,01:49:56.250,Just have to go downstairs.
01:50:11.959,01:50:14.875,17-20 in this incredibly tight contest...
01:50:14.917,01:50:18.959,being played by the two most physically perfect players in the history of the game.
01:50:19.000,01:50:22.083,"The crowd, enchanted by the younger player, are seduced by memories..."
01:50:22.125,01:50:24.458,of the older player's illustrious past.
01:50:24.500,01:50:27.291,"Oh, my God!"
01:50:27.333,01:50:31.667,I won!
01:50:31.709,01:50:34.959,You finally got good.
01:50:35.000,01:50:38.458,"What's my prize, apart from the Olympic gold medal, of course?"
01:50:38.500,01:50:40.625,A kiss will have to do.
01:50:40.667,01:50:45.000,A kiss? A kiss?
01:50:46.542,01:50:47.792,Oh.
01:50:49.250,01:50:51.041,Ah. I get you.
01:50:52.458,01:50:53.834,This is it then?
01:50:55.875,01:50:58.291,This is it.
01:50:58.333,01:51:01.709,It's my last bit of extra time.
01:51:01.750,01:51:03.709,The baby is completely on the way.
01:51:04.792,01:51:07.417,Oh.
01:51:24.458,01:51:26.792,Congratulations.
01:51:32.375,01:51:33.792,My son.
01:51:37.500,01:51:39.667,My dad.
01:51:43.417,01:51:46.083,Is there anything at all I can do?
01:51:46.125,01:51:48.083,Is there anything you want to do?
01:51:50.291,01:51:54.542,There is this...
01:51:54.583,01:51:56.000,one thing.
01:51:56.917,01:51:58.959,Quick little walk.
01:51:59.000,01:52:06.083,"Totally against the rules, of course, but if we don't change a thing, if we're very careful, it shouldn't do any harm."
01:52:06.834,01:52:08.375,It would be nice.
01:52:43.750,01:52:46.333,Get down low.
01:52:49.083,01:52:50.750,Total defeat!
01:52:50.792,01:52:52.291,Yes!
01:52:54.166,01:52:55.542,"Oh, I'm soaked!"
01:53:00.291,01:53:01.709,I'm tired.
01:53:02.792,01:53:04.917,"Thanks, Dad."
01:53:20.000,01:53:23.166,So I'm almost up to date with my story.
01:53:23.208,01:53:26.542,"As all families do, we got used to life after death."
01:53:26.583,01:53:29.500,And it was still fine.
01:53:29.542,01:53:33.709,And things settled back into their traditional rhythms-- Ooh!
01:53:32.125,01:53:36.542,"season after season, and are much as they have always been."
01:53:37.959,01:53:40.333,And we've got used to Kit Kat being happy again.
01:53:41.583,01:53:49.000,"And then we got used to her being a mum, albeit not a very good or even safe one."
01:53:49.041,01:53:51.667,"And in the end, I think I've learned the final lesson..."
01:53:51.709,01:53:54.417,from my travels in time.
01:53:54.458,01:53:57.458,And I've even gone one step further than my father did.
01:54:01.041,01:54:03.709,Oh.
01:54:08.625,01:54:12.000,"- Okay, I'll do the kids."
01:54:12.041,01:54:14.625,"No, don't worry."
01:54:14.667,01:54:17.583,"Yeah, you do them, you lazy bum."
01:54:17.625,01:54:22.125,"The truth is I now don't travel back at all, not even for the day."
01:54:22.166,01:54:31.542,"I just try to live every day as if I've deliberately come back to this one day-- to enjoy it as if it was the full, final day..."
01:54:31.583,01:54:34.083,of my extraordinary ordinary life.
01:54:58.542,01:55:02.458,Kiddo. Good kiddo.
01:55:02.500,01:55:06.250,Hello. You're down already.
01:55:06.291,01:55:08.917,And in we go. Come on.
01:55:08.959,01:55:12.333,- Posy? Posy?
01:55:16.333,01:55:21.333,- I'm fine.
01:55:21.375,01:55:23.000,Yeah!
01:55:32.709,01:55:36.125,When will I see you again?
01:55:42.166,01:55:48.583,"We're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives."
01:55:48.625,01:55:51.458,All we can do is do our best...
01:55:51.500,01:55:54.500,to relish this remarkable ride.
01:56:11.083,01:56:12.834,Oh!
01:56:12.875,01:56:14.542,Who did that?
01:56:36.750,01:56:39.041,"Yes, yes, yes. Well, I know it's over soon."
01:56:40.250,01:56:42.625,Mm-hmm.
01:56:51.542,01:56:53.500,Okay. I'll see you then.
01:56:53.542,01:56:56.417,Bye-bye.
