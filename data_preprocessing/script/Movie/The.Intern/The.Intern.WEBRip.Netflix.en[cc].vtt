00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.929  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, here you go.

200

JULES: <i>I love it.</i>

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:19.100  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Great, and it's up.
-Okay. Thanks, everybody.

00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:20.935  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
ALL: Thank you.

203
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.065  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, so...

204
00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.901  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The Antoinette dress.
Major screw-up by the vendor.

205
00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's gonna be a couple
of interviews today, Ben.

206
00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:34.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We wanna make sure that
we both find the right fit.

207
00:09:34.406 --> 00:09:36.492  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
"Business as usual"
is not really our motto,

208
00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.244  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
so we hope you have some fun here.

209
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.663  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This is the first time
we are hiring senior interns,

210
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.164  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
so some of our intern questions

211
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:43.750  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
may not exactly fit your profile,

212
00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.251  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but we're gonna go for it anyway, okay?

213
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.753  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Fire away.

214
00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.921  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, good. Where'd you go to school?

215
00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.422  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I went to Northwestern.

216
00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.634  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hey, my brother went to Northwestern.

217
00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.176  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Probably not at the same time.

218
00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:56.679  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Probably not. He graduated in 2009.

219
00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.514  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Class of '65.
-(CHUCKLES)

220
00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:02.143  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Wow, what was your major?
Do you remember?

221
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.522  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And after Northwestern, you went on to...

222
00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:07.940  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I went to work for Dex One.

223
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.692  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, and they made...

224
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:10.902  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Phonebooks.
-Oh.

225
00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:12.528  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I was in charge of overseeing the printing

226
00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:13.696  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
of the physical phonebook.

227
00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.281  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I did that for over 20 years,

228
00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:17.283  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and before that I was their
VP of sales and advertising.

229
00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:19.786  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, do they still make phonebooks?

230
00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.913  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, doesn't everyone
just Google numbers?

231
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:23.915  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I believe they do, but before
Google that was how you got...

232
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:26.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, no, no. Yeah, I get it.

233
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So 40 years at the phonebook company?

234
00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:30.129  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That is amazing, seriously.

235
00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.131  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, Benjamin.
Now, I'm gonna ask you one of

236
00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.216  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
our more telling questions
for all of our interns,

237
00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:35.467  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
so I want you to, like, this is the one

238
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:36.636  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
to really think about, okay?

239
00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.470  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And take your time.

240
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.556  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Where do you see yourself in 10 years?

241
00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.475  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
When I'm 80?

242
00:10:44.476 --> 00:10:47.146  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, sure. Yeah, whatever. Um...

243
00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.524  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wait. Did not realize you were 70.

244
00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:52.652  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That question just doesn't
work for you, does it?

245
00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.696  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Should we just scratch
that one and just move on?

246
00:10:54.862 --> 00:10:56.823  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-It's your call, Justin.
-Okay, that one's gone.

247
00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:58.324  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You look great, by the way, so great,

248
00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.326  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and you're clearly more
than qualified for this job.

249
00:11:00.492 --> 00:11:01.661  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're actually, like, way overqualified,

250
00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:02.829  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and we were so impressed.

251
00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:04.872  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You had great interviews, great video.

252
00:11:05.414 --> 00:11:06.999  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You nailed it, Ben. Congrats.

253
00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.417  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're an intern.

254
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.878  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hey.
I need you for two minutes, uninterrupted.

255
00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:12.213  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Hi. Okay.
-Remember a few weeks ago,

256
00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:14.173  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
we talked about the senior intern program?

257
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.341  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No.

258
00:11:15.507 --> 00:11:17.885  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Really?
We had a whole, big conversation about it.

259
00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:19.178  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We did? Okay, remind me.

260
00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.722  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Seniors in high school or college?

261
00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:24.058  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, no, no. Seniors in life. Older people.

262
00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.351  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hold on. What?

263
00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:26.685  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I told you I felt like we needed

264
00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:27.895  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
to do an outreach program.

265
00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:29.731  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You definitely seemed
to be liking the idea,

266
00:11:29.897 --> 00:11:31.523  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
so I set it in motion.
It's gonna be great.

267
00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:35.027  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hold, please.
You're hiring senior citizen interns?

268
00:11:35.277 --> 00:11:36.863  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There's been a ton of research on this,

269
00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:39.573  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and the results are actually incredible.

270
00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:40.867  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I mean, imagine having an intern

271
00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:42.409  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
with a lifetime of experience

272
00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:43.870  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
as opposed to somebody who spent

273
00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:45.704  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
the last four years of
their life playing beer pong.

274
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:47.248  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Do they eventually want jobs here?

275
00:11:47.414 --> 00:11:49.291  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, darling, they're all retired.

276
00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:51.377  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They just want the experience.

277
00:11:51.543 --> 00:11:54.213  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I would like one to
work directly with you.

278
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.298  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Wait, Cameron, no.
-Wha...

279
00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.968  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
First of all, I'm not great
with older people.

280
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.888  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know how I am with my parents.
This could be...

281
00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:03.097  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why do I have to have one?

282
00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:04.891  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Because you have to set the tone.

283
00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:07.393  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now, would you prefer a man or a woman?

284
00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:09.603  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's a great 72-year-old woman,
really cute.

285
00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.981  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Ugh. That's like the same age as my mom.
That's too weird.

286
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.274  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's fine.
There's a man everyone loves.

287
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.441  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He seems amazing.

288
00:12:14.608 --> 00:12:16.110  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I watched his video with the whole group.

289
00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:18.112  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
People were crying.

290
00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:21.407  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, this is not
going to work, in my opinion.

291
00:12:21.573 --> 00:12:23.785  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But how long do I have to do this for?
Minimum?

292
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:26.245  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Six weeks, or we'll be sued.

293
00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.580  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I know we never talked about this.

294
00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:30.416  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, we did. For real.

295
00:12:30.582 --> 00:12:32.084  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He starts tomorrow.

296
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.224  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hmm.

298
00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:57.151  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Back in action.

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.403  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank God.

00:21:54.145 --> 00:21:55.814  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But then, I sort of

512
00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:58.149  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
accidentally slept with her roommate.

513
00:21:58.317 --> 00:21:59.401  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That doesn't help.

514
00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:01.027  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I didn't know she was her roommate.
I met her out.

515
00:22:01.194 --> 00:22:02.321  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How would I know that?

516
00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:03.739  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-FIONA: Hey, Nikki!
-Ben, tell me.

517
00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:06.157  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't know this stuff. You're older.

518
00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:08.369  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You've been through a lot.

519
00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:11.622  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I mean, you have a lot of experience.

520
00:22:11.788 --> 00:22:13.707  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
How long do you think
she'll be mad at me for?

521
00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:15.334  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Jay, I have zero experience with women,

522
00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:17.168  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and I can tell you, there's
no coming back from that one.

523
00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.338  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I assume you talked to her, apologized,

524
00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:21.006  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
told her how much she means to you...

525
00:22:21.172 --> 00:22:23.133  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, you know...

526
00:22:23.634 --> 00:22:24.718  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You didn't talk to her?

527
00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:26.094  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What did you do, send her a tweet?

528
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:30.140  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, of course not.
I, like, texted her a billion times.

529
00:22:30.306 --> 00:22:33.477  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She didn't answer, so then I e-mailed her.

530
00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:34.853  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But it was, like, a nice e-mail.

531
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.522  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was a long one, well-thought-out.

532
00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:38.189  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Subject line I wrote, "I'm sorry,"

533
00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:39.691  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
with like a ton of "O's."

534
00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:41.402  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So it was like, "I'm sorry,"

535
00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:43.654  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:48.199 --> 00:22:50.536  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I should probably actually
just talk to her, huh?

538
00:22:50.994 --> 00:22:51.995  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Obviously.

539
00:22:52.162 --> 00:22:53.872  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Can't imagine it would hurt.

540
00:22:54.665 --> 00:22:55.916  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, did yesterday's numbers come in?

00:22:56.082 --> 00:22:57.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah.

00:22:57.751 --> 00:22:59.210  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
BEN: We could do it that way, too.

543
00:22:59.377 --> 00:23:01.212  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I noticed my intern sure keeps busy.

00:23:05.383 --> 00:23:06.968  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, do not look at that desk.

00:23:07.135 --> 00:23:08.261  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's like the office junk drawer.

00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:09.763  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:23:15.561 --> 00:23:19.397  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, seriously?
How did this even happen?

00:23:28.699 --> 00:23:30.784  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, no, I can set it up.

00:23:41.462 --> 00:23:45.549  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They would like us
to consider the possibility...

00:23:45.716 --> 00:23:46.717  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:24:00.731 --> 00:24:02.608  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

at running a business?

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:43.815  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:47.318  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But isn't this
what a startup is?

00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:48.945  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:51.782  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:24:51.948 --> 00:24:54.951  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That it's all going too fast,

00:24:58.204 --> 00:25:00.123  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
could take some things off your plate.

591
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.168  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:25:04.502 --> 00:25:06.046  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

they are going to want to
do things their way.

00:25:11.467 --> 00:25:13.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I mean, how can I do what I do

00:25:13.887 --> 00:25:15.806  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Oh, my shoe. Sorry.

00:49:04.233 --> 00:49:05.234  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So?

I don't know, kid.
This lease doesn't look so hot to me.

1140
00:49:12.157 --> 00:49:14.034  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.411  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:19.831  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I've never seen you so awake.

00:49:20.832 --> 00:49:22.834  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I was just asked to deliver
this huge order to Tribeca,

00:49:26.505 --> 00:49:27.589  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:28.757  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:49:28.923 --> 00:49:30.217  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:49:34.346 --> 00:49:35.430  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:49:35.722 --> 00:49:36.890  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

who you're talking about.

00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:39.268  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, maybe you should put on
a proper shirt with a collar.

1155
00:49:39.601 --> 00:49:41.186  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
A collar?
These are hip-hop people.

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:55.867  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

I mean, she yelled at me, but...

00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:01.165  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She yells at me all the time, too.

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:02.957  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:50:53.633 --> 00:50:55.469  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, you don't actually
have to keep doing that.

00:50:55.635 --> 00:50:57.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, force of habit.

Swiped these from the tech fridge.

00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:17.491  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I noticed a couple hours ago,

1185
00:51:17.657 --> 00:51:19.909  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you had a meeting with
another possible CEO.

1186
00:51:20.076 --> 00:51:22.204  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I saw him arrive. How'd that go?

1187
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:25.665  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was going well until he called us...

00:51:25.832 --> 00:51:28.460  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I believe the term

00:51:29.878 --> 00:51:32.172  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

anything he said after that.

1190
00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:34.841  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Apparently, selling clothes
makes us a "chick site."

1191
00:51:35.008 --> 00:51:37.886  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:51:38.052 --> 00:51:40.139  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I couldn't agree more.
I find that surprising.

00:51:40.305 --> 00:51:42.641  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Really? Sexism in business?

00:51:44.893 --> 00:51:45.977  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:51:46.811 --> 00:51:49.022  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

before you retired?

00:51:49.564 --> 00:51:51.441  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I was a VP for Dex One.

1197
00:51:51.608 --> 00:51:52.651  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:51:52.817 --> 00:51:54.861  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:51:55.028 --> 00:51:57.071  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and before that I ran
sales and advertising.

00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:58.740  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:52:01.034 --> 00:52:03.370  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Wasn't this a factory that
used to make phonebooks?

1202
00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:10.043  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:12.003  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:52:12.671 --> 00:52:14.339  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is where you worked?

00:52:14.923 --> 00:52:16.591  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:52:18.092 --> 00:52:19.093  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh.

00:52:19.261 --> 00:52:21.180  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1208
00:52:21.346 --> 00:52:23.348  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
For twenty-some years
I sat right by that window.

00:52:23.932 --> 00:52:25.392  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That was my office.

1210
00:52:26.393 --> 00:52:28.562  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was a few steps up back then.

1211
00:52:28.728 --> 00:52:31.356  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And we could look out
over the whole factory.

00:52:31.523 --> 00:52:33.107  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Our printing presses were in that corner.

00:52:33.275 --> 00:52:34.943  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's why the floor dips back there.

00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:37.028  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No way.

00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:44.536  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah. The big ones. I love them.

00:52:44.703 --> 00:52:46.705  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah.

00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:52.043  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Is it totally weird being back here?

00:52:52.211 --> 00:52:54.379  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, it feels like home. It's...

00:52:57.674 --> 00:52:58.883  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but home.

00:53:04.223 --> 00:53:06.015  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So you're on Facebook, huh?

1225
00:53:06.182 --> 00:53:07.392  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I've been trying to figure it out.

better things to do.

And the channels you're least investing in

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:11.055  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll say something to her.

Okay. Here's my theory about this.

1848
01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:26.665  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We all grew up during

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:28.041  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
the "Take Your Daughter

1850
01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:29.459  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mmm-hmm.

1851
01:16:29.627 --> 01:16:31.336  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So we were always told
we could be anything,

1852
01:16:31.503 --> 01:16:32.838  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:35.465  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I think guys got,

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:37.425  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but not quite as nurtured, you know?

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.136  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I mean, like, we were the generation of,

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.643  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Oh, my God, when?

2261
01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:55.809  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yesterday.

2262
01:36:56.643 --> 01:36:57.937  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm sorry.

2263
01:36:58.104 --> 01:37:00.814  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, it was an accident
that I saw them, but I did.

2264
01:37:01.273 --> 01:37:02.649  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yesterday.

2265
01:37:03.567 --> 01:37:05.402  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Then it is still going on.

2266
01:37:07.821 --> 01:37:09.073  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How long have you known?

2267
01:37:09.781 --> 01:37:11.617  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
For, like, 18 days.

2268
01:37:11.993 --> 01:37:13.827  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She's a mom at Paige's school.

2269
01:37:15.246 --> 01:37:16.830  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's still so hard for me to grasp.

2270
01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:19.208  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I was in the kitchen making sandwiches,

2271
01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:20.376  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and his phone was there.

2272
01:37:20.542 --> 01:37:21.835  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He was upstairs with Paige,

2273
01:37:22.003 --> 01:37:23.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and he was getting
all these text messages.

2274
01:37:23.670 --> 01:37:25.464  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I don't know why, but I read them.

2275
01:37:26.465 --> 01:37:28.175  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was not good.

2276
01:37:29.093 --> 01:37:30.094  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Does he know you know?

2277
01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:31.595  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No.

2278
01:37:31.762 --> 01:37:35.599  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
'Cause, honestly,
I'm not ready to deal with it.

2279
01:37:35.766 --> 01:37:37.518  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I would like to be
a little less devastated,

2280
01:37:37.684 --> 01:37:39.145  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
if that is possible.

2281
01:37:40.687 --> 01:37:42.439  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's classic, though, isn't it?

2282
01:37:42.606 --> 01:37:43.857  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
The successful wife.

2283
01:37:44.025 --> 01:37:45.859  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The husband feels like
his manhood is threatened,

2284
01:37:46.027 --> 01:37:47.653  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
so he acts out.

2285
01:37:47.819 --> 01:37:48.820  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Girlfriend, I guess,

2286
01:37:48.988 --> 01:37:50.531  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
makes him feel more like a man.

2287
01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:54.952  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sometimes I'm not sure
I know how to do that.

2288
01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:56.620  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

2289
01:37:56.787 --> 01:37:57.788  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're not actually
taking the rap

2290
01:37:57.955 --> 01:37:58.956  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
for any of this, are you?

2291
01:37:59.123 --> 01:38:01.125  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No! No, no.

2292
01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:02.709  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He is the one doing something wrong.

2293
01:38:02.876 --> 01:38:03.877  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I get that.

2294
01:38:04.045 --> 01:38:05.712  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Monogam-ish is not what I'm after.

2295
01:38:05.879 --> 01:38:08.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm just... I'm taking a sec,

2296
01:38:09.008 --> 01:38:10.467  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I'm hoping that it's just

2297
01:38:10.634 --> 01:38:13.304  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
a horrible lapse in judgment
and not, like, love.

2298
01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:17.224  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And once he moves through this,

2299
01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:19.476  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
we will eventually
be able to be okay again.

01:38:19.643 --> 01:38:21.020  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What do you think about that?

2301
01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:25.149  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Clearly you don't think
that's a possible thing.

2302
01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:27.734  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-It would be unusual.
-I get that.

2303
01:38:27.901 --> 01:38:32.073  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I get not everybody could do that,

2304
01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:34.075  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but everybody's not us.

2305
01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:35.492  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I have faith in us

2306
01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:39.496  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
because I believe he still loves me.

2307
01:38:39.663 --> 01:38:42.583  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And, you know, we've been
going through so much that...

2308
01:38:45.252 --> 01:38:47.588  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
God, I wish your expressions
weren't so transparent.

01:38:48.714 --> 01:38:50.382  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Some couples do survive these things,

2310
01:38:50.549 --> 01:38:51.550  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you know. I Googled it,

2311
01:38:51.717 --> 01:38:52.926  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
"Staying together after the affair."

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:55.346  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And a lot of couples,
I mean, a lot stay together.

2313
01:38:56.097 --> 01:38:57.598  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And anyway, there is something to be said

2314
01:38:57.764 --> 01:38:58.765  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
about moving through it

2315
01:38:58.932 --> 01:39:02.061  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and focusing on us and not on the affair.

2316
01:39:02.228 --> 01:39:04.271  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't wanna give up on him.

01:39:05.231 --> 01:39:08.025  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
(CRYING) I know him,

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.570  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But I am only human,

01:39:12.113 --> 01:39:14.281  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:17.784  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, so much has
happened to us so fast.

2321
01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:21.455  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think part of me
was even expecting this.

2322
01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:23.415  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Like, you know, he was
the more successful one

01:39:23.582 --> 01:39:24.583  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
when we started out.

01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:25.917  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, I didn't know that.

01:39:26.085 --> 01:39:27.919  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, he was. He was a rising star.

01:39:28.087 --> 01:39:29.796  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And he bowed out so that I could do this.

2327
01:39:29.963 --> 01:39:31.548  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He was amazing.

01:39:32.299 --> 01:39:34.135  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was all his idea.

I'm sure that's why I'm even considering

01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:37.763  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
this whole CEO thing,

01:39:37.929 --> 01:39:41.433  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
thinking maybe someone else coming in

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.976  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
will help me get my life back on track.

01:39:43.144 --> 01:39:45.312  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, that's it.
I hate to be the feminist here,

2334
01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:46.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
between the two of us,

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:48.315  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but you should be able
to have a huge career

01:39:48.482 --> 01:39:50.484  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and be who you are
without having to accept that

01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:52.986  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
your husband is having an
affair as some kinda payback.

01:39:55.739 --> 01:39:58.659  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Me, too. But such is life, my friend.

01:39:58.825 --> 01:40:00.161  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, it isn't. Not always.

2341
01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:02.079  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I'm not so sure I'd be so forgiving.

2342
01:40:02.246 --> 01:40:03.247  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I am not so forgiving.

2343
01:40:03.414 --> 01:40:05.499  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm saying that I could
potentially be forgiving.

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:08.001  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But don't think that I don't
feel what's going on here.

2345
01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:09.420  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's crushing.

2346
01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:12.756  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And when I think of Paige...

2347
01:40:12.923 --> 01:40:14.091  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, don't. Oh...

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:18.845  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Also, if we got divorced, he'd remarry.

2349
01:40:19.012 --> 01:40:21.765  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Maybe not to this girl, but someone.

01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:26.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And we both know I'm not easy.

01:40:28.147 --> 01:40:29.690  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So I could be, like, single forever,

01:40:29.856 --> 01:40:31.608  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
which means that...

2353
01:40:31.775 --> 01:40:34.653  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Forgive me, but this does keep me up

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:36.155  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:40:39.283 --> 01:40:41.327  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:43.036  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Paige'll be with her husband,

01:40:43.204 --> 01:40:44.538  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and Matt'll be with his new family,

01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:46.039  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I will be buried with strangers.

01:40:46.207 --> 01:40:47.999  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I will buried in
