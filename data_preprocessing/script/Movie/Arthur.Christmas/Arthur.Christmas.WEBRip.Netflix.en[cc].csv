00:15:59.166,00:16:00.877,That detachable milk maid thing.
00:16:00.877,00:16:04.714,"This is just the beginning, right, sir?"
00:16:04.714,00:16:06.674,"I got you a present, sir."
00:16:06.674,00:16:09.803,"Not S for Steve, sir."
00:16:09.803,00:16:11.888,S for Santa.
00:16:11.888,00:16:15.642,"Oh, I don't know about that, Peter."
00:16:15.642,00:16:17.977,"Okay, let's bring them home."

00:17:03.105,00:17:05.859,"It only goes 150,000 miles an hour."
00:17:05.859,00:17:08.778,"No, no. Thanks. I see a bit of the world in my office."
00:17:08.778,00:17:11.155,Some of the stamps I get are amazing.
00:17:11.155,00:17:13.783,BRYONY: Excuse me.
00:17:13.783,00:17:15.576,ALL: Santa!

00:17:18.746,00:17:21.708,I'm sorry.
00:17:21.708,00:17:23.543,Santa's waving!
00:17:23.543,00:17:25.294,DEBORAH: He's waving at me!
00:17:25.294,00:17:27.213,"Dad! Ha, ha!"
00:17:27.213,00:17:29.173,Arthur.
00:17:29.173,00:17:31.342,Happy Christmas.
00:17:31.342,00:17:33.845,You too.
00:17:33.845,00:17:35.304,You were fantastic!
00:17:37.015,00:17:39.433,Look! Christmas slippers.
00:17:39.433,00:17:42.186,Ha! Well done. Yes.
00:17:42.186,00:17:43.563,STEVE: Father?
00:17:43.563,00:17:47.025,"Ah, there he is."
00:17:51.237,00:17:54.407,Mission accomplished!
00:17:58.494,00:18:02.707,Tonight we delivered 2 billion presents.

00:18:12.926,00:18:15.011,"Oh, thank you."
00:18:15.011,00:18:18.014,"You know, I sometimes think I couldn't do it without you."
00:18:18.014,00:18:30.401,"Heh-heh. And my splendid Margaret, who's stood by me all these years very ably doing all that, uh, stuff that women do when their husbands work."
00:18:32.820,00:18:36.699,"SANTA: And, uh, Arthur, yes, doing vital work in Maintenance, really vital."
00:18:36.699,00:18:38.993,"I, um-- I work in Letters."
00:18:38.993,00:18:41.537,"Letters, of course."
00:18:41.537,00:18:45.291,You moved me after I tripped over that plug and melted down the elf barracks.
00:18:45.291,00:18:47.209,DAVID: I lost everything in that flood!
00:18:47.209,00:18:54.550,"Yes. Now, many years ago, my father told me..."
00:18:56.427,00:19:00.306,...that being Santa is the best job in the world.
00:19:00.306,00:19:02.016,He was right.
00:19:02.016,00:19:04.310,I've loved it.
00:19:06.604,00:19:10.357,I can't wait for year 71!
00:19:16.072,00:19:17.698,"Merry Christmas, everyone."
00:19:29.919,00:19:32.088,"He's red, he's white!"
00:19:32.088,00:19:33.840,He's worked all through the night!
00:19:33.840,00:19:35.382,Santa!
00:19:50.106,00:19:54.902,What do you get if you eat Christmas decorations?
00:19:54.902,00:19:56.445,Tinselitis!
00:20:00.116,00:20:03.202,Isn't this the best bit of Christmas?
00:20:05.788,00:20:10.001,"It certainly is, Arthur."
00:20:10.001,00:20:11.752,"How about a toast, Malcolm?"
00:20:11.752,00:20:13.671,Oh! Um...
00:20:13.671,00:20:17.466,"Well, uh, here's to me doing an even better job next year."
00:20:17.466,00:20:19.802,Next year.
00:20:19.802,00:20:22.138,Ha! That turkey did more than him.
00:20:22.138,00:20:23.890,"Ha, ha! Aah!"
00:20:23.890,00:20:26.100,"SANTA: You wouldn't understand, Father."
00:20:26.100,00:20:29.478,"I've rather moved things on since your day. Eh, Steve?"
00:20:29.478,00:20:31.147,Forget Techno Tommy.
00:20:31.147,00:20:34.108,He's texting on his calculator after another job.
00:20:34.108,00:20:37.695,It's a Handheld Operational and Homing Organizer.
00:20:37.695,00:20:41.365,The HOHO 3000. I'm enacting mission closure.
00:20:41.365,00:20:43.743,Whoopee-doo.
00:20:43.743,00:20:45.452,Don't matter what you come up with.
00:20:45.452,00:20:50.124,"You may be next in line, but you'll never get to be Santa unless you knock him off."
00:20:51.834,00:20:54.879,ARTHUR: Um...
00:20:54.879,00:20:59.717,"After all the hard work, I wanted everyone to have some Christmas fun."
00:20:59.717,00:21:01.260,Ta-da!
00:21:20.780,00:21:23.074,GRANDSANTA: I'm Santa!
00:21:23.074,00:21:24.450,It's ridiculous.
00:21:24.450,00:21:26.160,You just took the piece out of my hand.
00:21:26.160,00:21:29.538,"Well, I am actually Santa so I think I should have it."
00:21:29.538,00:21:32.291,Yes. You're the nonexecutive figurehead.
00:21:32.291,00:21:33.751,Exactly. Figurehead.
00:21:33.751,00:21:36.045,It means a fatty with a beard who fits the suit.
00:21:36.045,00:21:38.089,The other pieces are good too.
00:21:38.089,00:21:40.216,Or I can make extra Santa's for everyone.
00:21:41.425,00:21:43.261,"Why don't you be the candle, Steve?"
00:21:43.261,00:21:45.304,"All those bright ideas, eh?"
00:21:45.304,00:21:52.686,"Fine. I'm the candle, Arthur's the turkey and you, Father, are, of course, Santa."
00:21:52.686,00:21:55.231,"Grandsanta, you can be this charming relic."
00:21:55.231,00:21:57.233,Relic? Relic?
00:21:57.233,00:22:00.236,"I did the whole of Christmas in one of these, Arthur."
00:22:00.236,00:22:03.156,"Oh, yes. I didn't need a trillion elves in bleepy hats."
00:22:03.156,00:22:07.326,We don't fly about throwing lead-painted toys down chimneys anymore.
00:22:07.326,00:22:09.536,That space sends you back to Lapland.
00:22:09.536,00:22:12.039,"Malcolm, where did you get those?"
00:22:12.039,00:22:14.750,Just moving things along.
00:22:14.750,00:22:16.294,"Cheats, the pair of you!"
00:22:16.294,00:22:17.670,"ARTHUR: Mum, are you okay?"
00:22:17.670,00:22:20.298,"Polar bear, dear."
00:22:20.298,00:22:24.218,Good I did that online survival course or there'd be one less for turkey.
00:22:24.218,00:22:26.137,Christmas has gone right down the rodney hole.
00:22:26.137,00:22:28.639,You're a postman with a spaceship.
00:22:28.639,00:22:34.020,"My S-1 festivized the world at 1,860 times the speed of sound."
00:22:34.020,00:22:39.483,"Christmas 1941, World War II, I did the whole thing with six reindeer and a drunken elf!"
00:22:39.483,00:22:41.359,"I was shot at, Arthur."
00:22:41.359,00:22:43.737,Took 12 direct hits.
00:22:43.737,00:22:45.072,What happened to the elf?
00:22:45.072,00:22:47.033,Fell out of the sleigh over Lake Geneva.
00:22:47.033,00:22:49.327,Never saw him again.
00:22:49.327,00:22:53.247,Christmas crackers.
00:22:53.247,00:22:55.082,Who'd know that?
00:23:00.880,00:23:02.298,I went on alone.
00:23:02.298,00:23:05.301,"I could still do it now, Arthur."
00:23:05.301,00:23:07.803,In a heap of sticks.
00:23:07.803,00:23:09.096,Let me up and at him!
00:23:09.096,00:23:11.682,"I'll show you, Robby the Robot!"
00:23:11.682,00:23:13.809,"Oh, dear."
00:23:13.809,00:23:15.936,I'll have that back.
00:23:15.936,00:23:17.313,What?
00:23:17.313,00:23:20.524,"Oh, yeah. Run away now you're losing!"
00:23:24.444,00:23:26.655,ARTHUR: Steve! Whoa! Unh!
00:23:26.655,00:23:28.282,Steve.
00:23:28.282,00:23:29.909,Don't be upset.
00:23:29.909,00:23:31.911,You keep this.
00:23:31.911,00:23:34.538,Then you can be Santa next time.
00:23:36.290,00:23:37.917,"That'll be you there, Steve."
00:23:37.917,00:23:40.794,"Next year, I bet."
00:23:40.794,00:23:42.420,You'll be great.
00:23:43.881,00:23:45.758,"How many times, Arthur?"
00:23:45.758,00:23:50.221,It's the North Pole.
00:23:52.973,00:23:54.267,BRYONY: I secured the gift.
00:23:54.267,00:23:56.434,Gift secured!
00:23:56.434,00:23:57.770,The system is foolproof.
00:23:57.770,00:24:00.314,"It has to be an error, sir."
00:24:00.314,00:24:02.566,I spotted the ribbon glinting in the shadows.
00:24:02.566,00:24:05.361,I am actually trained in wrapping.
00:24:05.361,00:24:07.947,"And I said to myself, Bryony, the wrapping looks okay."
00:24:07.947,00:24:09.489,Thank goodness.
00:24:09.489,00:24:13.327,"But that present should not be lying in the-- Thank you, soldier."
00:24:13.327,00:24:16.163,Has someone got the wrong present? That's awful.
00:24:16.163,00:24:19.250,Whose is it?
00:24:19.250,00:24:21.752,47785 BXK.
00:24:21.752,00:24:23.296,Gift undelivered?
00:24:23.296,00:24:25.298,They got nothing?
00:24:25.298,00:24:27.716,Mm-mm?
00:24:27.716,00:24:30.428,Not necessarily.
00:24:32.179,00:24:34.181,A child's been missed!
00:24:34.181,00:24:35.724,Wanna wake up the North Pole?
00:24:35.724,00:24:37.268,Good idea.
00:24:37.268,00:24:38.727,STEVE: Arthur!
00:24:40.229,00:24:41.521,Everything all right?
00:24:41.521,00:24:42.982,There's been a glitch.
00:24:42.982,00:24:45.567,A glitch?
00:24:45.567,00:24:48.946,Really?
00:24:48.946,00:24:50.448,"How did you let it happen, Steven?"
00:24:50.448,00:24:52.741,How did I--?
00:24:52.741,00:24:55.161,No. This is your department.
00:24:55.161,00:24:59.706,"We must, um-- We must, uh-- What must we do, Steven?"
00:24:59.706,00:25:01.208,STEVE: There's nothing to do.
00:25:01.208,00:25:03.002,The mission was a success.
00:25:03.002,00:25:04.544,We can't leave a child out of Christmas.
00:25:04.544,00:25:07.631,Ah. Sunrise at destination is 7:39 a.m.
00:25:07.631,00:25:09.591,There's no way to get there in time.
00:25:09.591,00:25:11.551,"Except, of course, for the S-1."
00:25:11.551,00:25:13.679,The S-1. Right-o.
00:25:11.551,00:25:15.889,STEVE: No! The S-1 has just traveled 7 million miles.
00:25:15.889,00:25:17.391,We could damage it.
00:25:17.391,00:25:19.018,"Oh, dear. Um..."
00:25:19.018,00:25:21.770,And risk the lives of the elves.
00:25:21.770,00:25:26.608,"I'll go, sir! Bryony Shelfley, Wrapping Division."
00:25:26.608,00:25:27.901,Who asked you?
00:25:27.901,00:25:29.820,I wasn't called up for field duty.
00:25:29.820,00:25:32.072,I served out my mission in Gift Wrap Support.
00:25:32.072,00:25:35.701,"I wrapped 264,000 presents in three days, sir."
00:25:35.701,00:25:40.873,"If you want that bike delivered in a perfect state of enwrapment, then I'm your elf."
00:25:40.873,00:25:43.459,No one is going.
00:25:43.459,00:25:51.509,"But this child-- It's a margin of error of 0.00000001514834 percent, sir."
00:25:51.509,00:25:53.927,"Wow. I mean, hello?"
00:25:53.927,00:25:55.388,Where's the champagne?
00:25:55.388,00:26:00.184,My department has delivered the most outstanding Christmas ever.
00:26:00.184,00:26:01.810,"Oh, uh..."
00:26:01.810,00:26:03.854,"Well done, us."
00:26:03.854,00:26:06.357,But there's a child without a present.
00:26:06.357,00:26:08.817,"Arthur, Christmas is not a time for emotion."
00:26:08.817,00:26:14.823,We will get 47785BXK a present within the window of Christmas.
00:26:14.823,00:26:17.326,We'll messenger the item.
00:26:17.326,00:26:19.577,But that'll ruin the magic.
00:26:21.830,00:26:25.167,If there was any way at all to make the drop tonight.
00:26:25.167,00:26:27.920,But it can't be done.
00:26:25.167,00:26:30.214,SANTA: Your brother knows about these things.
00:26:30.214,00:26:34.760,"I won't sleep easy after this, Arthur, but there it is."
00:26:34.760,00:26:36.512,Can't be done.
00:26:38.264,00:26:40.140,Merry Christmas.
00:26:46.230,00:26:49.483,Arthur! You're compromising the wrapping!
00:26:49.483,00:26:51.444,That is not a toy!
00:26:51.444,00:26:55.030,"Well, it is, but, I mean, that's not-- Arthur!"
00:26:55.030,00:26:58.033,ARTHUR: Um...
00:26:58.033,00:27:02.871,"Child 47785BXK, where are you?"
00:27:04.373,00:27:06.666,"Dear Santa, my friend doesn't believe in you."
00:27:06.666,00:27:10.170,For Christmas I'd like a pink Twinkle Bike.
00:27:10.170,00:27:12.548,Gwen Hines.

00:27:44.246,00:27:49.960,"This figurehead thingy: I'm not just a fatty with a suit, am I?"
00:27:49.960,00:27:52.670,"Of course not, dear."
00:27:52.670,00:27:55.673,No. I'm Santa.
00:27:55.673,00:27:59.886,Children rely on me.
00:27:59.886,00:28:01.888,"Oh. Ugh. Ha, ha."
00:28:01.888,00:28:03.390,Here.
00:28:03.390,00:28:05.934,Thank you.
00:28:03.390,00:28:07.478,It's just checks for the boys and cash for Father.
00:28:07.478,00:28:08.812,"Oh, Malcolm."
00:28:08.812,00:28:10.981,"It's the 2 billion other gifts, dear."
00:28:10.981,00:28:13.775,Christmas has become such a mad rush.
00:28:13.775,00:28:16.694,Until you retire.
00:28:16.694,00:28:18.614,Retire?
00:28:18.614,00:28:21.074,"Sit next to Father, watching Steve on TV?"
00:28:22.993,00:28:25.329,You are sitting on a level one access HOHO.
00:28:25.329,00:28:28.207,Please state your identity.
00:28:28.207,00:28:30.708,Who would I be?
00:28:30.708,00:28:34.046,"You'd be my Malcolm, dear."
00:28:34.046,00:28:36.674,And there's Arthur.
00:28:36.674,00:28:38.091,Dear Arthur.
00:28:38.091,00:28:40.802,What a puzzle.
00:28:40.802,00:28:43.430,Oh!
00:28:43.430,00:28:44.848,"Happy Christmas, Margaret."
00:28:44.848,00:28:46.308,"Oh, thank you."
00:28:46.308,00:28:48.561,"I'm still very much up to the job, you know."
00:28:48.561,00:28:54.024,"Ho, ho-- Good night, dear."
00:28:54.024,00:28:56.943,"Good night, Malcolm."
00:29:00.113,00:29:02.575,It just can't be.
00:29:02.575,00:29:04.826,It just can't be. It can't.
00:29:06.119,00:29:08.247,"What's all this kadoodle, young man?"
00:29:08.247,00:29:10.708,Grandsanta. This little girl.
00:29:10.708,00:29:14.294,Ha! So much for your brother's fancy-pants technology.
00:29:14.294,00:29:17.256,Steve and Dad racked their brains but said it's impossible.
00:29:17.256,00:29:18.591,"Is it, now?"
00:29:18.591,00:29:20.884,Missed a child.
00:29:20.884,00:29:22.720,Sends shivers down me shins.
00:29:22.720,00:29:32.396,"In two hours, she's gonna wake up tear downstairs, search under the tree and the look on her face."
00:29:33.897,00:29:36.816,But there's nothing there.
00:29:36.816,00:29:38.652,She won't understand.
00:29:36.816,00:29:42.989,She'll think she's the one kid in the world that Santa doesn't care about.
00:29:42.989,00:29:44.908,She'll feel so...
00:29:45.951,00:29:47.453,...left out.
00:29:50.914,00:29:53.875,"On Christmas night, he comes."
00:29:53.875,00:29:56.836,Gwen can't not have a present from Santa.
00:29:56.836,00:29:59.881,"Do you know, Arthur, there is a way."
00:29:59.881,00:30:01.592,It's impossible.
00:30:01.592,00:30:05.262,They used to say it was impossible to teach women to read.
00:30:05.262,00:30:06.972,Follow me.
00:30:39.879,00:30:43.342,It's-- It's the actual sleigh.
00:30:43.342,00:30:45.218,"Hello, Evie."
00:30:45.218,00:30:47.012,I thought it was scrapped years ago.
00:30:47.012,00:30:49.931,So did everyone else.
00:30:51.391,00:30:56.188,Icelandic birch. Arctic balsa.
00:30:56.188,00:31:01.109,"Able to reach 50,000 miles per hour at a height of 40,000 feet."
00:31:01.109,00:31:03.529,"GRANDSANTA: Over here, you string of tinsel."
00:31:03.529,00:31:05.197,Got it.
00:31:05.197,00:31:08.742,Potash of carboniloroxy amilocitrate.
00:31:10.118,00:31:11.787,Magic dust.
00:31:11.787,00:31:14.748,Mined from the aurora borealis.
00:31:14.748,00:31:19.545,But she doesn't still... go?
00:31:19.545,00:31:21.087,Ha.
00:31:23.340,00:31:25.217,"Not just a hobby, Arthur."
00:31:25.217,00:31:29.763,Great-great-grandchildren of the original eight.
00:31:38.313,00:31:41.316,Dasher.
00:31:41.316,00:31:42.609,Wow. Heh.
00:31:42.609,00:31:44.027,Dancer.
00:31:44.027,00:31:45.612,Prancer.
00:31:45.612,00:31:47.614,Uh...
00:31:47.614,00:31:50.826,I could never ruddy remember.
00:31:50.826,00:31:53.370,"You there, with the white ear. And you."
00:31:53.370,00:31:56.540,"And-- Not you, you bag of fleas."
00:31:56.540,00:31:58.250,Arthur?
00:31:58.250,00:32:00.252,I'm not really good with big animals.
00:32:00.252,00:32:01.837,Piffle!
00:32:01.837,00:32:04.297,"Don't get bit, mind."
00:32:04.297,00:32:07.175,Let's hitch them up.
00:32:07.175,00:32:10.679,"Uh, uh-- Excuse me."
00:32:10.679,00:32:12.681,You can go to Gwen!
00:32:12.681,00:32:16.894,"On the old sleigh, with the reindeer and the magic dust and everything!"
00:32:16.894,00:32:18.353,It's a miracle.
00:32:18.353,00:32:20.439,"You're coming too, lad."
00:32:20.439,00:32:22.315,Me?
00:32:22.315,00:32:26.361,On that? Up there?
00:32:26.361,00:32:28.864,No. No way.
00:32:28.864,00:32:30.866,I'm 136.
00:32:30.866,00:32:33.326,"I can't do it on me own, I need an elf."
00:32:33.326,00:32:34.994,I can't fly a sleigh.
00:32:34.994,00:32:38.081,I can't even ride a bike without stabilizers.
00:32:38.081,00:32:39.875,"I know, let's wake Steve."
00:32:38.081,00:32:43.002,He'll-- No.
00:32:43.002,00:32:46.089,What if he stops us?
00:32:46.089,00:32:50.093,You really care.
00:32:50.093,00:32:52.971,I was Santa too.
00:32:52.971,00:32:59.853,"Think of your dad lying awake, chewing his beard off with worry over this girl."
00:32:59.853,00:33:02.564,Don't you want to help for once?
00:33:02.564,00:33:04.983,Make him proud?
00:33:04.983,00:33:06.985,I can't.
00:33:06.985,00:33:10.447,I just-- I can't.
00:33:10.447,00:33:12.240,"No, I can't."
00:33:28.799,00:33:30.467,Ready?!
00:33:30.467,00:33:33.470,ARTHUR: No! You promise...
00:33:33.470,00:33:35.639,ARTHUR: ...not to go too fast?
00:33:35.639,00:33:38.266,ARTHUR: Or high. Or bumpy.
00:33:38.266,00:33:41.186,I get travel sick.
00:33:41.186,00:33:44.272,Ye baubles.
00:33:47.901,00:33:51.571,Wait! My slippers!
00:33:54.491,00:33:56.493,GRANDSANTA: Dash! Dash!
00:33:56.493,00:33:59.454,Dash!
00:34:04.167,00:34:08.213,See? Who's Santa now?
00:34:08.213,00:34:10.298,Whoo-hoo!
00:34:13.218,00:34:15.971,ARTHUR: Aah! Put me down!
00:34:15.971,00:34:19.558,"What's the matter, boy?"
00:34:22.227,00:34:24.646,They've never flown before.
00:34:24.646,00:34:26.690,Just gotta break them in.
00:34:26.690,00:34:28.149,Now.
00:34:34.031,00:34:35.448,Come away!
00:34:35.448,00:34:36.909,Dash away!
00:34:50.338,00:34:54.009,"Look, Arthur."
00:34:54.009,00:34:55.468,We're one of them now.
00:34:55.468,00:34:58.555,A shooting star!
00:34:59.890,00:35:02.935,Stuck that there for your dad when he was a boy.
00:35:02.935,00:35:05.020,"Dad? What, he sat here?"
00:35:05.020,00:35:06.646,So did I.
00:35:06.646,00:35:10.233,Every young heir to the Pole gets took out by his father.
00:35:10.233,00:35:13.236,Right back to Saint Nick.
00:35:14.613,00:35:21.202,"We Clauses used to be the only men in the world who could fly, Arthur, and see all this."
00:35:21.202,00:35:26.792,"It was a gift, a great big ball wrapped in oceans and mountains."
00:35:26.792,00:35:30.629,I remember the look on your father's face when he saw it.
00:35:32.422,00:35:34.091,Yah!
00:36:07.958,00:36:10.293,Fish!
00:36:10.293,00:36:12.211,With horns!
00:36:13.630,00:36:15.173,Want to help me make a snowman?
00:36:15.173,00:36:17.425,Yah!
00:36:17.425,00:36:20.095,Aah! Aah!
00:36:27.477,00:36:29.521,Whoa!
00:36:29.521,00:36:31.648,Whoo-hoo!
00:36:33.483,00:36:34.734,Could Dad do that?
00:36:34.734,00:36:36.486,Did he make a snowman for Steve?
00:36:36.486,00:36:38.071,Robot Roy?
00:36:38.071,00:36:39.739,Ha! I should cocoa.
00:36:39.739,00:36:42.492,"The next Santa, and he's never even sat in a sleigh."
00:36:42.492,00:36:43.869,Oi!
00:36:45.411,00:36:48.373,Is that...?
00:36:48.373,00:36:51.292,Used every Christmas night in history.
00:36:51.292,00:36:56.798,"Whatever your brother says, Arthur, it's the same old world."
00:37:02.137,00:37:03.471,ARTHUR: What is it?!
00:37:03.471,00:37:05.724,No idea.
00:37:05.724,00:37:07.392,ARTHUR: It's a city!
00:37:07.392,00:37:10.645,Ruddy cheek. They're always putting these things up.
00:37:10.645,00:37:13.732,I remember the first time I ran into Chicago.
00:37:13.732,00:37:15.817,"Ha, ha."
00:37:15.817,00:37:18.737,"GRANDSANTA: Whoa! Now, where are we?"
00:37:19.779,00:37:21.614,"Ah. Here we are, see?"
00:37:21.614,00:37:23.575,"Oh, no, that's Peking."
00:37:23.575,00:37:25.160,"Ahead, there's a--!"
00:37:25.160,00:37:27.537,GRANDSANTA: Whoa!
00:37:27.537,00:37:29.539,ARTHUR: They can see us.
00:37:29.539,00:37:31.708,"Well, pull the camouflage lever."
00:37:31.708,00:37:34.377,"Now, then, we'd better draw in a few skyscratchers."
00:37:34.377,00:37:37.505,"Just, uh..."
00:37:37.505,00:37:40.675,"That's a steam train, you ninny."
00:37:40.675,00:37:42.719,ARTHUR: Do this one.
00:37:42.719,00:37:46.514,"GRANDSANTA: So, what do they call this place?"
00:37:46.514,00:37:48.433,Toronto.
00:37:48.433,00:37:49.809,Toronto's in Canada.
00:37:49.809,00:37:53.063,The Santas always come through Canada.
00:37:53.063,00:37:56.315,Nobody lives here.
00:37:57.609,00:38:02.321,"Till your brother came with his You can't cut through Saigon, there's a war rubbish."
00:38:02.321,00:38:04.116,Don't need him to tell me what's ahead.
00:38:04.116,00:38:05.617,I got eyes.
00:38:11.581,00:38:14.709,"Ye baubles, an elf."
00:38:14.709,00:38:17.963,"There's a small trauma to your giftwrap, but I can fix it."
00:38:17.963,00:38:19.672,A stowaway!
00:38:17.963,00:38:22.801,"I can wrap anything, sir, with three bits of sticky tape. Three!"
00:38:22.801,00:38:24.552,Good. Wrap yourself a parachute.
00:38:24.552,00:38:26.179,Aah!
00:38:29.266,00:38:31.810,BRYONY: Aah!
00:38:39.317,00:38:41.486,Toronto.
00:38:41.486,00:38:42.988,"Not quite, sir."
00:38:42.988,00:38:45.240,You've lost one of the reindeer.
00:38:54.082,00:38:57.585,Quantitative-- Hello?
00:38:57.585,00:38:59.045,What elf?
00:38:59.045,00:39:01.173,"The crazy wrapping elf, you know?"
00:39:01.173,00:39:03.133,Security tracked her to Sector 19.
00:39:03.133,00:39:05.551,And we think Arthur was here.
00:39:05.551,00:39:07.012,Arthur?
00:39:07.012,00:39:09.514,"Who else leaves the door open, huh, sir?"
00:39:09.514,00:39:10.849,The old sleigh barn?
00:39:10.849,00:39:17.522,That was sealed up decades ago after that terrible night Grandsanta sneaked out and...
00:39:17.522,00:39:21.026,Thank goodness he's too old these days to get into trouble.
00:39:23.987,00:39:27.406,"Bash it with a brick, Arthur."
00:39:27.406,00:39:31.161,ARTHUR: It just won't-- Grab its antlers and tug.
00:39:31.161,00:39:35.081,"I may just be a wrapping operative, sir, but this contravenes."
00:39:35.081,00:39:38.210,Specific mission regulations.
00:39:38.210,00:39:40.753,"I'm in charge here, not Billy the Bureaucrat."
00:39:40.753,00:39:42.255,ARTHUR: It's stuck.
00:39:44.465,00:39:45.967,GRANDSANTA: Shh!
00:39:45.967,00:39:47.219,Eighteen.
00:39:47.219,00:39:49.428,"Elf, wrap your head."
00:39:49.428,00:39:51.389,"Come on, lad."
00:39:51.389,00:39:54.017,You're as much use as a cheese chopstick.
00:39:54.017,00:39:56.936,"Got it! Ah! Oh, no."
00:39:58.688,00:40:01.066,"Oh, my big Aunt Betty."
00:40:01.066,00:40:02.942,It'll have to do.
00:40:02.942,00:40:05.737,What?
00:40:05.737,00:40:08.740,I have about nine seconds left before I black out.
00:40:08.740,00:40:11.450,One breath.
00:40:11.450,00:40:13.078,BRYONY: Sir?
00:40:13.078,00:40:15.454,I said one.
00:40:16.956,00:40:18.708,But don't we need a whole one?
00:40:18.708,00:40:21.753,"You know, to balance the sleigh?"
00:40:21.753,00:40:23.755,"Oh, it won't balance the sleigh."
00:40:23.755,00:40:25.924,"If anything, it'll slow us down."
00:40:27.466,00:40:29.719,So why are we taking it?
00:40:29.719,00:40:33.098,It's for Gwen.
00:40:33.098,00:40:34.432,That's what she's dreaming of.
00:40:34.432,00:40:36.559,"The jingly bells, the sleigh on the roof."
00:40:36.559,00:40:41.064,"Yeah, but-- That's what the kids want, not some spaceship."
00:40:41.064,00:40:43.649,We're giving her the star treatment.
00:40:43.649,00:40:45.068,What now?
00:40:45.068,00:40:47.237,"We have a waker, sir."
00:40:47.237,00:40:48.780,With a gun!
00:40:50.282,00:40:51.908,"That's it, lad."
00:40:51.908,00:40:53.492,ARTHUR: Grandsanta!
00:40:53.492,00:40:58.873,ARTHUR: Uh-- Uh-- Uh-- We come in peace.
00:40:58.873,00:41:04.421,Our craft has to travel around the world in less than an hour!
00:41:07.215,00:41:13.138,ARTHUR: We need a sign for our slei-- Craft.
00:41:13.138,00:41:14.806,Sorry I can't pay you.
00:41:14.806,00:41:17.767,"Where I come from, we don't have money!"
00:41:29.446,00:41:33.158,"GRANDSANTA: Christmas 1923, had a heart attack at the reins."
00:41:33.158,00:41:35.618,Left ventricle popped out me mouth.
00:41:35.618,00:41:37.495,Pushed it back down and carried on!
00:41:39.705,00:41:41.124,"It's big, isn't it, the Atlantic?"
00:41:41.124,00:41:43.668,Think we should stop and ask someone?
00:41:43.668,00:41:46.087,"Pishywibble, we're nearly there!"
00:41:46.087,00:41:50.091,"See, I take the North Star there as a fixed point."
00:41:50.091,00:41:52.844,"Then I plot my bearings from, um..."
00:41:52.844,00:41:54.304,"That's a plane, sir."
00:41:54.304,00:41:56.514,Insubordination.
00:41:56.514,00:41:59.017,ARTHUR: I thought it would be chillier near England.
00:41:59.017,00:42:00.893,GRANDSANTA: Globular warming.
00:42:00.893,00:42:04.939,Ha! Land ahoy!
00:42:07.484,00:42:09.361,"ARTHUR: Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:42:09.361,00:42:11.737,GRANDSANTA: There you are. Down.
00:42:11.737,00:42:13.698,There you go. Ah.
00:42:17.535,00:42:19.412,ARTHUR: Wow.
00:42:19.412,00:42:20.830,England.
00:42:22.165,00:42:23.916,Maybe we pulled to the right a bit.
00:42:23.916,00:42:25.418,We're a reindeer short.
00:42:25.418,00:42:27.545,France. Bonjour.
00:42:31.549,00:42:33.510,They have elephants in France?
00:42:33.510,00:42:36.471,The odd stray.
00:42:36.471,00:42:38.014,This way.
00:42:44.979,00:42:46.772,Paris Zoo.
00:42:48.649,00:42:50.943,BRYONY: Then this is where they keep the lions!
00:42:52.611,00:42:55.948,They won't eat me.
00:42:55.948,00:42:58.910,"Lie down! Oh, right."
00:42:58.910,00:43:00.912,ARTHUR: How old is this?
00:43:00.912,00:43:02.747,Here be cannibals?
00:43:02.747,00:43:03.998,Watch out for cannibals.
00:43:06.292,00:43:08.044,"This isn't France, is it?"
00:43:08.044,00:43:09.795,"Technically, it's known as Africa. Aah!"
00:43:09.795,00:43:12.131,"Serengeti National Park, Tanzania."
00:43:12.131,00:43:13.883,How can you possibly be sure?
00:43:13.883,00:43:15.552,The GPS on my HOHO.
00:43:15.552,00:43:17.636,Take her!
00:43:17.636,00:43:19.180,GPS? Why didn't you say?
00:43:19.180,00:43:21.558,I'm a wrapping elf.
00:43:21.558,00:43:23.560,I use it to store pictures of bows.
00:43:23.560,00:43:26.438,She's right.
00:43:26.438,00:43:28.189,I've seen it on a stamp.
00:43:29.690,00:43:32.860,"I'm too young to die, Arthur."
00:43:32.860,00:43:34.862,Arthur!
00:43:40.076,00:43:43.955,STEVE: The old sleigh.
00:43:43.955,00:43:46.707,Was supposed to be chopped up for firewood decades ago.
00:43:46.707,00:43:48.960,How did that devious--?
00:43:48.960,00:43:51.629,Shall I get you your stress ball?
00:43:51.629,00:43:59.929,"We have finer comms than the Pentagon, and you say we can't contact him except by some ancient-- ERNIE: Toodle-loo!"
00:43:59.929,00:44:01.806,Here comes the cavalry!
00:44:01.806,00:44:03.766,"Ernie Clicker, sir."
00:44:03.766,00:44:09.021,Head of Polar Communications for 46 missions!
00:44:09.021,00:44:14.026,"Oh, crikey blikey, me and your granddad saw some times!"
00:44:14.026,00:44:18.239,"I remember once-- Wow, must catch up soon. Now..."
00:44:18.239,00:44:22.660,"Oh, you're in a hurry."
00:44:27.081,00:44:29.250,"Oh, this is ridiculous."
00:44:29.250,00:44:33.338,Ooh... You can't rush the Signalator.
00:44:33.338,00:44:35.256,Got to play her gentle.
00:44:36.591,00:44:39.093,"So, what do you wish to say?"
00:44:39.093,00:44:40.761,I wouldn't worry.
00:44:40.761,00:44:44.307,It's not like they're facing man-eating lions.
00:45:15.213,00:45:42.323,ALL: GRANDSANTA: Dash!
00:45:44.659,00:45:46.911,Something's coming through.
00:45:46.911,00:45:48.329,What does it say?
00:45:52.291,00:45:54.877,GRANDSANTA: Get off! No!
00:45:54.877,00:45:56.462,"That's me Evie, you mangy moron!"
00:45:58.631,00:46:00.799,ARTHUR: No! That's Gwen's gift!
00:46:00.799,00:46:02.176,Hi-yah!
00:46:02.176,00:46:05.012,Only children get to tear the wrapping.
00:46:05.012,00:46:07.223,Bryony?
00:46:07.223,00:46:10.268,"Down, doggy!"
00:46:10.268,00:46:12.019,Laser-guided scissors!
00:46:13.354,00:46:15.022,"Oh, no, no!"
00:46:16.315,00:46:19.318,Standard-issue giftwrap!
00:46:19.318,00:46:21.613,There's always time for a bow!
00:46:21.613,00:46:25.366,ARTHUR: Oh!
00:46:25.366,00:46:27.452,Not that knob!
00:46:27.452,00:46:28.827,"Oh, no!"
00:46:29.912,00:46:31.330,ARTHUR: Something else!
00:46:31.330,00:46:33.916,"No, leave it! Don't-- Aah."
00:46:34.917,00:46:37.002,My camera!
00:46:50.141,00:46:52.226,Wait! Look!
00:46:53.728,00:46:55.062,Oi!
00:47:15.874,00:47:17.543,BRYONY: Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:47:17.543,00:47:18.877,Wow.
00:47:27.637,00:47:28.845,Whoa!
00:47:28.845,00:47:30.306,GRANDSANTA: What's so funny?
00:47:30.306,00:47:32.933,Look what they've done to my Evie.
00:47:32.933,00:47:35.478,And the map.
00:47:35.478,00:47:36.895,We've got this. Look!
00:47:36.895,00:47:39.064,"Mimosa Avenue, Trelew."
00:47:39.064,00:47:41.275,Proceed to the highlighted route.
00:47:41.275,00:47:43.277,What's the point?
00:47:43.277,00:47:45.321,"And my camera, totally banjaxed."
00:47:45.321,00:47:47.448,How do I get my picture now?
00:47:47.448,00:47:49.033,What picture?
00:47:49.033,00:47:55.247,"The sleigh on the roof, the eight beautiful reindeer and Santa-- Me!"
00:47:55.247,00:47:57.166,That's what I wanted them to see.
00:47:57.166,00:48:01.045,"They missed the kid, but I got there. My way."
00:48:02.421,00:48:06.592,That's why you came.
00:48:08.219,00:48:11.681,"1,368 miles, then slight left."
00:48:13.265,00:48:17.770,"For the love of Lulu, bossed about by Tinpot Tom."
00:48:17.770,00:48:19.772,Dash!
00:48:19.772,00:48:21.940,Try them again.
00:48:21.940,00:48:24.485,All this for one child.
00:48:24.485,00:48:26.779,We should turn her off a mo.
00:48:26.779,00:48:28.698,"Don't worry, sir."
00:48:28.698,00:48:33.952,Either it won't know it got missed or it'll think it's been bad.
00:48:33.952,00:48:37.289,You missed one?
00:48:37.289,00:48:41.335,"Ha, ha. What's all this here for if you miss one?"
00:48:41.335,00:48:43.546,Could you please type faster?
00:48:43.546,00:48:45.130,All right.
00:48:46.298,00:48:48.175,COMPUTER: Systems critical.
00:48:48.175,00:48:50.135,Lead in Christmas.
00:48:55.892,00:48:57.393,ERNIE: Oops-a-daisy.
00:48:57.393,00:49:01.230,"STEVE: Peter, let go of my hand, please."
00:49:01.230,00:49:03.900,"PETER: Yes, sir. Sorry, sir."
00:49:03.900,00:49:06.527,And get me IT.
00:49:08.613,00:49:11.115,"Descend 1,000 feet."
00:49:13.576,00:49:16.746,You are at your destination.
00:49:16.746,00:49:19.373,"We did it, we did it!"
00:49:19.373,00:49:21.333,Whoopee-doo.
00:49:21.333,00:49:23.920,"In 100 yards, turn left."
00:49:23.920,00:49:25.588,"Straight ahead, left, right."
00:49:25.588,00:49:27.298,You are at your client's dwelling.
00:49:27.298,00:49:29.216,"Whoa, whoa!"
00:49:34.472,00:49:36.724,We made it.
00:49:38.142,00:49:46.317,"I'll walk home, I'll get a boat, but I am never getting back in that crazy flying death trap ever again!"
00:49:48.026,00:49:50.529,Go on. Get it over.
00:49:50.529,00:49:52.072,I want my bed.
00:49:53.282,00:49:54.826,"What, you're not coming?"
00:49:57.202,00:50:00.164,You have to deliver the present.
00:50:00.164,00:50:02.040,You've got your special coat on.
00:50:02.040,00:50:03.626,You're our Santa.
00:50:03.626,00:50:07.045,"I said me and Evie could get here, and we did."
00:50:07.045,00:50:09.423,The rest is just elf work.
00:50:09.423,00:50:13.302,"Go on, Festive Freddie, sling your hook."
00:50:16.639,00:50:19.141,It doesn't matter how we got here.
00:50:19.141,00:50:24.104,"The sleigh on the roof, the jingle bells, the eight reindeer."
00:50:24.104,00:50:26.774,Gwen would never have seen that.
00:50:45.459,00:50:48.212,I wish Dad could see this.
00:50:48.212,00:50:50.631,It would take such a load off his mind.
00:50:50.631,00:50:53.175,"So, what are your orders?"
00:50:53.175,00:50:54.510,Hmm?
00:50:54.510,00:50:57.596,You're a Claus.
00:50:57.596,00:51:00.516,Do I? Oh!
00:51:00.516,00:51:01.976,"I'm just happy being an elf, really."
00:51:01.976,00:51:03.936,"You know, just part of it all."
00:51:05.479,00:51:07.732,You want to order me to go through the cat flap?
00:51:07.732,00:51:10.066,Oh! Um...
00:51:11.903,00:51:14.238,Do you want to tell me to let you in?
00:51:14.238,00:51:17.115,Brilliant.
00:51:17.115,00:51:19.410,BRYONY: And do you want to--?
00:51:19.410,00:51:22.120,Quick!
00:51:54.612,00:51:56.989,Is this your first time?
00:52:16.801,00:52:29.396,But-- Bryony?
00:52:34.234,00:52:35.778,Sorry.
00:52:35.778,00:52:37.822,He likes these slippers even more than you do!
00:52:45.161,00:52:46.538,Happy Christmas.
00:52:48.290,00:52:51.669,"When you put the address into the HOHO, what did you see?"
00:52:51.669,00:52:53.337,A list of Trelews.
00:52:53.337,00:52:54.964,I just clicked on the first one!
00:52:54.964,00:52:57.466,"Which was not Trelew, England."
00:52:57.466,00:52:58.717,We're in the wrong Trelew!
00:53:05.474,00:53:07.601,What's going on?!
00:53:07.601,00:53:10.938,They've been watching us.
00:53:10.938,00:53:13.315,It's just like last time.
00:53:13.315,00:53:17.611,Governments tonight are waking to news of a UFO traveling the globe at incredible speed.
00:53:17.611,00:53:19.404,BRYONY: That's us!
00:53:17.611,00:53:21.406,The clearest sighting was at this tractor dealership in Idaho.
00:53:21.406,00:53:26.829,Had eyeballs on its feet and a pointy little head.
00:53:26.829,00:53:28.330,BRYONY: We're on the news.
00:53:28.330,00:53:31.583,"REPORTER: From the trail in Toronto, these beings do not appear friendly."
00:53:31.583,00:53:33.502,COMPUTER: Rebooting.
00:53:33.502,00:53:35.587,"We are online, sir."
00:53:35.587,00:53:39.842,Mexican police found a furry thing trying to mate with a dog.
00:53:37.673,00:53:41.510,MAN 1: I have calls reporting a steam train flying around.
00:53:41.510,00:53:43.637,MAN 2: Steam train?
00:53:43.637,00:53:45.514,MAN 3: It's gone black over Mexico.
00:53:45.514,00:53:47.933,This thing's going faster than anything we know of.
00:53:47.933,00:53:49.894,STEVE: No.
00:53:47.933,00:53:54.314,"The herd is now in Mozambique's airspace, threatening the fragile peace between the two nations."
00:53:54.314,00:53:57.860,"Two billion items delivered, and we didn't leave a footprint in the snow."
00:53:57.860,00:53:59.361,And now-- DOUG: Sir?
00:53:59.361,00:54:01.906,We have lost 80 percent of our data.
00:54:01.906,00:54:03.866,"No, no."
00:54:01.906,00:54:05.576,We have 18 pulse data reservoirs of a trillion terabytes!
00:54:05.576,00:54:08.453,"Sorry, autosave was off."
00:54:08.453,00:54:10.330,"Shall I slap him, sir?"
00:54:10.330,00:54:13.542,"Sir, there's a polar bear on Level 6."
00:54:13.542,00:54:16.754,Sir? Why is Arthur out there?
00:54:16.754,00:54:18.172,ERNIE: He missed one.
00:54:18.172,00:54:19.715,A nipper.
00:54:19.715,00:54:23.552,"I mean, 47785BXK."
00:54:26.805,00:54:28.682,"Sir, we've got something."
00:54:28.682,00:54:31.435,"Bryony Shelfley, it's her HOHO."
00:54:35.940,00:54:37.357,We can still get there.
00:54:37.357,00:54:39.235,"We just have to go faster, higher!"
00:54:39.235,00:54:40.945,You've changed your tune.
00:54:40.945,00:54:42.654,I'm not going anywhere.
00:54:42.654,00:54:44.156,I'm not here!
00:54:44.156,00:54:46.282,ARTHUR: I've taped myself in!
00:54:46.282,00:54:49.536,Leave me. It's that terrible night all over again.
00:54:49.536,00:54:50.662,What night?
00:54:50.662,00:54:52.539,Last time I took Evie for a spin.
00:54:52.539,00:54:54.499,I didn't know it was the Cuban missile crisis!
00:54:54.499,00:54:57.461,I nearly started World War III.
00:54:59.295,00:55:01.339,BRYONY: Hold still.
00:55:02.674,00:55:03.842,Whoopsie!
00:55:03.842,00:55:05.261,"ARTHUR: Oh, no!"
00:55:05.261,00:55:07.221,Fencer! Mincer!
00:55:08.847,00:55:10.348,Bryony!
00:55:10.348,00:55:12.268,BRYONY: Hi-yah!
00:55:14.979,00:55:16.730,"ARTHUR: Grandsanta, get here!"
00:55:16.730,00:55:19.233,Oi! That's me new hip.
00:55:19.233,00:55:22.318,"Please, I'll read you Gwen's letter."
00:55:22.318,00:55:24.905,Stone-deaf. I'm 136.
00:55:24.905,00:55:26.698,What's that?
00:55:26.698,00:55:28.867,Steve!
00:55:28.867,00:55:31.245,Grandsanta says he's not here.
00:55:31.245,00:55:34.372,Hi. I'm looking for a missing relic.
00:55:34.372,00:55:35.874,"Steve, three words."
00:55:35.874,00:55:37.542,Is the first one help?
00:55:37.542,00:55:39.544,"You can help us, Steve!"
00:55:39.544,00:55:41.755,Frosty the Madman.
00:55:41.755,00:55:43.590,"Elf, back me up if you want a career."
00:55:43.590,00:55:46.093,I forced you?
00:55:46.093,00:55:48.804,"What did you want, Grandsanta?"
00:55:48.804,00:55:53.349,A picture of you in the sleigh delivering the gift to show me how it's really done?
00:55:53.349,00:55:54.977,No.
00:55:54.977,00:55:56.687,You know the picture they'll have tomorrow?
00:55:56.687,00:55:58.605,"You, led away in handcuffs!"
00:55:58.605,00:56:01.692,The Santa who was seen.
00:56:01.692,00:56:03.694,The Santa who ruined Christmas.
00:56:03.694,00:56:05.403,Ruined it!
00:56:05.403,00:56:07.281,"We'll fix this, Steve."
00:56:05.403,00:56:09.325,We'll be back home in the wobble of a reindeer's buttocks.
00:56:09.325,00:56:11.285,And Evie can go back in mothballs.
00:56:11.285,00:56:13.245,You can forget she ever existed.
00:56:13.245,00:56:16.456,You can't just go home.
00:56:16.456,00:56:19.459,"Gwen. For that, you'd threaten my whole operation?"
00:56:19.459,00:56:22.921,"Steve, you said if there was any way to get there, you would."
00:56:22.921,00:56:24.798,"Well, this is it. Look."
00:56:24.798,00:56:26.342,The old sleigh is perfect!
00:56:26.342,00:56:30.721,"Uh, right. Well, anyway, it goes really fast, even with bits missing."
00:56:30.721,00:56:32.890,And we've got quite a few reindeer left.
00:56:32.890,00:56:35.893,"And, if I'm sick again, I could be sick in a bag."
00:56:35.893,00:56:38.020,I'll wrap him one.
00:56:38.020,00:56:40.438,We can help them.
00:56:40.438,00:56:43.192,"All correct presents, present and correct."
00:56:43.192,00:56:46.695,"ARTHUR: If you help us, Steve, we can do it!"
00:56:51.700,00:56:55.704,"THOMAS: Grandsanta and Arthur would be the heroes of the night, sir!"
00:56:58.332,00:57:00.125,Come home now!
00:57:00.125,00:57:04.046,"If we all just gave in to Christmas spirit, there'd be chaos."
00:57:04.046,00:57:06.422,"Unh! We're on our way, Steve."
00:57:06.422,00:57:08.967,Santa will want us to get to Gwen.
00:57:08.967,00:57:12.388,Ask him. Please.
00:57:12.388,00:57:15.849,"Arthur, this is Dad we're talking about."
00:57:15.849,00:57:23.274,"There was a time when he cared about every last gift tag, but now he just wants to be loved and get some rest."
00:57:23.274,00:57:28.904,"No. He's lying awake, worrying his beard off about Gwen."
00:57:30.406,00:57:33.491,SANTA: Ho-ho-ho.
00:57:33.491,00:57:36.203,Please do not disturb until December 26th.
00:57:36.203,00:57:37.829,"Is that it, dear?"
00:57:37.829,00:57:42.376,Press the red-- No.
00:57:42.376,00:57:45.129,Santa's the most caring man in the world.
00:57:45.129,00:57:48.882,"So why are you here, not him?"
00:58:11.280,00:58:13.907,"GRANDSANTA: Don't leave me, Arthur!"
00:58:13.907,00:58:18.745,"Poor old man and his reindeer, on our own at Christmas?"
00:58:18.745,00:58:22.791,At least have the decency to finish us off with a rock!
00:58:58.076,00:59:00.204,Poor Evie.
00:59:03.248,00:59:05.501,Sun'll be up soon.
00:59:05.501,00:59:07.878,It's Christmas!
00:59:07.878,00:59:09.921,Christmas is for kids.
00:59:09.921,00:59:11.256,You grow out of it.
00:59:11.256,00:59:14.009,"What, in the last six minutes?"
00:59:14.009,00:59:16.970,"I know what you all say about me, you know."
00:59:18.555,00:59:21.141,He belongs in the South Pole.
00:59:21.141,00:59:25.603,"Dear Arthur, what a puzzle."
00:59:26.897,00:59:29.107,"Well, you were right."
00:59:29.107,00:59:32.069,All that fuss over one kid.
00:59:32.069,00:59:34.905,I was being ridiculous.
00:59:36.614,00:59:38.242,This is nice.
00:59:38.242,00:59:41.328,"It's good to get away from it all, you know."
00:59:41.328,00:59:43.372,All the Christmas fuss.
00:59:51.629,00:59:55.675,"I'm sorry I messed things up, lad."
00:59:55.675,01:00:06.311,"You see, the night I last took Evie out when there was all that fuss, your father came to me."
01:00:06.311,01:00:08.105,I'll never forget it.
01:00:08.105,01:00:10.607,Couldn't look me in the eye.
01:00:10.607,01:00:13.068,"Dad, he says."
01:00:13.068,01:00:16.863,Steve thinks it best you don't fly again.
01:00:18.073,01:00:21.826,We're scrapping the sleigh.
01:00:21.826,01:00:27.707,"Me own son who used to sit where you sat, looking up at me."
01:00:30.586,01:00:36.216,I just wanted them to remember who I used to be.
01:00:38.135,01:00:43.098,"I was a bit like you, lad."
01:00:43.098,01:00:46.017,So was your dad.
01:00:46.017,01:00:48.145,"You get old, that's all."
01:00:48.145,01:00:51.231,Everything changes.
01:00:51.231,01:00:52.774,Does it?
01:00:54.276,01:00:58.905,How can I ever write another letter saying that Santa cares?
01:01:06.871,01:01:08.873,"Good night, Dad."
01:01:09.874,01:01:11.251,Sleep well.
01:01:18.800,01:01:20.511,Oh!
01:01:20.511,01:01:24.055,"Sir, we know you shouldn't believe rumors, but we do."
01:01:24.055,01:01:25.890,Is it true you missed a child?
01:01:25.890,01:01:28.226,"Me? No, no, no."
01:01:28.226,01:01:30.854,"Well, uh, in a way, yes."
01:01:32.648,01:01:33.982,It was just one.
01:01:33.982,01:01:36.026,"In fact, not even that."
01:01:36.026,01:01:41.114,"Naught point lots more naughts, then a number and some sort of percent at the end."
01:01:41.114,01:01:44.451,"Not really an error, just a one."
01:01:44.451,01:01:47.245,One child doesn't matter?
01:01:47.245,01:01:48.997,"Well, I..."
01:01:47.245,01:01:50.832,It's not that-- SEB: I did nine ones in Greece.
01:01:50.832,01:01:52.083,Did those matter?
01:01:52.083,01:01:53.502,What about my ones in Germany?
01:01:53.502,01:01:55.170,One of them was twins!
01:01:55.170,01:01:56.754,They don't matter half each.
01:01:56.754,01:01:58.882,Um...
01:01:58.882,01:02:01.385,He can explain.
01:02:01.385,01:02:04.137,"But aren't you in charge, sir?"
01:02:04.137,01:02:05.805,Of course.
01:02:05.805,01:02:07.724,I'm Santa.
01:02:07.724,01:02:14.731,"Sir, if the one that got missed doesn't matter, why have Arthur and Grandsanta gone to take it?"
01:02:14.731,01:02:15.982,What?
01:02:15.982,01:02:20.237,"Malcolm, what's this about Arthur?"
01:02:21.405,01:02:23.240,ELF 1: He's crazy.
01:02:23.240,01:02:25.576,DEBORAH: Is there a list of children who don't matter?
01:02:25.576,01:02:27.703,Santa said they don't matter 100 percent.
01:02:27.703,01:02:30.664,"ELF 2: Is it true children aren't real, they're just antimatter?"
01:02:30.664,01:02:33.041,"Shh, shh!"
01:02:33.041,01:02:36.044,I festivized every single country in the world.
01:02:36.044,01:02:39.756,"You see? This one, this one, this one. All of them."
01:02:39.756,01:02:43.009,"I mean, who cares about one single tiny child?"
01:02:45.762,01:02:47.972,Uh... I do.
01:02:47.972,01:02:50.350,Arthur.
01:02:50.350,01:02:52.728,My poor boy.
01:02:52.728,01:02:55.063,Why on earth would he--?
01:02:55.063,01:02:58.983,"You're his brother, Steve."
01:02:58.983,01:03:06.032,"And about this child you missed, I'm really not sure you made the right decision."
01:03:08.243,01:03:11.413,Is that bird doo on your shoulder?
01:03:11.413,01:03:12.914,Right.
01:03:12.914,01:03:17.001,"Over there is Satellite Tracking, Navigation, Data Analysis."
01:03:17.001,01:03:21.298,Coffee machine's by the door.
01:03:31.224,01:03:32.850,SANTA: Um...
01:03:34.185,01:03:35.937,I'll be right back.
01:04:14.184,01:04:18.647,"ARTHUR: Dear Xiao-Ling, thanks for your letter and drawing of Santa tripping over your dog."
01:04:18.647,01:04:19.815,It was hilarious.
01:04:19.815,01:04:25.403,"Dear Alessandro, I'm sorry your family's had a hard year, but Santa is real."
01:04:25.403,01:04:30.033,"Dear Lars, I promise Santa will come."
01:04:30.033,01:04:32.661,He's the greatest man ever.
01:04:51.304,01:04:54.224,Can I burn this?
01:04:54.224,01:04:56.476,Ah. There's millions like it.
01:05:18.373,01:05:20.375,This picture.
01:05:20.375,01:05:23.670,This drawing!
01:05:23.670,01:05:29.217,It isn't of Dad or you or Steve.
01:05:31.428,01:05:35.181,"This is Santa! Ha, ha!"
01:05:35.181,01:05:40.978,"And as long we get the bike to Gwen before she wakes up, then Santa came!"
01:05:40.978,01:05:44.274,And he cares!
01:05:48.904,01:05:50.405,Excuse!
01:05:50.405,01:05:58.079,ARTHUR: Wah-hey!
01:06:00.540,01:06:08.632,"ARTHUR: GRANDSANTA: Oh, dear."
01:06:08.632,01:06:10.717,I've seen this before.
01:06:10.717,01:06:12.594,"Sleigh fever, they call it."
01:06:12.594,01:06:15.764,Pressure of Christmas sends a man doolally-tap.
01:06:15.764,01:06:18.850,"Santa Claus XVI got it, 1802."
01:06:18.850,01:06:22.145,Every child that year got a sausage nailed to a piece of bark.
01:06:22.145,01:06:23.521,Unh! Whoa!
01:06:23.521,01:06:28.985,"Arthur, do you really think you can row the Atlantic Ocean in the next 37 minutes?"
01:06:28.985,01:06:33.281,"It's not, unh, too late yet."
01:06:33.281,01:06:36.827,"I just have to keep, unh, going."
01:06:36.827,01:06:38.578,We need a blunt instrument.
01:06:38.578,01:06:40.204,Knock him out and regroup.
01:06:40.204,01:06:45.168,"Make a legal U-turn, then slight right in 4,228 miles."
01:06:45.168,01:06:48.338,You do know we're going round in circles?
01:06:48.338,01:06:51.174,"You know, we're not the only ones."
01:06:51.174,01:06:53.551,Maybe I will see Evie again.
01:06:53.551,01:06:54.970,What do you mean?
01:06:54.970,01:07:00.475,"Reindeer are brave, powerful beasts but they're also dappled cretins with twigs on their heads."
01:07:00.475,01:07:05.188,They'll just keep going in a straight line right round the world.
01:07:05.188,01:07:11.820,"They'll be way up in the sky, flying at unimaginable speed, but they'll pass right over our heads."
01:07:11.820,01:07:14.572,Great!
01:07:18.242,01:07:20.745,Chief De Silva.
01:07:20.745,01:07:22.747,"It's circling the Earth, ma'am."
01:07:22.747,01:07:26.250,"Nineteen minutes ago, it went into orbit."
01:07:26.250,01:07:29.713,You? Up there?
01:07:30.672,01:07:31.882,Magic dust.
01:07:31.882,01:07:33.758,You crack it over your head.
01:07:33.758,01:07:35.760,You'll have to focus.
01:07:33.758,01:07:37.679,"The sleigh'll be coming at you at 45,000 miles an hour."
01:07:37.679,01:07:40.849,"45,000--?"
01:07:40.849,01:07:42.308,Depends on the angle the sleigh hits.
01:07:42.308,01:07:44.310,You might just get beheaded.
01:07:44.310,01:07:50.942,"I've got a phobia of being beheaded, and heights and speed and reindeer and buttons."
01:07:50.942,01:07:52.402,Buttons?
01:07:52.402,01:07:54.529,"Yeah, I'm pretty much scared of everything."
01:07:54.529,01:07:57.866,Gwen thinks you're coming. Ah!
01:07:57.866,01:07:59.409,You can't do this.
01:07:59.409,01:08:00.952,"No, you can't."
01:08:00.952,01:08:02.245,"Come on, Arthur!"
01:08:02.245,01:08:04.121,Don't worry.
01:08:02.245,01:08:06.541,Only a raving lunatic-- I have to worry!
01:08:06.541,01:08:09.002,Ah! Worry me.
01:08:09.002,01:08:10.754,The sleigh'll be back any minute.
01:08:10.754,01:08:13.423,Come on.
01:08:13.423,01:08:19.303,"Imagine Gwen, all alone, nothing under the tree."
01:08:19.303,01:08:21.180,Aah! No! Don't like this!
01:08:21.180,01:08:22.682,Stop! Stop! Stop!
01:08:22.682,01:08:24.976,The tears as she finds she's been left out.
01:08:24.976,01:08:27.186,"Screaming, Santa didn't come!"
01:08:27.186,01:08:30.982,"Oh, Gwen."
01:08:30.982,01:08:38.114,"BRYONY: Gwen in the street surrounded by kids on new bikes, pointing: That's the girl that Santa hates!"
01:08:38.114,01:08:40.784,"She runs away, alcoholic by the age of 9."
01:08:40.784,01:08:42.410,Dead before she's even--!
01:08:42.410,01:08:44.829,She may never build a snowman again!
01:08:46.748,01:08:49.626,What if there are buttons on the sleigh I don't know about?!
01:08:49.626,01:08:51.711,Here it is!
01:09:02.305,01:09:03.681,Um...
01:09:11.106,01:09:13.024,"How do you think he's, uh...?"
01:09:13.024,01:09:16.569,"Fine, fine."
01:09:31.042,01:09:34.629,"So how come they didn't scrap the sleigh, sir?"
01:09:34.629,01:09:36.006,I threatened the elves.
01:09:36.006,01:09:38.424,Said I'd feed them to the polar bears.
01:09:42.512,01:09:44.305,Whoa!
01:09:50.020,01:09:55.441,"Elf, how do you fancy being the one to tell his parents about all this?"
01:10:09.246,01:10:10.915,Whoa! Whoa!
01:10:10.915,01:10:12.291,Whoa!
01:10:27.849,01:10:30.393,Yay! Arthur!
01:10:30.393,01:10:32.353,You did it!
01:10:32.353,01:10:35.023,"Oh, I was sure you'd die."
01:10:35.023,01:10:37.274,Proceed to the highlighted route.
01:10:37.274,01:10:39.318,Proceed to the highlighted.
01:10:40.653,01:10:43.156,Just keep worrying about Gwen.
01:10:43.156,01:10:46.409,"I'll find a way there, boy."
01:10:46.409,01:10:48.536,To Trelew!
01:10:52.331,01:10:55.334,Margaret.
01:10:55.334,01:10:57.128,All sorted.
01:10:55.334,01:11:03.426,"Steve's, uh, holding the fort while I deliver the present, yes, and find Arthur and Father."
01:11:03.426,01:11:05.302,"Well done, dear."
01:11:05.302,01:11:15.772,"Trelew's on a course of 187.7 degrees from the geographic pole but as it's the old sleigh, allow a drift margin of 1,000 miles either side of the meridian."
01:11:13.310,01:11:19.442,"Got a sweater for Arthur, your father's pills, and some nice sweet tea."
01:11:19.442,01:11:20.985,Hm.
01:11:24.948,01:11:26.783,COMPUTER: Curtains.
01:11:29.619,01:11:31.537,S-1 dented.
01:11:31.537,01:11:33.539,Big scratch down side.
01:11:33.539,01:11:36.126,Popped out to take present.
01:11:36.126,01:11:38.169,Turkey sandwich in fridge.
01:11:38.169,01:11:39.837,Espresso machine broken.
01:11:39.837,01:11:43.758,"That idiot, Arthur."
01:11:43.758,01:11:45.426,He'll destroy Christmas.
01:11:45.426,01:11:47.845,And you'll never get to be Santa.
01:11:49.055,01:11:51.141,Steven!
01:11:51.141,01:11:52.892,"I, um..."
01:11:52.892,01:11:55.770,"23 Mimosa Avenue, Trelew."
01:11:55.770,01:12:00.191,"Malcolm, there's no harm in using a manual."
01:12:00.191,01:12:01.609,Men.
01:12:01.609,01:12:03.360,"Margaret, I order you to disembark."
01:12:03.360,01:12:05.029,It's not safe. Unh!
01:12:05.029,01:12:07.782,Piffle. I did a microlight flying course on the Internet.
01:12:07.782,01:12:10.493,It can't be that different.
01:12:10.493,01:12:13.370,Oh! Steve.
01:12:13.370,01:12:16.415,You've dented it!
01:12:16.415,01:12:18.501,"Malcolm, you told me he knew."
01:12:18.501,01:12:20.670,You know how Steve feels about his S-1.
01:12:20.670,01:12:23.339,It's my S-1.
01:12:23.339,01:12:25.424,I'm flying to this child.
01:12:25.424,01:12:27.343,Of course she's all that matters.
01:12:27.343,01:12:28.970,"Not me, your son."
01:12:28.970,01:12:31.472,Not the 2 billion things I did right tonight.
01:12:31.472,01:12:33.766,No!
01:12:33.766,01:12:36.227,"This is about that pool table, isn't it?"
01:12:36.227,01:12:39.063,"I told you, you should've written to me."
01:12:39.063,01:12:41.607,I was 8.
01:12:41.607,01:12:42.984,For goodness sake!
01:12:42.984,01:12:50.158,Arthur and Grandsanta are out there probably not wearing nearly enough layers and you two are bickering over a big red toy?!
01:12:50.158,01:12:51.450,I'm not bickering.
01:12:51.450,01:12:53.661,If Steven could just stand back-- Ooh!
01:12:53.661,01:12:55.330,COMPUTER: Air bag.
01:13:01.460,01:13:03.880,"You drive, Steven."
01:13:03.880,01:13:05.381,Thank you.
01:13:05.381,01:13:13.306,"So since gift delivery to child 47785BXK is all that seems to matter, I'll do it myself."
01:13:13.306,01:13:17.101,Then we'll pick up Arthur and Grandsanta from whatever ditch they ended up in.
01:13:17.101,01:13:18.769,Maximum thrust.
01:13:23.316,01:13:28.779,"Um, when Santa said he'd be right back, what do you think he--?"
01:13:28.779,01:13:30.823,He's not coming back!
01:13:30.823,01:13:32.491,The Santas are leaving!
01:13:32.491,01:13:33.826,Children don't matter?
01:13:33.826,01:13:35.119,Christmas doesn't matter!
01:13:35.119,01:13:38.164,Nothing matters!
01:13:38.164,01:13:39.874,Abandon the North Pole!
01:13:39.874,01:13:42.377,"DEBORAH: Everybody, panic!"

01:14:48.109,01:14:51.862,They burst an inflatable Santa Claus in Toronto.
01:14:51.862,01:14:53.697,WOMAN 2: What a terrible thing.
01:14:53.697,01:14:58.494,"DE SILVA: Let us attempt contact, but be ready to save our planet."

01:15:28.441,01:15:30.026,Alert level six.
01:15:30.026,01:15:32.528,It's coming down through the atmosphere.
01:15:32.528,01:15:35.156,We'll see it.
01:15:32.528,01:15:37.867,"Forty-six, 45, 44, 43."
01:15:37.867,01:15:41.120,"They'll be waiting for us, sir."

01:15:44.499,01:15:47.960,"Oh, come on."
01:15:49.086,01:15:52.089,"Santa mustn't be seen, eh, lad?"
01:15:52.089,01:15:54.842,Let's give them something to shoot at.
01:15:55.926,01:15:58.554,We have visual.
01:16:00.264,01:16:03.559,GRANDSANTA: Take us to your leader.
01:16:03.559,01:16:05.144,England!

01:16:13.444,01:16:14.820,Season's greetings from mankind.
01:16:14.820,01:16:16.406,"Good morning, do you copy?"
01:16:16.406,01:16:18.908,"The hull is some kind of woody substance, ma'am."
01:16:18.908,01:16:20.659,Like wood.
01:16:20.659,01:16:22.661,Coated in lead paint.
01:16:22.661,01:16:24.080,The engine seems to be alive.
01:16:24.080,01:16:25.956,And furry.
01:16:25.956,01:16:27.958,"GRANDSANTA: Come on, lad!"
01:16:27.958,01:16:30.002,Put your back into it!
01:16:31.879,01:16:40.721,ALL: I have something.

01:16:47.353,01:16:48.812,We made it!
01:16:50.856,01:16:52.608,Not quite.
01:16:52.608,01:16:54.944,Dash!
01:16:56.820,01:16:59.115,It's right up me steam pipe!
01:16:59.115,01:17:01.325,It's tracking something electronic!
01:17:01.325,01:17:06.122,We haven't got any electrickery.
01:17:02.701,01:17:07.457,"Just wood and brass and-- Oh, dear."

01:17:13.254,01:17:14.713,They'll see us!
01:17:14.713,01:17:16.257,Give me that.
01:17:16.257,01:17:19.135,What are you doing?
01:17:19.135,01:17:21.596,"She doesn't fit this world, Arthur."
01:17:21.596,01:17:24.098,She's a relic.
01:17:24.098,01:17:28.644,I always knew she'd be needed one more time.
01:17:28.644,01:17:31.730,You go on.
01:17:31.730,01:17:33.316,You're coming too.
01:17:33.316,01:17:34.900,"You were right, Arthur."
01:17:34.900,01:17:37.861,It doesn't matter how Santa's gift gets there.
01:17:37.861,01:17:41.824,Doesn't even matter if it's Mr. Postman in his spaceship.
01:17:41.824,01:17:43.993,As long as it gets there.
01:17:43.993,01:17:47.955,"You made it happen, lad."
01:17:47.955,01:17:49.457,Get off.
01:17:49.457,01:17:50.916,"Now, do as I say."

01:18:04.680,01:18:06.890,Happy Christmas!
01:18:06.890,01:18:09.143,In Santa we believe!
01:18:10.603,01:18:12.896,"Go on, elf. You too."
01:18:13.897,01:18:16.275,Hi-yah!

01:18:19.069,01:18:21.113,"This is it, old fella."
01:18:21.113,01:18:26.536,"Maybe the next Santa never sat in my Evie, but Arthur did."
01:18:26.536,01:18:30.873,And he's as good a man as any Santa there's ever been.
01:18:31.915,01:18:33.709,Yah!
01:18:36.086,01:18:37.547,"Goodbye, Evie."
01:18:43.469,01:18:44.761,"Thank you, everyone."
01:18:44.761,01:18:47.056,You just saved Christmas.
01:18:58.651,01:19:00.486,STEVE: Trelew.
01:19:03.573,01:19:06.659,"Out with the old, in with the new."
01:19:06.659,01:19:08.911,"Well done, dear."
01:19:14.958,01:19:18.795,Poor Arthur.
01:19:18.795,01:19:22.341,He's flunked again.
01:19:22.341,01:19:23.551,We're here.
01:19:23.551,01:19:26.136,The little girl will get her present.
01:19:26.136,01:19:29.181,I think he's done rather splendidly.
01:19:30.224,01:19:31.975,My Margaret.
01:19:34.645,01:19:36.230,"Good morning, Gwen."
01:19:36.230,01:19:38.232,"Ho, ho, et cetera."
01:19:38.232,01:19:39.858,Apologies for the minor delay.
01:19:39.858,01:19:50.661,"I'm sure that even a child can understand that in an operation as complex as Christmas, there's always an insignificant margin of error, which is you."
01:19:48.659,01:19:58.085,"As a gesture, I've upgraded you to the Glamorfast Ultra X-3, which retails at 9.99 more than your requested gift."
01:19:58.085,01:20:00.879,Bigger ergo better.
01:20:00.879,01:20:03.299,If you wouldn't mind just signing a legal waiver?
01:20:08.304,01:20:10.889,Pedro? A boy?
01:20:13.142,01:20:15.144,A Spanish boy?
01:20:15.144,01:20:16.520,This is an error.
01:20:18.230,01:20:20.107,Now get off the bike.
01:20:20.107,01:20:21.317,Will you get--?
01:20:21.317,01:20:23.444,"No, no, no."
01:20:23.444,01:20:25.237,No cry-o.
01:20:28.031,01:20:30.409,"No, uh, sob-idad."
01:20:30.409,01:20:32.495,Uh...
01:20:37.667,01:20:40.419,It's over a mile.
01:20:37.667,01:20:43.506,"We've got no sleigh, no reindeer, and you can't even walk."
01:20:45.882,01:20:46.967,What are you doing?
01:20:51.096,01:20:52.473,I can cycle!
01:20:52.473,01:20:54.099,Oi! Come back!
01:20:54.099,01:20:56.352,What about the wrapping?!
01:20:57.728,01:21:00.481,ARTHUR: The church.
01:21:00.481,01:21:02.775,"Happy Christmas, cows!"

01:21:06.445,01:21:09.573,"German, leave out the carrot."
01:21:09.573,01:21:10.991,What the--?!
01:21:12.284,01:21:15.037,"Look, everyone!"
01:21:15.037,01:21:17.707,He's delivering the present.
01:21:17.707,01:21:20.167,It's Arthur.
01:21:20.167,01:21:21.711,COMPUTER: Meltdown paused.
01:21:24.797,01:21:27.383,BRYONY: Come back!
01:21:28.676,01:21:30.969,"Oh, my head."
01:21:30.969,01:21:33.347,"Ye baubles, a beautiful young reindeer."
01:21:33.347,01:21:35.974,"Ah. So who am I, then?"
01:21:37.518,01:21:40.354,"Okay, so I'm not great with children."
01:21:40.354,01:21:42.356,Does that make me a bad Santa?
01:21:43.774,01:21:45.025,You're hardly perfect.
01:21:45.025,01:21:46.819,Let me guess.
01:21:45.025,01:21:50.364,"You put in the address, you saw a list of Trelews and just clicked on the first one?"
01:21:50.364,01:21:52.991,You're just like Arthur.
01:21:52.991,01:21:55.411,Am I?
01:21:55.411,01:21:57.747,"Sir, the soldiers have shot the sleigh."
01:21:57.747,01:22:02.084,"DEBORAH: But, sir, it's Arthur."
01:22:02.084,01:22:04.754,Arthur! Arthur! Arthur!
01:22:05.921,01:22:07.256,Arthur?
01:22:08.382,01:22:09.842,Yah!
01:22:09.842,01:22:12.595,No one gets an unwrapped present on my watch.
01:22:15.598,01:22:17.433,Three bits of sticky tape.
01:22:17.433,01:22:19.435,Three.
01:22:19.435,01:22:21.019,Stand up!
