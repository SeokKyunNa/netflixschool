00:00:26.458,00:00:28.791,"You don't really write many these days, do you?"
00:00:29.291,00:00:31.458,But I bet there's one you never forget.
00:00:31.958,00:00:39.458,"Send it off to a certain plump guy in a red suit and, provided you've kept your act together more or less, he'll drop off a toy or two."
00:00:40.041,00:00:44.416,"And yet, no one seems to wonder how the whole thing got started in the first place."
00:00:45.625,00:00:48.958,"This is a story about letters, and it began..."
00:00:50.125,00:00:51.125,with this one.
00:01:37.083,00:01:38.708,"-80! -Drill Sergeant, sir!"
00:01:38.791,00:01:41.666,All the way from the top! Dispatch for one of your cadets!
00:01:43.416,00:01:45.208,"It's for him, sir."
00:01:54.041,00:01:55.416,Cadet Johanssen!
00:01:57.291,00:01:58.208,Stop.
00:01:58.291,00:02:00.416,Don't tell me. Let me try to guess.
00:02:01.250,00:02:02.416,I give up. Who are you?
00:02:02.500,00:02:03.375,Sarge!
00:02:03.458,00:02:05.958,Drill Sarge! Have a seat. Can I get you something to drink?
00:02:06.041,00:02:07.125,An espresso? A cappuccino?
00:02:07.208,00:02:10.458,Aren't you supposed to be in equestrian training?
00:02:10.541,00:02:11.416,Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
00:02:11.500,00:02:13.750,No worries. I've got someone covering for me.
00:02:21.833,00:02:22.666,What?
00:02:22.750,00:02:24.083,"Sarge, is that for real?"
00:02:26.083,00:02:27.125,"Here, hold these."
00:02:28.750,00:02:34.541,"Ah, well, I was expecting this a little bit sooner, but, yup, summoned to the dragon's lair."
00:02:34.625,00:02:37.875,"Go ahead and cancel the Drill Sergeant's espresso, actually."
00:02:37.958,00:02:39.500,"And, uh, here, why don't you finish mine?"
00:02:41.208,00:02:44.666,...and I'm gonna take one last look around the old place so I can forget it.
00:02:44.750,00:02:47.000,"Mmm-hmm. Got it. All right, let's go."
00:02:52.666,00:02:59.333,It's been nine months since I used every ounce of my influence to get you into the Royal Postal Academy.
00:02:59.416,00:03:02.708,"Actually, nine months and six days, but who's counting?"
00:03:02.791,00:03:04.333,What? No croutons?
00:03:04.416,00:03:06.166,"Oh, man, come on!"
00:03:06.250,00:03:08.500,Shall we take account of your progress then?
00:03:08.583,00:03:10.166,Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Definitely.
00:03:11.916,00:03:16.666,Sorting and filing: total failure.
00:03:16.750,00:03:18.625,Carrier pigeon care and handling...
00:03:20.166,00:03:22.083,...abysmal performance.
00:03:24.708,00:03:26.583,...worst on record.
00:03:27.166,00:03:28.125,"Well, there you have it."
00:03:28.208,00:03:30.833,"But, hey, we gave it the old college try, didn't we?"
00:03:31.375,00:03:34.041,Guess I'll just go pack up and head home then. Too bad.
00:03:34.125,00:03:35.333,"Darn, oh, darn."
00:03:35.416,00:03:37.333,"-Stay right where you are. -No, Dad!"
00:03:37.458,00:03:39.750,You're right. When will I grow up?
00:03:39.833,00:03:46.625,"When will I stop squandering all these opportunities, which you so kindly forced me into, and become my own man?"
00:03:46.708,00:03:50.500,I guess I must really hanker down and rethink my priorities.
00:03:50.583,00:03:53.791,All wrapped up in my silk sheets with some caviar and a sherry...
00:03:53.875,00:03:55.083,"You still buy the same brand, right?"
00:03:55.166,00:04:02.583,You think I'm just going to watch you purposely fail and then let you waltz right back to a privileged life void of any purpose or meaning?
00:04:02.666,00:04:09.291,"Well, yeah. Where else would I-- Congratulations. You are now a postman."
00:04:11.000,00:04:15.125,You are to establish a working postal office in...
00:04:25.333,00:04:27.083,Smeerensburg.
00:04:27.875,00:04:28.916,You've got one year.
00:04:29.000,00:04:31.166,What? A year? Where? Smeerensburg?
00:04:31.250,00:04:32.875,What is... What's happening right now? Dad?
00:04:32.958,00:04:34.791,Six thousand letters will suffice.
00:04:34.875,00:04:36.416,Stamped by your own hand.
00:04:36.500,00:04:38.125,"And listen carefully, Jesper."
00:04:38.208,00:04:41.416,"If you fail to get those letters, you're cut off."
00:04:41.958,00:04:47.000,"No more fancy apartments, All gone."
00:04:47.083,00:04:49.875,You can look forward to a cozy spot in the gutter.
00:04:49.958,00:04:52.583,"-But-- -Six thousand letters, one year."
00:04:52.666,00:04:55.625,"You can't cheat, bribe or squirm your way out of this one."
00:04:57.125,00:05:01.333,"Dad! Come on! It's me. Let's talk about this, man."
00:05:01.416,00:05:04.458,"It's your son, Jesper! Little Jespie!"
00:05:04.541,00:05:07.583,"Remember, I... Daddy, can I help you mail the letters?"
00:05:07.666,00:05:13.583,Can I help you put the medals in the letters and put them in a stamp with the-- W-w-wait!
00:05:13.666,00:05:15.916,Do you know how long it took to press this uniform?
00:05:16.500,00:05:18.958,"I don't either, but it took somebody hours."
00:05:19.041,00:05:20.041,Hello?
00:05:20.541,00:05:23.500,"Burghard! Finally, a friendly face. Can you believe what they..."
00:05:24.083,00:05:27.041,"Burghard, I'm not in the coach with you. Burghard?"
00:05:36.125,00:05:38.708,Isn't that a bit excessive?
00:05:40.125,00:05:43.416,"That boy needs a wake-up call, Sergeant. And who knows?"
00:05:43.958,00:05:47.125,Someday he might even thank me for it.
00:05:49.333,00:05:52.583,"This is really wonderful, Father. Thank you so much."
00:05:52.666,00:05:54.375,"This is great, Dad."
00:05:54.458,00:05:56.083,"Really, really great."
00:06:00.125,00:06:01.250,"Thanks, Dad!"
00:06:02.833,00:06:03.708,Thank you!
00:06:03.791,00:06:06.208,I love this terrible coach ride.
00:06:06.291,00:06:07.541,Thank you so much!
00:06:07.625,00:06:10.250,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank...
00:06:28.125,00:06:31.791,You go back to the intersection. You make a left at the dead tree.
00:06:31.875,00:06:32.875,You're welcome.
00:06:33.416,00:06:35.083,What? No. I'm not lost.
00:06:35.166,00:06:36.625,"Trust me, you are."
00:06:39.458,00:06:41.625,Any chance you might actually get on it today?
00:06:43.166,00:06:44.833,What was that?
00:06:44.916,00:06:47.333,New postman. Smeerensburg.
00:06:47.416,00:06:52.083,"Which is on an island, which is surrounded by water, which I need a boat to get to, which you have."
00:06:52.166,00:06:54.458,Are we starting to connect the dots?
00:07:04.041,00:07:05.916,Is the weather always like this?
00:07:06.000,00:07:08.291,Eh. We're having a bit of a heat wave.
00:07:12.125,00:07:13.125,Huh?
00:07:27.250,00:07:30.458,There she is. Smeerensburg.
00:07:34.000,00:07:37.000,"Charming, huh? Why, you should see it in the spring."
00:07:37.083,00:07:40.166,That's when those grays really pop.
00:07:48.666,00:07:50.416,What happened here?
00:07:50.500,00:07:54.958,"Oh! Uh, colorful local traditions. Quirky folklore. That kind of thing."
00:07:55.041,00:07:58.500,All part of this quaint town's vibrant culture.
00:08:01.291,00:08:03.291,"No, no! Why you..."
00:08:37.291,00:08:38.458,Where is everyone?
00:08:38.541,00:08:39.541,Everyone?
00:08:39.625,00:08:42.375,I thought there would be some sort of a reception.
00:08:43.833,00:08:47.750,"Oh! Right. Right, the reception. Of course, the reception."
00:08:47.833,00:08:48.833,It's good you reminded me.
00:08:48.916,00:08:53.041,"You just ring the bell over there and, uh... and then the reception will start."
00:08:53.125,00:08:55.458,-The bell? -Yep. Give it a go.
00:08:55.541,00:08:56.583,And they'll come out.
00:08:56.666,00:09:01.208,"Why, they'll have a band, hors d'oeuvres and, uh... and the key to the city."
00:09:01.291,00:09:03.083,All that reception stuff.
00:09:03.166,00:09:04.250,Really?
00:09:04.333,00:09:06.750,"-Out here? -Why, of course!"
00:09:06.833,00:09:11.458,"Well, it's not every day they get a brand-new postman from the big city."
00:09:19.750,00:09:20.916,Huh?
00:09:30.166,00:09:33.333,What's happening?
00:09:46.000,00:09:48.583,"Ow, they're biting! Ow, get off! Get off! Get off!"
00:09:54.833,00:09:56.416,And you thought they forgot.
00:10:15.208,00:10:17.333,-Uh... -What's going on out here?
00:10:19.708,00:10:22.500,Look who's finally throwing in the towel!
00:10:22.583,00:10:24.208,Throwing in the... Us?
00:10:24.291,00:10:25.541,Ha! That's rich!
00:10:25.625,00:10:29.291,Admit it! You weaseled out and rang the bell!
00:10:32.291,00:10:33.333,Don't you dare raise your voice at me!
00:10:33.416,00:10:34.833,"-Oh, there you go! -You rang that bell!"
00:10:42.333,00:10:44.458,"Huh. What've you got there, children?"
00:10:46.791,00:10:48.875,"Pumpkin, show Daddy what you found."
00:10:52.541,00:10:53.458,Mine.
00:10:56.000,00:10:58.000,This is no way to treat a person!
00:10:58.083,00:11:00.291,Certainly not this person!
00:11:00.375,00:11:01.750,Just one second. Let me just...
00:11:01.833,00:11:02.750,A postman?
00:11:02.833,00:11:05.083,-Pfft. Give me a break. -When will they learn?
00:11:05.166,00:11:07.958,Hey! They've sent us another postman!
00:11:11.666,00:11:13.291,All right. All right.
00:11:13.375,00:11:16.041,"You don't know who I am, so I'm gonna let this one slide."
00:11:16.125,00:11:19.000,Okay? But let's just say I'm not really a postman.
00:11:19.083,00:11:22.250,"Well, I am, because it's our family business. My father's a..."
00:11:22.333,00:11:25.041,"-Don't get me started, because it's-- -Where were we? Oh, yeah. Bell, please!"
00:11:43.166,00:11:44.125,"All right, listen."
00:11:44.208,00:11:48.791,"Whoever's there, I warn you, you do not want to mess with me. Okay?"
00:11:48.875,00:11:51.375,"Holy mackerel! Oh, the smell!"
00:11:51.458,00:11:54.125,Fresh out of mackerel. Only herring and burbot today.
00:12:00.750,00:12:01.666,Oh.
00:12:01.750,00:12:05.666,"Uniform, cold sweat, scared stiff, shaking in your boots."
00:12:05.750,00:12:08.416,"All right, I'm gonna just take a wild guess here."
00:12:08.500,00:12:14.416,"You are the latest mailman, and the ferryman tricked you into ringing the Battle Bell."
00:12:14.500,00:12:17.833,The Battle Bell? What kind of a town has a Battle Bell?
00:12:17.916,00:12:24.916,Can we open a window in here or something? I can't pretend any-- home of the world's finest feuds.
00:12:25.500,00:12:26.333,Feuds?
00:12:28.166,00:12:30.666,the Krums versus the Ellingboes.
00:12:32.375,00:12:35.500,"...are you gonna buy something, or are you just here to chitchat?"
00:12:36.041,00:12:36.875,Wait.
00:12:37.541,00:12:41.250,Isn't this a school? Shouldn't there be children and a teacher?
00:12:41.333,00:12:44.166,"Oh! Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you!"
00:12:44.250,00:12:46.500,I knew I was forgetting something! Children!
00:12:46.583,00:12:47.666,Thank you!
00:12:48.416,00:12:49.333,You're the teacher?
00:12:49.416,00:12:50.750,"Okay, here's how it works."
00:12:50.833,00:12:53.416,"I sell fish, and then the person on the other side of the counter..."
00:12:53.500,00:12:56.833,-That would be you. You buy-- -Holy moly! That's you?
00:12:57.500,00:12:58.958,What happened?
00:12:59.041,00:13:01.166,-What happened was-- -That's... That came out wrong.
00:13:01.250,00:13:05.375,I took a teaching job at a place where people don't send their kids to school!
00:13:09.291,00:13:17.375,"So, now I'm reduced to doing this so I can get some money and start fresh somewhere far, far away from here."
00:13:17.916,00:13:20.666,Are you going to buy something?
00:13:21.458,00:13:22.833,Herring's on sale today.
00:13:24.750,00:13:27.750,Ah! There you are. I wondered where you'd scurried off to!
00:13:27.833,00:13:29.250,"Morning, Miss. Alva."
00:13:31.666,00:13:33.791,I saved the best for last!
00:13:39.583,00:13:41.000,Home sweet home.
00:13:44.291,00:13:49.000,"-Mail that, postman! -Now wait a minute, that's completely-- Go home, you loser!"
00:13:49.083,00:13:52.916,"Oh, yeah? Well, if I'm a loser, then you're a, uh..."
00:13:53.000,00:13:54.791,You're too far. You're gone.
00:14:02.666,00:14:07.791,"Well, lots of nice, natural light, rustic touches, central air and panoramic views."
00:14:10.833,00:14:12.916,-Enjoy. -Wait! Wait!
00:14:13.000,00:14:14.708,This can't be right! I...
00:14:19.416,00:14:20.916,Ha ha. You got me.
00:14:21.000,00:14:24.083,"Okay, well, enough of that. Show me where I'm really staying."
00:14:24.166,00:14:26.375,I'd like a hot bath and a look at the dinner menu.
00:14:29.333,00:14:39.750,"You're a postman in Smeerensburg, which is on an island cut off from the world, frigid cold, angry, violent neighbors, and this is home now."
00:14:39.833,00:14:42.291,Are we starting to connect the dots?
00:14:45.125,00:14:45.958,Aah!
00:14:46.708,00:14:48.000,Ugh.
00:15:04.125,00:15:06.500,Almost. Hang in there.
00:15:19.625,00:15:20.625,What?
00:15:41.791,00:15:42.625,Hmm?
00:15:42.708,00:15:43.541,Oh.
00:15:51.125,00:15:51.958,I'm going home!
00:15:52.041,00:15:54.208,"No! You can't leave, remember?"
00:15:54.291,00:15:56.416,You'll be broke! Out in the streets!
00:15:56.500,00:15:58.416,But I hate it here!
00:15:58.500,00:16:00.125,It's so cold and icky!
00:16:00.208,00:16:02.875,And the people are mean to me. And I miss my silk sheets.
00:16:02.958,00:16:05.041,Shut up! Stop being weak!
00:16:05.125,00:16:07.208,Focus! How do you get out of here?
00:16:07.291,00:16:09.333,You need... You need...
00:16:09.916,00:16:11.041,letters!
00:16:11.125,00:16:12.125,Ugh.
00:16:14.166,00:16:16.416,All right. This is a good one. I can feel it.
00:16:16.500,00:16:18.875,"Come to Papa, you sweet, sweet little..."
00:16:18.958,00:16:20.625,"Oh, come on!"
00:16:20.708,00:16:22.125,Ugh! Pssh!
00:16:30.125,00:16:32.458,"Fine. Go to the source, I guess."
00:16:33.041,00:16:34.166,"Good morning, madame."
00:16:34.250,00:16:36.000,"I'm the postman, obviously."
00:16:36.083,00:16:40.041,"If you have letters you'd like me to send, you could go scurry ahead and get them and..."
00:16:46.250,00:16:47.416,Hello! Hi! Hi!
00:16:47.500,00:16:53.000,"If you have your letters on you, I'd be glad to take them off your-- Hmph!"
00:16:53.083,00:16:55.166,Birthday cards? Distant cousin?
00:16:55.250,00:16:56.208,Deceased notice?
00:16:56.291,00:16:57.541,Holy mother!
00:17:01.916,00:17:02.750,Any packages?
00:17:02.833,00:17:04.791,"Come on, people!"
00:17:04.875,00:17:07.791,Letters! Letters! I don't have all day!
00:17:10.666,00:17:12.916,"Okay, keep low. Don't panic. Don't panic."
00:17:13.000,00:17:15.833,"Oh, I guess that's why they call it snail mail."
00:17:16.833,00:17:19.500,All right. What's going on here? Where are all the letters?
00:17:19.583,00:17:23.166,Oh. Folks around here only have one thing to say to one another.
00:17:24.333,00:17:25.166,Ah.
00:17:25.250,00:17:28.041,And they're getting their point across pretty well without mail.
00:17:28.125,00:17:29.750,"-Wouldn't you say? -Wait, wait, wait."
00:17:29.833,00:17:33.416,No letters? But how am I supposed to get out of...
00:17:36.250,00:17:38.750,"Sir, can I get my drawing back?"
00:17:38.833,00:17:40.291,The wind blew it away.
00:17:40.875,00:17:42.500,"-Please? -Not now, kid."
00:17:42.583,00:17:45.583,Can't you see I'm busy trying to figure out how to get...
00:17:46.750,00:17:47.916,"Well, here's a thought."
00:17:48.000,00:17:49.291,"I'm a postman, see?"
00:17:49.375,00:17:53.458,"So I can't give it to you, but I could mail it to you."
00:17:55.291,00:18:04.458,"I just fold your pretty drawing, very beautiful by the way, put it in an envelope like this and then all that's left is postage so I can put it in the mailbox for you."
00:18:05.000,00:18:06.333,-Postage? -Yep.
00:18:06.416,00:18:10.875,"You just toss a penny over to me so I can stamp it, and we're all ready to go."
00:18:11.958,00:18:14.458,Couldn't you just put it in?
00:18:14.541,00:18:16.291,Aw. Tsk.
00:18:16.375,00:18:19.625,"I really, really would, but I can't."
00:18:19.708,00:18:22.458,It's not a letter if it doesn't have postage.
00:18:22.541,00:18:23.416,See how it works?
00:18:24.000,00:18:24.958,So what do you say?
00:18:25.041,00:18:27.208,"I get my letter, and you get your drawing."
00:18:27.291,00:18:29.458,"Win-win. You want your drawing, don't you?"
00:18:29.541,00:18:31.083,"-Um... -If you don't, I'm gonna keep it."
00:18:31.166,00:18:32.458,-Hmm. -I love it.
00:18:32.541,00:18:36.000,"I would keep it if I was you, so I would send this letter back to myself if I was you."
00:18:39.666,00:18:42.583,This nice man says he can mail my drawing back to me!
00:18:45.166,00:18:47.291,"Oh, look at that. Wrong address. Silly me."
00:18:47.375,00:18:49.166,These aren't... You're not the Spendlebergs.
00:18:49.250,00:18:50.250,I'll see you later.
00:18:54.625,00:18:57.666,Ah. And that must be the express mail.
00:19:00.333,00:19:04.083,"You may have won this round, but if you think I'm giving up, think again."
00:19:04.166,00:19:09.708,"I'll have my letters in no time, and then it's bye-bye to you and your cold and your loons and your chickens! That's right! You too!"
00:19:10.750,00:19:12.416,You'll see. I give it a week.
00:19:13.000,00:19:14.083,"Two, tops."
00:19:37.125,00:19:40.083,Is this a bad time? I can see you're pretty swamped.
00:19:45.041,00:19:46.958,a job or something?
00:19:47.041,00:19:48.291,"Why, sure I do."
00:19:48.375,00:19:51.583,I'm here to pick up all the outgoing mail.
00:19:51.666,00:19:52.833,"So, where is it?"
00:19:52.916,00:19:55.041,"Now, you're gonna have to help me with the heavier bags."
00:19:55.125,00:19:56.166,"Bad back, don't you know."
00:19:58.833,00:20:01.416,"So, uh, where is the mail, anyway?"
00:20:01.500,00:20:04.166,Where do you keep it? In a different room now or something?
00:20:04.250,00:20:10.333,"What about if I walk around the room, if I get close to the mail, you say warmer?"
00:20:10.416,00:20:15.125,"And if I'm getting farther from the mail, you say colder?"
00:20:15.708,00:20:16.875,-And then-- -What's that?
00:20:17.458,00:20:19.208,"What? Oh, the woodsman's cabin?"
00:20:21.250,00:20:24.125,"Well, sure. Yeah, you should definitely drop by."
00:20:24.208,00:20:27.250,Nice fella. Loves visitors.
00:21:52.541,00:21:56.708,Hello? I'm in your house or... whatever this place is.
00:21:56.791,00:21:57.875,Anybody here?
00:22:04.875,00:22:06.750,"Ah, come on. Really?"
00:22:11.250,00:22:13.916,Of course. Of course this would happen.
00:22:19.041,00:22:21.750,Great. I'm gonna kill that boatman.
00:22:27.000,00:22:27.916,What?
00:22:32.666,00:22:33.666,Toys?
00:22:38.208,00:22:39.083,"Ah, here we go."
00:22:45.833,00:22:50.875,Now I can go home with the satisfaction of having accomplished absolutely...
00:23:18.083,00:23:19.416,Aah!
00:23:29.875,00:23:31.208,Aah!
00:24:03.083,00:24:04.083,Yeehaw!
00:25:16.458,00:25:18.125,That's it! I've had it!
00:25:18.208,00:25:20.583,Better alive in the gutter than hacked into pieces!
00:25:20.666,00:25:21.916,"No, thank you!"
00:25:25.000,00:25:25.833,Yah!
00:25:47.958,00:25:49.083,Where's this?
00:25:49.166,00:25:51.375,What? I don't know. How would I...
00:25:51.458,00:25:52.291,Wait.
00:25:53.125,00:25:54.125,I do know.
00:25:54.208,00:25:56.833,"Keep going down this road, and you'll get there."
00:25:56.916,00:25:59.000,You can't miss it. It... Or I can show you.
00:25:59.083,00:26:01.166,"Sure. Yeah, let me just show you."
00:26:11.041,00:26:12.125,All right.
00:26:13.208,00:26:14.583,Excuse me. Just... Can I...
00:26:16.333,00:26:17.250,Here we are.
00:26:17.333,00:26:19.958,"Watch your step getting out of the, uh... What's this?"
00:26:20.875,00:26:22.708,"You're a postman, aren't you?"
00:26:26.041,00:26:27.291,"No, but I..."
00:26:31.916,00:26:38.166,Nothing I'd love to do more than deliver what I'm fairly certain can only be a severed head of some kind.
00:26:38.250,00:26:40.083,"I mean, there's no way that's not a severed head."
00:26:40.166,00:26:42.875,"It's gotta... I'm holding a head in my hand, but hey!"
00:26:43.875,00:26:47.791,"Come on! Look, I'm-- Ah! You're right there!"
00:26:47.875,00:26:50.666,So quiet for a disproportionately...
00:26:53.666,00:26:55.541,"You have a kind of, um..."
00:26:59.500,00:27:00.708,What? In there?
00:27:00.791,00:27:03.083,You must be kidding. No way. Absolutely not.
00:27:03.166,00:27:07.083,"I mean, first of all, I'd love to, of course, but, look, too bad about the fence."
00:27:07.166,00:27:08.625,"Rats. Oh, well."
00:27:08.708,00:27:10.958,What are you gonna do? Are you... What's happening right now?
00:27:12.500,00:27:14.083,"Hey, listen, please. Open this!"
00:27:16.500,00:27:17.458,"Oh, no."
00:27:22.541,00:27:25.083,"Okay, you win. What do you want? Money? My dad's got plenty of it."
00:27:25.166,00:27:27.083,"You can write him a ransom note. You can write, right?"
00:27:27.166,00:27:28.375,"Oh, it doesn't matter. I'll write it for you."
00:27:29.333,00:27:32.666,Ah! He'll never know it's me! I'll make it sound like it's from you!
00:27:32.750,00:27:35.166,"I'll use monosyllabic words, man! Please! Please! Please!"
00:27:35.250,00:27:40.875,Just let me out of here! I'm gonna get-- Why?
00:27:53.583,00:27:54.416,Aah!
00:27:54.500,00:27:56.166,"Door, door, door."
00:28:02.291,00:28:04.375,This has gotta move! Come on! Come on!
00:28:06.458,00:28:08.208,Open up. Open up. Open up! Come on!
00:28:08.291,00:28:09.541,Come on! Come on! Come on!
00:28:10.333,00:28:13.750,Come on! Come on! Come on! Keep it together! Keep it together!
00:28:16.000,00:28:16.833,Aah!
00:28:24.583,00:28:25.791,"Where are they, boys?"
00:28:25.875,00:28:28.625,Don't let 'em get away! Come on! Get 'em!
00:28:29.916,00:28:44.375,I've done all you've asked. Can I please-- Hmm.
00:30:14.916,00:30:15.750,Has he?
00:30:20.750,00:30:22.041,Are you in there?
00:30:23.208,00:30:25.000,Go away! Go! Leave! He'll hear you!
00:30:25.875,00:30:28.208,We'd like to send these letters!
00:30:34.541,00:30:36.291,What? What did you just say?
00:30:36.375,00:30:41.000,"Our cousin told us if we write a letter to Mr. Klaus, he'll make us a toy."
00:30:41.083,00:30:43.375,He also said to bring you a penny each.
00:30:43.458,00:30:46.750,"It's not a letter if it doesn't have postage, right?"
00:30:57.750,00:30:59.583,"-Psst. Hey. Hey, you. -Hmm?"
00:30:59.666,00:31:00.666,You want a toy?
00:31:07.041,00:31:08.000,like a brand-new toy?
00:31:08.666,00:31:11.250,Just write a letter to Mr. Klaus.
00:31:12.500,00:31:17.166,"And you put it in the envelope, write your name on it and bring a penny."
00:31:17.250,00:31:18.333,Can't forget the penny.
00:31:35.541,00:31:37.666,These better sound sad. Do they sound sad?
00:31:38.250,00:31:39.166,"Okay, good job."
00:31:45.458,00:31:47.958,All right. And now...
00:31:48.625,00:31:49.708,for the tricky part.
00:32:23.750,00:32:24.875,All right. Remember...
00:32:25.458,00:32:27.583,"probably not an ax murderer, though..."
00:32:28.166,00:32:30.916,"it still is a possibility, but most likely... no."
00:32:31.541,00:32:33.458,He's a good guy... deep down.
00:32:40.208,00:32:43.458,You remember me from the nice breaking and entering last night?
00:32:50.625,00:32:51.750,"I, uh..."
00:32:51.833,00:33:00.166,"You see, Mr. Klaus, it seems like word got around that the poor children of Smeerensburg have started, uh..."
00:33:00.250,00:33:01.791,completely unprompted...
00:33:01.875,00:33:04.375,writing letters asking you for...
00:33:08.041,00:33:14.583,"So I figured you have the whole barn filled with toys just sitting there collecting dust, so..."
00:33:18.291,00:33:21.125,"Oh, God. Okay. This is it. Here it goes."
00:33:35.541,00:33:37.208,That is...
00:33:38.625,00:33:39.958,totally normal.
00:33:40.041,00:33:42.458,Not a symptom of any mental illness or anything.
00:33:47.000,00:33:49.541,...if you donate your old toys to them...
00:33:59.375,00:34:00.500,"Mr. Klaus, wait!"
00:34:03.458,00:34:06.791,Think of all the joy you'll bring their miserable little lives!
00:34:07.708,00:34:08.541,"Look, here."
00:34:09.083,00:34:10.208,Poor little Herlief.
00:34:10.291,00:34:13.208,He only has sticks and stones to play with. So sad.
00:34:13.291,00:34:17.000,"And this one, little Penny... Patty."
00:34:17.083,00:34:21.708,"Her doll was so old, it crumbled in her arms when she came to me."
00:34:21.791,00:34:24.541,"And then Kristoff... Little, ugly Kristoff."
00:34:25.333,00:34:26.208,This little...
00:34:33.208,00:34:34.625,"Tonight, same time."
00:34:35.916,00:34:39.791,"Great! What, same time? You mean, dead of night?"
00:34:39.875,00:34:42.166,-I can just take the toys now. -No. I go with you.
00:34:42.250,00:34:44.458,"There's no need for you to come with me, really."
00:34:44.541,00:34:48.875,It might be against the law for a noncertified postman to ride with me.
00:34:48.958,00:34:50.291,I have to check the rule book.
00:34:50.875,00:34:54.291,"Great. Tonight, then. I'll see you then. Good talk. Good talk."
00:35:25.333,00:35:27.291,Whoa! Whoo!
00:35:28.791,00:35:29.625,Huh?
00:35:40.750,00:35:42.583,"Playing, I tell you."
00:35:42.666,00:35:44.000,With an Ellingboe!
00:35:46.500,00:35:48.500,-Did you all hear that? -Unacceptable.
00:35:50.083,00:35:52.333,I turned away for one second...
00:35:54.500,00:35:56.000,And then I saw it.
00:35:56.083,00:35:58.125,"I brought her as soon as I could, sir."
00:35:58.208,00:36:00.458,"-That's just wrong! Wrong, I say! -Inconceivable!"
00:36:00.541,00:36:02.625,-What are we going to do? -Unthinkable!
00:36:02.708,00:36:05.333,Hmm. This is bad. Very bad.
00:36:05.416,00:36:08.541,"Worst I've ever seen, really. What were you thinking, kid?"
00:36:08.625,00:36:12.875,Don't you know that-- Krums and Ellingboes don't mix.
00:36:13.541,00:36:15.375,-But why? -Why? he asks!
00:36:17.000,00:36:18.166,I don't know what to do!
00:36:18.750,00:36:21.125,"Please help us, miss! I beg you!"
00:36:29.500,00:36:32.416,"Do you know what this is, little boy?"
00:36:33.125,00:36:36.833,This is tradition!
00:36:36.916,00:36:42.916,"Centuries of glorious hatred, passed down through generations!"
00:36:43.000,00:36:45.833,There was the hundred-day brawl of '45.
00:36:45.916,00:36:47.500,Which we totally won!
00:36:47.583,00:36:49.500,The maritime game of chicken.
00:36:49.583,00:36:52.291,The Great Mooning of '86.
00:36:54.458,00:36:56.583,"So, if there's something we know..."
00:36:56.666,00:36:59.250,...going back as far as we can remember...
00:36:59.333,00:37:01.833,...it's that a Krum despises an Ellingboe...
00:37:01.916,00:37:05.458,...and an Ellingboe can't stand a Krum!
00:37:09.958,00:37:11.875,That is why.
00:37:12.958,00:37:19.958,"Now, I just know you didn't mean to disrespect all of that heritage, right?"
00:37:20.041,00:37:24.541,"-Right. -And it won't happen again, will it?"
00:37:25.541,00:37:27.125,Of course not.
00:37:27.666,00:37:30.916,"Now, tell me all about where this pretty thing came from."
00:37:35.625,00:37:36.625,Ugh.
00:37:37.458,00:37:40.583,Let me guess. Leaving it at the gate not an option?
00:37:43.083,00:37:45.333,"You really have a way with words, you know?"
00:37:46.291,00:37:49.083,"Of course, you don't... Of course, don't even answer that..."
00:37:52.958,00:37:54.541,I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
00:37:57.083,00:37:58.375,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no!"
00:38:01.083,00:38:02.875,"Stop, stop, stop!"
00:38:02.958,00:38:04.541,Stop! Stop!
00:38:05.750,00:38:06.750,Aah!
00:38:38.791,00:38:39.958,Whoa! Whoa!
00:38:50.375,00:38:51.416,I want a bicycle!
00:38:51.500,00:38:53.083,-Tell Mr. Klaus I want a bicycle! -Shut up!
00:38:53.166,00:38:54.875,-Take my letter! Take my letter! -Mine! Me!
00:38:54.958,00:38:56.875,Me first! Me first! A doll!
00:38:56.958,00:39:00.458,-Me! Me! Me! -Okay! Okay! Single line! Chop-chop!
00:39:00.541,00:39:02.791,"Fall back! All right. Everyone, in line."
00:39:02.875,00:39:04.000,-There you go. -Get out! Move.
00:39:04.083,00:39:07.000,Letter? Good. Letter? Good.
00:39:07.083,00:39:09.208,Got it. Get out of here. Great. Move along.
00:39:14.208,00:39:18.375,-What's wrong with her mouth? -She's not from here. She's Saami.
00:39:22.166,00:39:26.291,"Right, that's nice. But I see no letter, so please come back when you have one."
00:39:26.375,00:39:27.375,Have a nice day.
00:39:27.458,00:39:29.416,"Bye-bye. Okay, any other letters?"
00:39:30.666,00:39:32.416,"Good. The rest, you know the deal."
00:39:32.500,00:39:33.791,"No letter, no toy."
00:39:33.875,00:39:35.833,But we don't know how to write.
00:39:37.625,00:39:39.208,"Tough luck, kid."
00:39:39.291,00:39:41.333,"Wait, you know what you could do?"
00:39:55.625,00:39:57.166,-What are you doing? -Aah!
00:39:57.250,00:39:59.625,Telling children to go to school to learn to write?
00:39:59.708,00:40:00.583,What is wrong with you?
00:40:00.666,00:40:06.083,"Yeah, yes. What I meant to do-- Whatever you're doing, leave me out of it."
00:40:06.166,00:40:10.333,"I have been rotting away here for five years, and I am so close to getting out."
00:40:10.416,00:40:12.083,I am not about to let you mess it all up.
00:40:12.666,00:40:13.541,You got it?
00:40:13.625,00:40:17.041,These children wasting away without a proper education?
00:40:17.125,00:40:18.125,I mean...
00:40:19.541,00:40:22.875,"Forgive me, I'm kind of a dreamer, but... isn't that why we do it?"
00:40:22.958,00:40:24.041,Hmm? Hmm?
00:40:24.125,00:40:25.958,Why you became a teacher?
00:40:26.041,00:40:27.666,So you could make a difference?
00:40:32.208,00:40:34.458,Ah. Young love.
00:40:34.541,00:40:35.666,"Takes me back, you know?"
00:40:35.750,00:40:39.250,"The intense looks, the palpitation of the heart."
00:40:39.333,00:40:41.750,"The whimpering and the soiling of the pants, no."
00:40:41.833,00:40:43.291,I can't relate to so much.
00:40:48.500,00:40:52.708,"So you go to sleep, and when you wake up in the morning, the present is right there by the fireplace!"
00:40:52.791,00:40:54.958,"Yeah, Mr. Klaus is amazing!"
00:40:57.166,00:40:59.166,Klaus? Awesome?
00:40:59.250,00:41:02.125,"He's huge, but he can squeeze down any chimney!"
00:41:02.208,00:41:03.875,-Really? How? -I don't know.
00:41:03.958,00:41:04.958,"Magic, I guess."
00:41:08.666,00:41:09.666,There.
00:41:09.750,00:41:11.000,Ugh.
00:41:11.083,00:41:15.375,"If you leave your socks hanging on the mantle, Mr. Klaus will fill them with toys!"
00:41:20.000,00:41:21.750,No one has ever seen him.
00:41:49.875,00:41:51.875,"Go home, you loser!"
00:41:53.208,00:41:54.041,Hmm.
00:41:58.500,00:42:00.666,"Who's the loser now, you little brat?"
00:42:00.750,00:42:02.708,Mr. Klaus is the coolest.
00:42:04.625,00:42:06.208,"His name is Klaus, and he makes the best toys."
00:42:06.958,00:42:08.416,-Klaus. -Klaus.
00:42:08.500,00:42:09.625,-Klaus. -He's awesome.
00:42:09.708,00:42:10.833,His toys are the best.
00:42:24.208,00:42:25.583,-What happened? -Not a word.
00:42:26.125,00:42:28.541,"You just sit there, be all magical and awesome."
00:42:31.125,00:42:31.958,What?
00:42:37.416,00:42:40.083,Are we going to learn something today?
00:42:42.625,00:42:45.833,"Look, if you have to be here, at least be quiet."
00:42:45.916,00:42:50.083,"Why don't you go ahead and just, I don't know, write vowels or something?"
00:42:50.166,00:42:51.625,We don't have notebooks.
00:42:51.708,00:42:52.708,Or pens.
00:42:54.000,00:42:55.333,"All right. Okay, let's make a deal."
00:42:55.416,00:42:58.916,"if I teach you something, will you get out of here? Please?"
00:43:13.416,00:43:14.875,There you go.
00:43:16.250,00:43:18.125,Really? That's my name?
00:43:18.708,00:43:20.416,"Yes. Yay, it's your name."
00:43:20.500,00:43:21.875,Wow.
00:43:22.416,00:43:23.541,Can you teach me more?
00:43:25.666,00:43:28.000,-I want to write my name. -Me too. I want to write my name.
00:43:28.083,00:43:30.500,-Pick me! -I want to write my name!
00:43:30.583,00:43:32.583,-Me too! I want to write my name! -Teach me!
00:43:32.666,00:43:34.625,-I want to write my name! -Me next!
00:43:53.416,00:43:54.333,Too heavy.
00:43:54.875,00:43:55.750,"Okay, then."
00:43:55.833,00:43:58.166,I can go by myself. You don't have to...
00:43:58.250,00:44:02.625,"I mean, no offense, but someone could use a little diet cleanse. What are you doing?"
00:44:03.916,00:44:06.208,"Less presents, less weight."
00:44:06.291,00:44:07.250,Less presents?
00:44:07.333,00:44:11.291,"But less presents means less letters, and less letters means less..."
00:44:14.125,00:44:16.625,more children's dreams being shattered.
00:44:17.125,00:44:20.125,"No. No, no, no, I won't allow it."
00:44:20.208,00:44:22.916,We have a sworn duty for the children.
00:44:40.000,00:44:40.916,Gotcha!
00:44:47.375,00:44:48.208,Aah!
00:45:02.041,00:45:03.833,Aah! Ow! Ow!
00:45:25.958,00:45:29.250,"Right. I wear them down, and you catch them."
00:45:29.333,00:45:31.375,Good teamwork... Whoa! Whoa!
00:45:39.833,00:45:41.166,-Whoo hoo hoo! -Whoa ho ho!
00:45:43.541,00:45:44.625,"-That's right. -Good call, reindeer."
00:45:44.708,00:45:45.541,This is good teamwork here.
00:45:45.625,00:45:47.666,"-We're making good time. -Reliable, strong, cooperative."
00:45:52.583,00:45:55.083,"Okay, post office is now officially open."
00:45:55.166,00:45:56.708,"You have your letters, step right in."
00:45:56.791,00:45:58.666,Thank you. Thank you.
00:46:00.541,00:46:01.625,What gives?
00:46:01.708,00:46:05.458,"I sent my letter, and all I got was a lousy clump of coal!"
00:46:05.541,00:46:06.708,"Well, it serves you right!"
00:46:06.791,00:46:09.541,Devilish little tadpoles like yourself don't get toys from Klaus.
00:46:09.625,00:46:13.250,"Oh, yeah? And how would he know what I'm up to unless you ratted on me?"
00:46:14.916,00:46:16.291,"Oh, I didn't have to."
00:46:17.416,00:46:18.708,He knows.
00:46:21.208,00:46:22.333,What do you mean?
00:46:22.416,00:46:24.875,"He sees everything, you know."
00:46:25.416,00:46:28.125,"Every mischief, prank and dirty deed."
00:46:28.708,00:46:30.708,He keeps a list. The...
00:46:32.208,00:46:35.916,"-Naughty List, he calls it. -You lie!"
00:46:36.000,00:46:36.958,Trust me.
00:46:37.541,00:46:39.875,You do not want to be on the Naughty List.
00:46:49.166,00:46:51.083,I didn't think so.
00:47:10.208,00:47:12.000,Only good children get toys?
00:47:17.541,00:47:20.208,I shoveled all the yards on my street today.
00:47:21.583,00:47:23.541,"-That's good, right? -Hi!"
00:47:23.625,00:47:26.250,Please don't put me on the Naughty List.
00:47:28.041,00:47:31.166,"today, me and my brothers helped Mom with the chores."
00:47:33.416,00:47:36.833,We'll do this every day if you bring us some toys. Honest!
00:47:41.833,00:47:43.125,and then he fell...
00:47:45.625,00:47:47.333,-It must've really hurt... -Let go of me!
00:47:47.416,00:47:50.666,-...'cause he would not stop screaming. -I'm being attacked by Ellingboes! Help!
00:47:50.750,00:47:52.000,So we helped him.
00:47:52.083,00:47:55.833,"He said he didn't like it, but... deep down, I think he did."
00:47:57.625,00:48:02.375,"And yesterday, instead of stealing Mrs. Runa's berries, we picked them all up for her."
00:48:03.750,00:48:07.666,"She came to our house later, and she brought Mom lots of berry jam."
00:48:07.750,00:48:09.000,Hmph.
00:48:13.291,00:48:18.000,"...I've been going to class every day, -and I always do my homework. -Oh, Annelisse! Thank you!"
00:48:20.458,00:48:22.041,"Hi, Mr. Postman!"
00:48:28.166,00:48:31.958,I hope I did a good job. He seemed happy.
00:48:32.583,00:48:34.625,Could I get a toy please?
00:48:42.041,00:48:42.875,Huh?
00:48:45.083,00:48:45.916,Huh?
00:48:55.583,00:48:56.583,What?
00:48:59.291,00:49:00.333,What the...
00:49:16.166,00:49:31.541,"Hey, there, Chief. How're we doin'-- Whoo! Come on, guys! Let's play!"
00:50:07.083,00:50:11.833,I think it's time we send that postman... a message.
00:50:13.250,00:50:15.666,"You know what to do, pumpkin."
00:50:23.916,00:50:25.875,without razor blades in the dough or anything.
00:50:25.958,00:50:30.291,"Oh, and did you know that arson is down 70%?"
00:50:30.375,00:50:32.916,It's true. When's the last time you saw a house burn down?
00:50:33.000,00:50:36.000,"Precisely. And cookouts, swap meets, and, uh..."
00:50:36.083,00:50:36.958,"yeah, I don't know."
00:50:37.041,00:50:39.000,It's like everyone's gone mad or something.
00:50:40.500,00:50:42.791,A true selfless act...
00:50:43.291,00:50:44.791,always sparks another.
00:50:45.875,00:50:51.875,"Well, look who's suddenly a chatterbox. Tell me, what made you squander all those words into that nugget of wisdom?"
00:50:51.958,00:50:54.250,"Oh, just something..."
00:50:54.833,00:50:56.083,someone used to say.
00:50:56.166,00:50:57.625,"Well, let me tell you something."
00:50:57.708,00:51:01.375,I've been around long enough to know that everyone is out to get something.
00:51:01.458,00:51:04.666,Those kids? Those kids are in it for the toys. And the grown-ups?
00:51:04.750,00:51:06.833,"Well, I don’t know what they’re after."
00:51:06.916,00:51:09.333,but it sure is not goodwill and peace on Earth.
00:51:10.750,00:51:11.750,What about you?
00:51:12.541,00:51:14.250,-What's in it for you? -Me?
00:51:21.000,00:51:22.000,Look out!
00:51:29.750,00:51:31.458,What are you doing at our ambush?
00:51:31.541,00:51:33.666,Your ambush? This is our ambush!
00:51:33.750,00:51:35.500,"-Stop, stop, stop! -I'm trying!"
00:51:43.250,00:51:45.000,"Oh, great! Look what you've done!"
00:51:46.666,00:51:47.875,Whoa!
00:52:08.833,00:52:10.083,Wow.
00:52:18.291,00:52:19.791,"Friends of yours, I take it?"
00:52:20.875,00:52:21.791,Uh...
00:52:22.541,00:52:23.750,They seem nice.
00:52:31.833,00:52:36.000,You guys are not gonna believe what I saw last night!
00:52:36.958,00:52:41.666,A flying sleigh pulled by magical reindeer?
00:52:41.750,00:52:43.000,Yep.
00:52:48.083,00:52:49.750,"Oh, look, it can laugh."
00:52:49.833,00:52:51.166,-Ho ho ho! -Mystery solved.
00:52:51.250,00:52:53.500,Ho ho ho!
00:52:53.583,00:52:55.666,Ho ho ho!
00:52:56.416,00:52:58.833,"Wait, wait, wait. Time out. Really?"
00:52:58.916,00:53:00.250,-That's how you laugh? -Right.
00:53:00.333,00:53:01.541,Let's load up.
00:53:01.625,00:53:03.958,"Oh, no, no. You don't get off that easy."
00:53:04.041,00:53:05.250,-Let me hear it again. -No.
00:53:05.333,00:53:08.625,Come on. Just a snicker or a chuckle.
00:53:08.708,00:53:10.375,-Just a giggle. -Keep it up. See what happens.
00:53:10.458,00:53:11.416,All right. I'll stop.
00:53:11.500,00:53:15.541,"Say, have you heard the one about the one-legged man who walks into a bar?"
00:53:32.416,00:53:34.916,"Say, we're kinda running low on inventory, aren't we?"
00:53:35.000,00:53:38.083,"Yes, only a couple more trips, and that should do it."
00:53:38.833,00:53:39.750,You must be...
00:53:40.250,00:53:43.375,looking forward to no more night shifts.
00:53:43.458,00:53:44.958,-Right? -Right.
00:53:45.041,00:53:47.125,Yeah. Yeah.
00:53:48.041,00:53:49.041,Me too.
00:54:03.416,00:54:05.083,"Hello, Postman!"
00:54:05.166,00:54:06.875,"Oh, good, you're back."
00:54:09.083,00:54:13.750,"Yes, yes, yes. That's very nice, but whatever it is you're saying, I've got my own problems, you know?"
00:54:15.041,00:54:19.375,"I mean, we are out of toys, and without toys, there are no letters."
00:54:19.458,00:54:20.583,And without letters...
00:54:21.166,00:54:22.416,Ugh! Forget it.
00:54:24.833,00:54:26.791,"I'm running out of time! There, I said it!"
00:54:26.875,00:54:29.416,"It's almost Christmas already, and I still..."
00:54:30.416,00:54:32.791,Christmas. Christmas.
00:54:32.875,00:54:34.000,That’s it. Wait.
00:54:38.750,00:54:41.041,Can you please get off my porch? You're trespassing.
00:54:56.833,00:55:02.666,"I, leader of the proud Krum-- Get on with it already."
00:55:02.750,00:55:05.583,"Shut up, you idiot! I'm getting to it!"
00:55:06.791,00:55:09.750,"I, leader of the proud..."
00:55:09.833,00:55:11.833,"Oh, forget it. The mood is gone."
00:55:11.916,00:55:14.000,You know why I'm calling this meeting.
00:55:14.083,00:55:15.833,"Yeah, I... Of course I know."
00:55:15.916,00:55:16.791,Uh...
00:55:16.875,00:55:19.333,"-Midnight brawl? -Look around, Aksel!"
00:55:19.416,00:55:20.583,Where is your clan?
00:55:23.833,00:55:25.958,-Huh. -I'll tell you where they are.
00:55:26.041,00:55:30.166,They're at block parties! Hayrides! And cookouts!
00:55:30.250,00:55:32.416,Brunches! Don't forget about the brunches.
00:55:36.833,00:55:42.583,You see? The postman and that old toy maker are brainwashing everyone!
00:55:42.666,00:55:43.750,What're you saying?
00:55:43.833,00:55:47.708,I'm saying it's time to join forces against a common enemy.
00:55:50.291,00:55:53.250,I'm saying we need a truce.
00:55:56.500,00:56:06.375,"Either we band together to take care of this, or it's gonna be all book clubs -Don't forget about the brunches. -Yes, that... that too."
00:56:06.458,00:56:11.791,"So, we must join together in peace to help stop this peace?"
00:56:11.875,00:56:15.166,Our ancestors demand it.
00:56:18.125,00:56:20.166,For the Ellingboe bloodline!
00:56:20.250,00:56:22.791,For the Krums' honor.
00:56:23.541,00:56:26.416,The clans are on the warpath...
00:56:27.708,00:56:28.791,together!
00:56:32.083,00:56:33.833,Mine! Mine!
00:56:33.916,00:56:35.333,Mine!
00:56:41.833,00:56:45.333,This is gonna take a lot of work.
00:57:47.541,00:57:49.791,-Surprise! -Oh!
00:57:49.875,00:57:50.875,Jesper?
00:57:50.958,00:57:54.750,-Wha-what are you-- -Welcome to your new workshop!
00:57:54.833,00:58:00.500,"-Ta-da! -What... What is-- -It'll all be explained in a minute. -Why did you-- -I don't want to-- -Come. Sit, sit, sit."
00:58:01.125,00:58:03.166,You'll love this. I promise.
00:58:04.333,00:58:05.875,Christmas!
00:58:06.875,00:58:14.083,Christmas? What do you-- Think about it! Every child in town gets up on Christmas morning and finds a...
00:58:14.166,00:58:17.250,brand-new toy waiting for them by the fireplace.
00:58:17.750,00:58:19.875,We can make the holiday even more magical.
00:58:19.958,00:58:21.708,Think of the joy. Think of the happiness.
00:58:21.791,00:58:24.208,"Jesper, listen. I don't think-- Puh-puh-puh!"
00:58:24.291,00:58:26.458,Let me finish. Let me finish.
00:58:27.333,00:58:29.083,"Think of all those happy little faces, huh?"
00:58:29.166,00:58:30.750,They're so cute! They're just... Aww!
00:58:32.625,00:58:34.875,Where are you gonna get that many toys?
00:58:35.375,00:58:36.208,You...
00:58:36.875,00:58:37.958,make new ones!
00:58:41.041,00:58:42.833,I don't make toys.
00:58:44.666,00:58:45.791,Not anymore.
00:58:45.875,00:58:49.125,"Pfft. You... You have a gift, my friend."
00:58:49.208,00:58:51.250,"Birdhouses are nice and all, but come on!"
00:58:51.333,00:58:54.041,Those hands were meant -for making-- -I said no.
00:58:54.125,00:58:56.916,Come on! Work with me here. Picture the possibilities.
00:58:57.000,00:58:58.583,"Look, woodwork would go here."
00:58:58.666,00:59:03.250,"-No. -And here, clockwork with all the gears and the cogs, -for you to tinker with all day. -Stop it."
00:59:03.333,00:59:08.500,"And in this corner, row after row of shiny tools -of all shapes and sizes. -Wait! Don't touch that!"
00:59:08.583,00:59:10.500,-Impeccably organized for you! -No!
00:59:22.833,00:59:23.750,What's this?
00:59:26.041,00:59:26.916,Get out.
00:59:27.416,00:59:28.875,"Klaus, I'm sorry."
00:59:28.958,00:59:30.541,"-I, I didn’t mean-- -Get out!"
01:00:07.541,01:00:09.875,"Ugh. Well, join the club."
01:00:12.500,01:00:14.583,"Nah, I don't want to bore you with it."
01:00:17.666,01:00:19.666,"Well, okay. It's just been bothering me, you know?"
01:00:19.750,01:00:23.625,"If I don't get those letters, then what am I supposed to do?"
01:00:23.708,01:00:29.541,"Stay in this little town forever, hanging out with an old woodsman, surrounded by crazy people, and never wanting anything more?"
01:00:32.333,01:00:35.416,"Back home, I've got pretty much everything."
01:00:35.500,01:00:36.500,But here...
01:00:37.458,01:00:38.750,I'm just...
01:00:38.833,01:00:41.458,"another irrelevant, pointless..."
01:00:43.416,01:00:44.375,nobody.
01:00:46.375,01:00:49.041,"But Klaus, he doesn't deserve..."
01:00:49.125,01:00:50.416,I didn't mean to...
01:00:51.125,01:00:53.583,"Well, now I just feel like a... I've behaved like a..."
01:00:57.500,01:01:00.791,"Hey. You're a pretty good listener, you know?"
01:01:04.250,01:01:06.625,"All right, you win."
01:01:08.541,01:01:09.666,Let's go. Follow me.
01:01:14.083,01:01:19.041,"Sorry to bother you this late, but, by any chance, would you happen to understand... this?"
01:01:25.541,01:01:27.750,Okay. Come in.
01:01:33.333,01:01:35.583,All right. Let's get started.
01:01:43.000,01:01:43.875,"Oh, oh, oh!"
01:01:43.958,01:01:45.458,She said she'd like a boat!
01:01:45.541,01:01:47.666,"-Really? -No, that can't be right. Scratch that."
01:01:49.666,01:01:51.958,"-Yes, yes, yes. -What?"
01:03:01.625,01:03:02.458,Huh?
01:03:20.083,01:03:21.541,"-Klaus, I-- -Uh."
01:04:55.833,01:04:57.208,Yoo-hoo!
01:05:18.750,01:05:23.541,Looks like someone might need help mailing letters.
01:05:23.625,01:05:24.625,Yeah.
01:05:25.250,01:05:26.583,"-Who? -I, I..."
01:05:26.666,01:05:27.666,I mean...
01:05:28.375,01:05:31.083,How have we never defeated you?
01:05:34.000,01:05:37.416,"when she got on the sled, I thought, Oh, no! We made it too small."
01:05:37.500,01:05:39.916,But no! It was just right for her size.
01:05:41.666,01:05:43.583,I think she did. Do you think she loved it?
01:05:44.583,01:05:45.958,-I do. -Yeah.
01:05:46.041,01:05:48.125,"Me too. Me too. Yeah, she loved it."
01:05:49.500,01:05:55.291,"You know, I remember the day I first had that very same smile on my face."
01:05:55.375,01:06:00.166,What? What smile? I wasn't smiling. I was squinting. From the sun.
01:06:00.250,01:06:01.333,Right.
01:06:01.833,01:06:03.958,I didn't want to admit it at first either.
01:06:06.500,01:06:07.458,She?
01:06:08.541,01:06:09.875,My Lydia.
01:06:10.666,01:06:14.625,I remember when I found this spot in the woods that she loved.
01:06:15.541,01:06:18.125,And I built us a house right here.
01:06:20.125,01:06:21.125,Away from it all.
01:06:22.708,01:06:25.208,But it wasn't gonna be the two of us for long.
01:06:29.958,01:06:30.958,We wanted children.
01:06:32.708,01:06:33.541,Lots of them.
01:06:34.166,01:06:36.625,"Running around, laughing, getting in trouble."
01:06:42.458,01:06:46.125,"While we waited, I started making toys for them."
01:06:46.708,01:06:51.125,"And we waited, and I kept making toys and more toys."
01:06:52.375,01:06:54.041,Oh! Here's another one. What do you think?
01:06:54.125,01:06:58.708,"And we kept waiting, but they never came..."
01:07:01.666,01:07:02.666,And then...
01:07:05.583,01:07:07.250,she got sick.
01:07:12.458,01:07:15.416,Even now... sometimes...
01:07:16.375,01:07:19.291,it almost feels like she's still...
01:07:25.291,01:07:32.291,"After... After she was gone, I... I guess I got lost."
01:07:33.458,01:07:38.625,"She loved birds, so I just kept making birdhouses."
01:07:40.708,01:07:41.625,But then...
01:07:42.208,01:07:43.916,Then you showed up.
01:07:44.583,01:07:51.666,"Delivering these toys, seeing the joy they bring to children, I thought I'd never feel this again."
01:07:52.291,01:07:55.333,"And I have you to thank for it, my friend."
01:07:55.916,01:07:57.916,So... thank you.
01:07:59.500,01:08:00.333,Of course.
01:08:02.000,01:08:04.208,"-Hey, you know what? We're doing it! -What?"
01:08:04.791,01:08:06.458,-Doing what? -The Christmas thing!
01:08:06.541,01:08:08.250,We're making all those toys!
01:08:08.333,01:08:10.041,-That's what she would've wanted. -Really?
01:08:10.125,01:08:15.416,"Yeah, really! And with a whole year of planning, -we can expand to more villages next year. -Next year?"
01:08:15.500,01:08:17.291,-And more the year after that! -But I won't...
01:08:17.375,01:08:19.083,"I mean, who knows what's gonna happen next year?"
01:08:19.166,01:09:06.791,"I might not even-- All right, that's it for today."
01:09:06.875,01:09:08.291,"And, um... homework!"
01:09:08.375,01:09:10.500,Oh! Uh... I forgot about homework.
01:09:12.125,01:09:13.750,Am I the best teacher ever or what?
01:09:13.833,01:09:14.708,What...
01:09:15.375,01:09:16.541,-happened here? -Oh.
01:09:17.250,01:09:20.083,"Yeah, I thought I would give the place an update."
01:09:20.166,01:09:22.666,Everybody knows rotting fish is so over.
01:09:22.750,01:09:24.375,How did you pay for this?
01:09:24.458,01:09:25.666,Hmm?
01:09:25.750,01:09:29.083,"-Your savings? -Well, not all of it."
01:09:29.166,01:09:31.250,"Actually, yeah, all of it. But check it out."
01:09:31.333,01:09:32.458,I think it looks pretty good.
01:09:32.541,01:09:35.666,"What about starting far, far away from here?"
01:09:35.750,01:09:36.708,Where's that Alva?
01:09:36.791,01:09:41.791,Someone would have to be pretty stupid Don't you think?
01:09:42.500,01:09:44.083,I... guess.
01:09:45.416,01:09:47.291,"You guess? Oh, wow."
01:09:47.375,01:09:49.750,"You have no idea what you've done, do you?"
01:09:50.250,01:09:52.083,Ugh. Come on. I'll show you.
01:09:58.333,01:10:00.208,"Now, would you take a look at that?"
01:10:18.000,01:10:19.208,"Merry Christmas, Miss. Alva!"
01:10:19.291,01:10:20.541,"-Merry Christmas, Mr. Postman! -Merry Christmas."
01:10:20.625,01:10:21.958,"Good evening, Postman Johanssen."
01:10:22.041,01:10:23.708,-Hello. -Miss. Alva.
01:10:52.041,01:10:53.333,What're you doing here?
01:11:03.750,01:11:05.833,"A true act of goodwill, huh?"
01:11:05.916,01:11:07.625,Always sparks another.
01:11:08.208,01:11:09.125,Never fails.
01:11:09.916,01:11:12.833,"Remember, put the letter in the envelope."
01:11:12.916,01:11:15.166,-And pass it down the line. -Come on! It doesn't have to rhyme.
01:11:17.500,01:11:19.166,No extra points for good spelling.
01:11:29.375,01:11:30.666,Whoa!
01:11:30.750,01:11:32.875,"Steady, ol' girl! Easy does it."
01:11:35.791,01:11:36.791,"Oh, wow!"
01:11:41.708,01:11:45.041,Uh-huh. Smooth lines. Good. Nice work.
01:11:46.750,01:11:47.666,Hello!
01:11:48.541,01:11:49.375,Hi.
01:11:53.875,01:11:56.000,"What am I supposed to do, huh?"
01:12:02.958,01:12:04.625,Hanging out with an old woodsman?
01:12:10.791,01:12:12.333,Surrounded by crazy people?
01:12:37.166,01:12:38.833,Never wanting anything more?
01:12:53.666,01:13:09.166,"Okay, are you gonna do that part or-- How about you finish these and-- They insisted, and I didn't want to be rude."
01:13:09.250,01:13:11.500,I don't know... What do you... Pfft. It's a lot of red.
01:13:11.583,01:13:12.916,What do you... Is it too much?
01:13:14.500,01:13:17.208,We'll just blindfold the reindeer so they don't get dizzy.
01:13:18.541,01:13:19.500,I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
01:13:19.583,01:13:22.000,It looks great. It looks good. It's nice. It's...
01:13:22.083,01:13:23.291,"Hello, Jesper."
01:13:23.375,01:13:24.791,Dad? What?
01:13:28.000,01:13:29.458,It's a little cramped in here.
01:13:32.125,01:13:33.500,"Dad, what're you doing here?"
01:13:33.583,01:13:40.916,"Time isn't up yet. I've still got a few days until-- Well, I had to come and see it for myself."
01:13:41.000,01:13:42.708,"Dad, you can't just show up and..."
01:13:42.791,01:13:44.583,"Wait, what? 14,000?"
01:13:47.208,01:13:49.333,Don't be so modest.
01:13:49.416,01:13:50.458,What're they doing here?
01:13:50.541,01:13:53.250,They were the ones who alerted me to what you've accomplished here.
01:13:53.333,01:13:56.541,We couldn't let such a feat go unrewarded.
01:13:56.625,01:14:00.000,"Listen, whatever they told you-- Well, then, ready to go?"
01:14:00.083,01:14:01.458,Go? Where?
01:14:03.875,01:14:07.125,A deal's a deal. The ordeal is over.
01:14:08.125,01:14:08.958,Home?
01:14:09.458,01:14:12.333,With the personal butler and the breakfast in bed and...
01:14:13.166,01:14:14.250,my silk sheets?
01:14:14.333,01:14:16.541,No one deserves it more.
01:14:16.625,01:14:20.291,"Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Klaus?"
01:14:22.916,01:14:25.500,"Oh, he was unbelievable!"
01:14:25.583,01:14:29.125,Encouraging children to write letters and go to school!
01:14:32.375,01:14:34.666,such a worthy cause.
01:14:37.041,01:14:38.750,"Well, shall we then?"
01:14:40.541,01:14:43.458,"Perhaps a minute to say your goodbyes, of course."
01:14:47.041,01:14:48.833,"Please, I can explain."
01:14:48.916,01:14:50.916,"-I was-- -Oh, it's very clear."
01:14:51.000,01:14:55.625,You just duped everyone so you could get back to your puffed-up life back in the big town.
01:14:55.708,01:14:56.583,Something like that?
01:14:56.666,01:15:01.583,"No! No. Well, at first maybe, yes, but, Alva, please come..."
01:15:01.666,01:15:02.666,"Alva, please come back."
01:15:02.750,01:15:06.625,"If I, I didn’t get the letters, I’d be cut off, but things changed!"
01:15:08.500,01:15:09.833,Jesper!
01:15:14.583,01:15:18.583,"Klaus, just listen. I-- Everybody's out to get something, right?"
01:15:42.083,01:15:53.750,"well, a bit of hardship might help straighten you out, but even I must admit that-- Well, let's just say that there's certainly a bright future for the man who brought postal service to Smeerensburg, that's for sure."
01:15:53.833,01:15:57.083,"And speaking of the future, I look forward to discussing..."
01:16:01.541,01:16:04.125,"One down, one to go."
01:16:06.000,01:16:10.416,"If you ask me who right now, I swear!"
01:16:26.541,01:16:29.333,"Well, now, finally leaving, aren't we?"
01:16:32.166,01:16:33.250,"Anchors away, Captain."
01:16:33.333,01:16:35.958,"-We're sailing off at once. -Well, that's a first."
01:16:36.041,01:16:36.958,I beg your pardon?
01:16:37.041,01:16:41.291,Never saw a postman looking more miserable leaving than on the day they came in.
01:16:42.750,01:16:45.083,"Oh, well. Best leave it alone, I say."
01:16:45.166,01:16:50.208,I'm sure it's nothing that could fester and eventually become a source of resentment and regret.
01:17:37.958,01:17:39.208,"Cheer up, little one."
01:17:41.625,01:17:43.375,I think I may have missed my boat.
01:17:52.166,01:17:54.666,"And then he turned to me, and he said..."
01:17:57.208,01:17:59.833,And he hugged me. Can you believe that?
01:17:59.916,01:18:01.125,I thought he'd be mad.
01:18:04.083,01:18:05.500,"Well, yeah, sure. I'll miss it."
01:18:05.583,01:18:09.916,"The big house, the having my every whim tended to, the silk sheets."
01:18:10.000,01:18:12.750,"Oh, God, the silk sheets! Can we change the subject?"
01:18:15.208,01:18:17.666,"Anyways, anybody can get off a boat."
01:18:17.750,01:18:22.458,The real trick is gonna be convincing Klaus and Alva to give me an-- What? What's that?
01:18:24.875,01:18:25.833,It's the clans!
01:18:27.833,01:18:28.958,Klaus!
01:18:39.458,01:18:41.791,Slowly. Slowly.
01:18:41.875,01:18:42.958,A little bit...
01:18:50.125,01:18:51.875,Isn't this convenient?
01:18:54.041,01:18:55.291,What're you doing here?
01:18:55.375,01:19:01.250,"Why, we were just thinking, Don't our children also deserve a present?"
01:19:01.333,01:19:02.583,And lookie here!
01:19:02.666,01:19:05.041,You've already got her favorite thing in the world.
01:19:05.125,01:19:07.375,"A nice, big piñata!"
01:19:09.708,01:19:13.250,...one hand on those toys and I swear I-- Stand back. All right.
01:19:13.333,01:19:15.333,Do what you will with the toys.
01:19:15.416,01:19:16.875,But no one gets hurt.
01:19:16.958,01:19:19.208,Suits us just fine.
01:19:20.500,01:19:26.833,How long until children go back to the old ways once there are no toys to bribe them with?
01:19:27.416,01:19:29.958,How long until they turn against each other?
01:19:30.791,01:19:35.458,And how long until the grown-ups follow?
01:19:46.000,01:19:47.125,Jesper?
01:19:47.208,01:19:48.291,The postman!
01:19:52.708,01:19:54.250,"Ha! Eat our snow, you..."
01:19:54.916,01:19:56.875,They're not attached. Why aren't they attached?
01:19:56.958,01:19:57.958,I thought they were attached.
01:19:58.041,01:20:02.541,"I would never, in a million years, have done what I just did if I didn't think these were attached."
01:20:02.625,01:20:03.666,After them!
01:20:03.750,01:20:07.250,Who leaves a sleigh unattached like... Aah!
01:20:07.333,01:20:08.541,Destroy those toys!
01:20:08.625,01:20:10.875,-Stop them at any cost! -Mine!
01:20:10.958,01:20:13.583,Mine! Mine!
01:20:20.666,01:20:23.583,Mine!
01:20:30.208,01:20:32.541,I could really use a hand here.
01:20:32.625,01:20:35.208,Use. Interesting choice of word.
01:20:35.291,01:20:37.708,Really? You're gonna go for the guilt trip now?
01:20:37.791,01:20:39.958,Smash those toys to pieces!
01:20:45.958,01:20:47.250,The toys!
01:20:47.333,01:20:49.666,-We have to close that bag! -What do you care?
01:20:49.750,01:20:52.791,-I thought you were leaving. -Great. Sure. I'll tell you what.
01:20:52.875,01:21:01.458,"Let's continue discussing what a horrible person I am while I most likely break my neck trying to save the children's toys, -why don't we? -Get down there!"
01:21:05.041,01:21:06.708,Uh... Klaus?
01:21:07.541,01:21:08.541,Hmm.
01:21:17.041,01:21:20.041,Nice move! How'd you know I wouldn't get knocked off too?
01:21:20.125,01:21:21.833,Never mind. Don't answer that.
01:21:25.041,01:21:27.208,Go! Go! We're dead! We're dead! We're dead!
01:21:27.291,01:21:28.541,Mine!
01:21:35.291,01:21:37.458,"I'm still proud of you, you hear me?"
01:21:44.291,01:21:45.833,Mine?
01:21:54.083,01:21:55.833,We're losing toys!
01:22:25.375,01:22:27.333,Jesper! Let go!
01:22:27.416,01:22:30.041,-It's not worth it! -Are you crazy? No!
01:22:40.625,01:22:43.041,See? Nothing to it. Just...
01:22:47.458,01:22:48.958,"Wait! No, no, no!"
01:22:49.458,01:22:54.791,"No! No, no, no! No!"
01:23:00.916,01:23:05.083,This town was built on resentment and spite.
01:23:05.166,01:23:08.083,And it'll stay that way as long as a Krum...
01:23:08.166,01:23:09.375,Or an Ellingboe!
01:23:09.458,01:23:10.291,Ugh.
01:23:10.375,01:23:12.750,...have something to say about it.
01:23:13.250,01:23:16.000,Let's go. We're done here.
01:23:18.916,01:23:20.166,No more truce?
01:23:25.416,01:23:26.416,What was that?
01:23:31.291,01:23:33.583,A true act of goodwill...
01:23:34.625,01:23:36.333,always sparks another.
01:23:37.041,01:23:39.375,"I think you hit your head pretty hard, dear."
01:23:39.458,01:23:40.916,You should lie back down.
01:23:41.500,01:23:43.916,You don't believe me? Turn around.
01:23:44.000,01:23:45.125,What?
01:23:45.750,01:23:46.833,Turn around.
01:23:52.166,01:23:53.375,-Pumpkin! -Honey!
01:23:53.458,01:23:55.208,-Drop that immediately! -Mine!
01:24:03.625,01:24:05.333,"Klaus, I don't know what to say."
01:24:05.916,01:24:06.875,If I hadn't...
01:24:11.708,01:24:12.750,What's this?
01:24:20.750,01:24:23.041,The presents in the sleigh were all fake?
01:24:25.041,01:24:27.166,I wasn't going to let them have the toys.
01:24:27.250,01:24:29.666,"-But how did you know that-- -Kids talk, you know?"
01:24:29.750,01:24:35.583,"And if kids happen to be talking about their parents plotting to form an angry mob, then, you know, teachers listen."
01:24:35.666,01:24:36.875,It was a simple plan.
01:24:40.916,01:24:44.041,But then you showed up and made it complicated. As usual.
01:24:44.125,01:24:45.750,"So, all this was for nothing?"
01:24:46.541,01:24:48.625,"Oh, I wouldn't say that."
01:24:53.500,01:24:54.500,Shall we then?
01:25:15.833,01:25:17.583,He came! He came!
01:25:19.041,01:25:20.625,-Yeah! -Mine's the big one!
01:25:23.166,01:25:25.458,I told you! I told you he would come!
01:25:25.541,01:25:27.333,"Mom! Come here, quick!"
01:25:28.166,01:25:29.333,-Yes! -Yeah!
01:25:29.416,01:25:31.708,-It's just what I wanted! -He came! He came! He came!
01:25:31.791,01:25:35.541,Dad! Mom! Wake up! You have to see this!
01:25:47.375,01:25:49.875,And Smeerensburg continued to change for the better.
01:25:57.208,01:25:58.500,"Poetic, don't you think?"
01:26:01.250,01:26:02.416,As for Alva and I...
01:26:04.416,01:26:08.583,"well, what'd you expect? Of course she loved me."
01:26:15.125,01:26:18.583,"Every year, come the Christmas season, the letters started pouring in."
01:26:19.083,01:26:21.916,"More and more each time, and from farther away."
01:26:22.000,01:26:25.083,"We did have to expand the operation, just like we had planned."
01:26:25.916,01:26:29.333,"More children, more toys, more towns."
01:26:35.416,01:26:37.666,It's so bright you can even see at night.
01:26:37.750,01:26:40.958,"Oh, look over there! See the red and yellow along the rim?"
01:26:45.458,01:26:47.625,Any chance for a hot cup of coffee for your neighborhood mailman?
01:26:52.000,01:26:53.416,What is on your face?
01:26:53.500,01:26:56.208,"What? You don't like it? I think it looks good on me, don't you?"
01:27:02.041,01:27:04.708,"And then, on the 12th year..."
01:27:25.041,01:27:26.583,"I'm coming, love."
01:28:22.916,01:28:26.291,"I asked everyone, but we just couldn't find him."
01:28:27.750,01:28:28.625,No goodbye.
01:28:29.958,01:28:31.416,No explanation.
01:28:31.500,01:28:32.416,Nothing.
01:28:32.916,01:28:34.458,It was as if he had just...
01:28:36.666,01:28:37.916,faded away.
01:28:45.125,01:28:46.250,All right.
01:28:46.333,01:28:49.250,"I've got two urgent deliveries here, Postmaster, sir!"
01:28:49.333,01:28:51.000,The letters are getting in the envelope.
01:28:51.083,01:28:52.916,Proceed to stamp the letter.
01:28:57.666,01:28:59.416,"-Nighty night, kids! -Go to sleep, now."
01:29:22.250,01:29:24.416,"how, why..."
01:29:25.458,01:29:28.333,I can't even begin to comprehend.
01:29:29.291,01:29:32.333,I stopped trying to make sense of it a long time ago.
01:29:48.000,01:29:49.375,...is that once a year...
01:29:51.458,01:29:53.250,I get to see my friend.
