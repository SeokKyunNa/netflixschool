00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sir, can I get my drawing back?

trying to figure out how to get...

350
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:47.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, here's a thought.

351
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a postman, see?

352
00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:53.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I can't give it to you,
but I could mail it to you.

353
00:17:53.541 --> 00:17:55.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

354
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:58.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just fold your pretty drawing,
very beautiful by the way,

355
00:17:58.916 --> 00:18:00.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
put it in an envelope like this

356
00:18:00.666 --> 00:18:04.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then all that's left is postage
so I can put it in the mailbox for you.

357
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yep.

358
00:18:06.416 --> 00:18:09.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just toss a penny over to me
so I can stamp it,

359
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and we're all ready to go.

360
00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Couldn't you just put it in?

361
00:18:14.541 --> 00:18:16.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aw. Tsk.

362
00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:19.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really, really would, but I can't.

363
00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:22.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not a letter
if it doesn't have postage.

364
00:18:22.541 --> 00:18:23.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See how it works?

365
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what do you say?

366
00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:27.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I get my letter, and you get your drawing.

367
00:18:27.291 --> 00:18:29.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Win-win. You want your drawing, don't you?

368
00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:31.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Um...
-If you don't, I'm gonna keep it.

369
00:18:31.166 --> 00:18:32.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmm.
-I love it.

370
00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:33.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would keep it if I was you,

371
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I would send this letter
back to myself if I was you.

00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:15.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

974
00:53:32.416 --> 00:53:34.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

975
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I've got my own problems, you know?

986
00:54:15.041 --> 00:54:19.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, we are out of toys,
and without toys, there are no letters.

987
00:54:19.458 --> 00:54:20.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1004
00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:20.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where is your clan?

1005
00:55:23.833 --> 00:55:25.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1006
00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:30.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1007
00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:32.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1012
00:55:43.833 --> 00:55:47.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm saying it's time to join forces
against a common enemy.

1013
00:55:50.291 --> 00:55:53.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm saying we need a truce.

1014
00:55:53.333 --> 00:55:56.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1015
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Either we band together

00:55:59.041 --> 00:56:00.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:06.458 --> 00:56:11.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, we must join together in peace
