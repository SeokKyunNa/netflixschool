00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:58.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you'd remove the <i>Cadogan Guide</i>
<i>to Bali</i> from your trousers

95
00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:02.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and either wipe it
and put it back, or buy it.

96
00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll see you in a sec.

97
00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry about that.

98
00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it's fine.

99
00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:13.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was gonna steal one
but now I've changed my mind.

100
00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Signed by the author, I see.

101
00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, couldn't stop him.

102
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you can find an unsigned one,
it's worth an absolute fortune.

103
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

104
00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can I have your autograph?

105
00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:31.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sure.
-Here.

106
00:08:33.387 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's your name?
-Rufus.

107
00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:43.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What does it say?

108
00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's my signature, and above it,
it says "Dear Rufus, you belong in jail."

109
00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:49.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good one.

110
00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:53.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you want my phone number?

111
00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tempting, but no.

112
00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

113
00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will take this one.

114
00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:06.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, right, right.

115
00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:11.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, well, on second thoughts
maybe it's not that bad after all.

116
00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:14.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually it's a sort of classic, really.

117
00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:18.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
None of those childish kebab stories
you find in so many books these days.

118
00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I tell you what, I'll throw
in one of those for free.

119
00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:27.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Useful for lighting fires, wrapping fish,
that sort of thing.

120
00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:33.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks.
-Pleasure.

121
00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:45.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

122
00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:07.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here we are. Cappuccino, as ordered.

123
00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:10.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks.

124
00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think you'll believe
who was just in here.

125
00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who? Was it someone famous?

126
00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:20.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no, no.

127
00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:24.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would be exciting though, wouldn't it,
if someone famous came into the shop?

128
00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:31.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know, this is pretty amazing
actually, but I once saw Ringo Starr.

129
00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:34.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Where was that?
-Kensington High Street.

130
00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:35.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At least I think it was Ringo.

131
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:39.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It might have been that man
from <i>Fiddler On The Roof.</i>

132
00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:40.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, Toppy.

133
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:41.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Topol.

134
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:44.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, that's right. Topol.

135
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, Ringo Starr doesn't
look at all like Topol.

136
00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:52.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, but he was quite
a long way away from me.

137
00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:56.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So actually it could've
been neither of them?

138
00:10:57.698 --> 00:10:59.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, I suppose so, yes.

139
00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:01.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not a classic anecdote, is it?

140
00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:03.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a classic, no. No.

141
00:11:08.876 --> 00:11:09.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Another one?

142
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. No! Let's go crazy.
I'll have an orange juice.

143
00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.
-See you later.

144
00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:32.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

145
00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Shit! Bugger!
-Oh, my God!

146
00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

147
00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:37.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here let me...

148
00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:39.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get your hands off!

149
00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:42.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really sorry.
I live just over the street.

150
00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have water and soap.
You can get cleaned up.

151
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:48.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, thank you. I just
need to get my car back.

152
00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I also have a phone.

153
00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm confident that in five minutes

154
00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:53.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we can have you spick and span
and back on the street again.

155
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:56.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In the non-prostitute sense,
obviously.

156
00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:01.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

157
00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:05.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, what do you mean "just over
the street"? Give it to me in yards.

158
00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Eighteen yards. That's my house there
with the blue front door.

159
00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on in. I'll just, I'll just...

160
00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:20.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[mumbling]

161
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:23.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. Right.

162
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come in. It's not quite as tidy as it
normally is, I fear.

163
00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the bathroom's on the top floor.
And the telephone's just up here.

164
00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:38.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here, let me...

165
00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:48.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Round the corner,
straight on, straight on up.

166
00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bugger!

167
00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:01.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exclaiming in disgust]

168
00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:18.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?

169
00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:20.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

170
00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:23.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Coffee?
-No.

171
00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:24.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Orange juice?

172
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Probably not.

173
00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:30.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something else cold?

174
00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:35.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Coke? Water?

175
00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some disgusting sugary drink

176
00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:40.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
pretending to have something to do with
fruits of the forest?

177
00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:41.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

178
00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:43.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you like something to eat?

179
00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:49.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Something to nibble?
Apricots soaked in honey?

180
00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:51.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite why, no one knows,

181
00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:56.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it stops them tasting of apricots
and makes them taste like honey,

182
00:13:56.585 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and if you wanted honey you'd
just buy honey instead of apricots.

183
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But nevertheless, there we go,
they're yours if you want them.

184
00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:07.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

185
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you always say "no" to everything?

186
00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:16.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

187
00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:23.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd better be going.
Thanks for your, uh, help.

188
00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:25.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're welcome.

189
00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And may I also say, um, heavenly.

190
00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:34.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll just take my one chance to say it.

191
00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:35.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After you've read
that terrible book

192
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you're certainly not gonna
be coming back to the shop.

193
00:14:39.753 --> 00:14:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

194
00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, well, my pleasure.

00:14:56.854 --> 00:15:00.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So...it was nice to meet you.

196
00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:05.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Surreal, but nice.

197
00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:08.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

198
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:20.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Surreal, but nice."
What was I thinking?

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:34.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hi.

00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:39.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:26:54.487 --> 00:26:55.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

354
00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:21.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:25.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

356
00:27:26.644 --> 00:27:32.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:44.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it was difficult,
obviously, being set in space.

360
00:27:46.206 --> 00:27:49.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Yeah, obviously very difficult.

00:27:51.461 --> 00:27:52.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:14.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is a cheap question

00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:29.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:13.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Well, I don't know.

633
00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:10.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at William.

634
00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very unsuccessful professionally.

635
00:42:13.072 --> 00:42:14.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's true.
-Divorced.

636
00:42:15.658 --> 00:42:18.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Used to be handsome, now kind of squidgy
round the edges.

638
00:42:20.496 --> 00:42:22.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And absolutely certain
never to hear from Anna again

639
00:42:22.665 --> 00:42:25.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
once she's heard that his
nickname at school was Floppy.

640
00:42:26.335 --> 00:42:28.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You did. I can't believe it, you did.

641
00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:31.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks very much. Thank you.

642
00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:32.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well at least I get
the last brownie, right?

643
00:42:32.925 --> 00:42:34.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Max] I think so, yes.

644
00:42:34.301 --> 00:42:35.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, wait, what about me?

645
00:42:38.472 --> 00:42:39.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry?

646
00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:42.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think you deserve the brownie?

647
00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:46.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, a shot at it at least, huh?

648
00:42:46.605 --> 00:42:47.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, well, you'll have to prove it.

649
00:42:47.856 --> 00:42:51.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, this is a very, very good brownie
and I'm gonna fight for it.

650
00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:55.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been on a diet
every day since I was 19,

651
00:42:56.115 --> 00:42:59.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which basically means
I've been hungry for a decade.

652
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:04.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've had a series of not nice boyfriends,
one of whom hit me.

653
00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:08.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And every time
I get my heart broken,

654
00:43:08.377 --> 00:43:13.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the newspapers splash it about
as though it's entertainment.

655
00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:21.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's taken two rather painful
operations to get me looking like this.

656
00:43:22.057 --> 00:43:23.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really?
-Really.

657
00:43:27.605 --> 00:43:30.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And one day, not long from now,

658
00:43:30.899 --> 00:43:34.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
my looks will go,
they will discover I can't act,

659
00:43:35.321 --> 00:43:40.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I will become some sad,
middle-aged woman who

660
00:43:41.535 --> 00:43:44.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
looks a bit like someone
who was famous for a while.

661
00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:55.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, nice try, gorgeous,
but you don't fool anyone.

662
00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:57.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

663
00:43:58.052 --> 00:44:00.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pathetic effort
to hog the brownie.

664
00:44:01.972 --> 00:44:03.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you for such
a terrific time.

665
00:44:03.682 --> 00:44:04.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm delighted.

666
00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:08.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a great tie.

667
00:44:08.187 --> 00:44:09.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now you're lying.

668
00:44:09.855 --> 00:44:11.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, it's true. I told you
I was bad at acting.

669
00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was lovely to meet you.

670
00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:14.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. And you.

671
00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:17.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll wait until you've gone
before I tell him you're a vegetarian.

672
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:18.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No!

673
00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:23.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Goodnight.

674
00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:25.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry about the loo thing.

675
00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:27.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I meant to leave, but I just...

676
00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, ring me if you want
someone to go shopping with.

677
00:44:30.459 --> 00:44:32.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know lots of nice,
cheap places.

678
00:44:32.086 --> 00:44:34.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, not that
money is necessarily...

679
00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was just so
nice to meet you.

680
00:44:36.173 --> 00:44:37.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

681
00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:39.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're my style guru.

682
00:44:39.468 --> 00:44:40.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, can I just...

683
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks.

684
00:44:42.763 --> 00:44:43.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Leave her.

685
00:44:43.889 --> 00:44:45.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Anna] Goodnight, everyone.

686
00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:48.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[William] Max, Belle, we'll see
you in a couple of days.

687
00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:52.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Bella] Bye, guys.
-Bye, Anna.

688
00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Love your work.

689
00:44:54.483 --> 00:44:55.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[William] Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

691
00:45:03.784 --> 00:45:06.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry. They always do that
when I leave the house.

692
00:45:06.954 --> 00:45:10.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a stupid thing.
I hate it.

693
00:45:21.093 --> 00:45:22.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Floppy, huh?

694
00:45:22.678 --> 00:45:24.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the hair.
It's to do with the hair.

695
00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:30.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is she in a wheelchair?

696
00:45:31.353 --> 00:45:34.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because she had an accident
about 18 months ago.

697
00:45:35.858 --> 00:45:38.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the pregnancy thing,
is that to do with the accident?

698
00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:39.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, I'm not sure.

699
00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:42.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think they tried for kids before,
as fate would have it.

700
00:45:52.332 --> 00:45:53.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you want to...

701
00:45:55.669 --> 00:45:57.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My place is just...

702
00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:59.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Too complicated.

703
00:46:00.966 --> 00:46:01.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's fine.

704
00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:09.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Busy tomorrow?

705
00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:13.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought you were leaving tomorrow.

706
00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:14.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was.

707
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:19.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All these streets round here

708
00:46:19.943 --> 00:46:22.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
have these mysterious communal
gardens in the middle of them.

709
00:46:22.863 --> 00:46:23.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're like little villages.

710
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:25.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go in.

711
00:46:25.824 --> 00:46:27.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, that's the point.
They're private villages.

712
00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:30.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Only the people who live round
the edges are allowed in.

713
00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:33.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You abide by rules like that?

714
00:46:34.082 --> 00:46:36.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't, no, no,
but others do.

715
00:46:36.668 --> 00:46:38.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I just do what I want.

716
00:46:41.715 --> 00:46:42.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

720
00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:50.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did you say?

721
00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:53.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nothing.
-Yes, you did.

722
00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:55.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I didn't.

723
00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:57.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You said "whoopsidaisies."

724
00:46:57.898 --> 00:47:00.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No one says "whoopsidaisies,"
do they? I mean, unless they're...

725
00:47:00.692 --> 00:47:01.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is no "unless."

00:47:01.777 --> 00:47:04.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because no one has said
"whoopsidaisies" for 50 years.

727
00:47:04.112 --> 00:47:08.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And even then it was just little girls
with blonde ringlets.

728
00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:10.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Exactly. Right.

729
00:47:11.745 --> 00:47:13.121 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Yeah, well, it's a disease.
It's a clinical thing.

735
00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:25.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm taking pills and having injections.
And I'm told it won't last long so...

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:26.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

that's a good idea.

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

as soon as the lights went down.

775
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any film with her in, it's fine by me.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:37.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:51:38.178 --> 00:51:39.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

her out for a cup of coffee.

Meg Ryan.

782
00:51:44.142 --> 00:51:45.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, she's too wholesome.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:49.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You see, the point about Miss Scott
is she's got that twinkle in her eye.

784
00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:53.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably drug-induced. Spends most
of her life in bloody rehab.

785
00:51:53.527 --> 00:51:55.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, whatever.
She's so clearly up for it.

00:51:56.071 --> 00:51:58.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they're all like, "Stay away, chum."

00:51:59.032 --> 00:52:03.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

She is absolutely gagging for it.

00:52:04.913 --> 00:52:07.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

789
00:52:07.749 --> 00:52:10.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the word for "actress" is the same
as the word for "prostitute"?

790
00:52:11.002 --> 00:52:13.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[man] Where did you get that from?

00:52:15.173 --> 00:52:18.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

793
00:52:19.219 --> 00:52:23.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
someone really filthy you can just
flip over and start again.

00:52:24.766 --> 00:52:26.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, that's it. Sorry.

795
00:52:26.184 --> 00:52:28.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, no.
There's really no point.

796
00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:33.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, sorry to disturb you guys, but...

798
00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:34.901 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can I help?
-Well, yeah.

799
00:52:35.735 --> 00:52:38.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wish I hadn't overheard your

00:52:38.947 --> 00:52:44.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And, I just think, you know the person
you're talking about is a real person

801
00:52:44.369 --> 00:52:47.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think she probably deserves
a little bit more consideration

802
00:52:47.205 --> 00:52:50.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
rather than having jerks

803
00:52:50.959 --> 00:52:53.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

806
00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:06.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:53:16.151 --> 00:53:19.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just wanted to apologize for my friend.

810
00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:23.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, no, no, leave it. I'm sure you
didn't mean any harm.

811
00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:26.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure it was
just friendly banter.

00:53:26.202 --> 00:53:28.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Anna] I shouldn't have done that.
I shouldn't have done that.

00:53:38.256 --> 00:53:39.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:41.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:48.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:57.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

823
00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:09.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, there seems to be lots
of reasons why I shouldn't, so...

824
00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:11.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are lots of reasons.

825
00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:17.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

826
00:54:22.467 --> 00:54:24.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

828
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be able to do that
is such a wonderful thing.

830
00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:56.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because my boyfriend, who was in America,
is, in fact, now in the next room.

831
00:54:56.876 --> 00:54:58.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, baby, who is it?

833
00:54:59.921 --> 00:55:01.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Anna] It's...

834
00:55:03.508 --> 00:55:04.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

835
00:55:05.635 --> 00:55:06.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Room service.

836
00:55:07.012 --> 00:55:08.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. How are you doing?

837
00:55:09.014 --> 00:55:11.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought you guys always
wore those penguin coats?

838
00:55:12.851 --> 00:55:14.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Usually we do.

839
00:55:14.686 --> 00:55:16.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I was just
changed to go home.

840
00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:21.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then I thought
I'd take this final call.

841
00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:24.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, great. If you don't mind,
I would like something, too.

842
00:55:24.696 --> 00:55:27.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could you bring me up some
really, really cold water?

843
00:55:28.575 --> 00:55:29.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll see what I can do.

844
00:55:30.035 --> 00:55:31.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still, not sparkling.

845

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:05.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And?

955
01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:10.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You see, I think you've forgotten
what an unusual situation you two have.

956
01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:15.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To find someone
you actually love,

957
01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:19.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who'll love you, I mean,
the chances are always minuscule.

958
01:04:22.149 --> 01:04:24.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at me.
Apart from the American,

959
01:04:25.319 --> 01:04:27.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've only loved two girls,
both total disasters.

960
01:04:28.072 --> 01:04:29.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's not fair.
-No, really.

961
01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:33.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One of them marries me then leaves me
faster than you can say "Indiana Jones."

962
01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:37.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the other, who seriously
ought to have known better,

963
01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
casually marries
my best friend.

964
01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:40.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She still loves you though.

965
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, in a depressingly
asexual way.

966
01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:47.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never fancied
you much, actually.

969
01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:57.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I loved you, you were terribly funny,
but all that kissing my ears...

970
01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't believe it.
This is just getting worse.

01:04:59.937 --> 01:05:03.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

01:05:04.817 --> 01:05:05.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

973
01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, why not.

974
01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:11.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All that awaits me at home
is a masturbating Welshman.

01:05:15.119 --> 01:05:16.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:18.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

977
01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Night.

978
01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:28.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:05:38.225 --> 01:05:39.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See you, Will.

981
01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:40.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. Right.

982
01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:51.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Guilty. Very, very guilty.

983
01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:53.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it seems.

984
01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:36.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:06:41.205 --> 01:06:42.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi.

986
01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:46.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can I come in?

987
01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:48.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come in.

988
01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:58.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They were taken years ago.

989
01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:01.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know it was...

990
01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:06.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I was poor
and it happens a lot.

991
01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:09.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's not an excuse.
I just...

992
01:07:12.486 --> 01:07:17.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But to make matters worse,
it now appears as though

993
01:07:19.076 --> 01:07:21.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
someone was filming
me as well.

994
01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:28.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what was a stupid photo shoot now
looks like a porn film.

995
01:07:31.338 --> 01:07:36.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the pictures have been sold,
and they're just everywhere.

996
01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:42.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't know where to go.

997
01:07:44.977 --> 01:07:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The hotel's surrounded.

998
01:07:50.941 --> 01:07:52.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know it's been months, but...

999
01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the place.

1000
01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:00.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1001
01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:10.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just in London for two days,
but what with your papers,

1002
01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:11.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's the worst place to be.

1003
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:17.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, these pictures are just
so horrible and they're so grainy.

1004
01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:18.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it makes me look like...

1005
01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:20.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Listen, don't think about it.

1006
01:08:23.307 --> 01:08:24.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll sort it out.

1007
01:08:28.521 --> 01:08:29.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now what would you like?

1008
01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:33.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tea? Bath?

1009
01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:36.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1010
01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bath would be great.

1011
01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:42.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1012
01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:46.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Christ alive!

1013
01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Brilliant. Fantastic.

1014
01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:58.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Magnificent.

1015
01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You must be Spike.

1016
01:09:21.615 --> 01:09:22.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi.

1017
01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:25.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just checking.

1018
01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:33.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, God.

1019
01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:39.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really sorry
about last time.

1020
01:09:40.759 --> 01:09:43.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, he just flew in.
I had no idea.

1021
01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:47.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In fact, I had no idea if he
was ever gonna fly in again.

1022
01:09:49.226 --> 01:09:52.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Listen, it's not often
one has the opportunity to

1023
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:54.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1024
01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was thrilling for me.

1025
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So how is he?

1026
01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:06.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

1027
01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just got to the point
where I couldn't remember

1028
01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:14.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
any of the reasons
why we were together.

1029
01:10:16.795 --> 01:10:18.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you and love?

1030
01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:26.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, well, there's a question
without an interesting answer.

1031
01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:33.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have thought about you.

1032
01:10:37.524 --> 01:10:41.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just that any time I've tried to keep

1033
01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:46.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
anything normal
with a person that was normal,

1034
01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:48.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's just been a disaster.

1035
01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:50.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, no, listen,
I appreciate that, absolutely.

1036
01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:54.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what is that,
a film you're doing?

1037
01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1038
01:10:59.713 --> 01:11:02.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you like me to
take you through your lines?

1039
01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:05.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you? Because it's
all talk, talk, talk.

1040
01:11:06.387 --> 01:11:10.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, hand it over. Right.

1041
01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:12.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Basic plot?

1042
01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:17.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior
officer, who in about 20 minutes

is gonna save the world
from nuclear disaster.

1044
01:11:21.485 --> 01:11:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, well done, you.

1045

would you like them to send in the HK's?"

1046
01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:27.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. Turn over four TRS's

1047
01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:31.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and tell them we need radar
feedback before the KFT's return at 19:00.

1048
01:11:31.495 --> 01:11:33.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then inform the Pentagon
we need Black Star cover

1049
01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:35.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:36.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And if you say one word about

1051
01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:38.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
how many mistakes I made in
that speech, I'll pelt you with olives.

1052
01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:40.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Very well, Captain, I'll pass that on,
straight away."

1053
01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:42.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you.
How many mistakes did I make?

1054
01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:43.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eleven.

01:11:44.174 --> 01:11:46.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dammit. And, Wainwright...

1056

Cartwright, Wainwright,
whatever your name is...

1058
01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:52.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I promised little Jimmy
I'd be home for his birthday,

1059
01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:54.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so could you get a message to him
that I may be a little late?

"Certainly."
And little Johnny?

1061
01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:59.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-My son's name is Johnny?
-Yeah.

1062
01:12:00.065 --> 01:12:01.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, then get
a message to him, too.

1063
01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:04.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"I'll do what I can, Captain,
but I can't promise anything."

1064
01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:06.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And, Cartwright goes.

1065
01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:07.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1066
01:12:09.116 --> 01:12:10.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think?

1067
01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:13.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gripping. You know,
it's not Jane Austen.

1068
01:12:13.537 --> 01:12:16.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not Henry James.
But it's gripping.

1069
01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:18.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think I should do
Henry James instead?

1070
01:12:18.542 --> 01:12:20.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I think you would be
brilliant in Henry James.

1071
01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:23.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But, you know, this writer... Writers...

1072
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:25.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're pretty damn good, too.

1073
01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:27.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you never get anyone
in <i>Wings of the Dove</i> saying,

1074
01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:30.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Inform the Pentagon,
we need Black Star cover."

1075
01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:33.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, and for me,
the book is the poorer for it.

1076
01:12:38.395 --> 01:12:40.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't believe you
have that picture.

1077
01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:43.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You like Chagall?

1078
01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:45.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do.

1079
01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:49.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It feels like how love should be.

1080
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:52.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1081
01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:55.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With a goat, playing a violin.

1082
01:12:55.996 --> 01:12:56.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, yes.

1083
01:12:57.373 --> 01:13:00.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Happiness isn't happiness
without a violin-playing goat.

1084
01:13:22.147 --> 01:13:23.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have big feet.

1085
01:13:25.984 --> 01:13:29.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Yes, always have had.

1086
01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:35.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know what they say
about men with big feet?

1087
01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I don't know. What's that?

1088
01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:45.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Big feet, large shoes.

1089
01:13:51.635 --> 01:13:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The thing that's so irritating is that now

1090
01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:56.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm so totally fierce when
it comes to nudity clauses.

1091
01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:59.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You actually have clauses
in your contract about nudity?

1092
01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:00.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Definitely.

1093
01:14:01.311 --> 01:14:05.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You may show the dent of the top of
the artist's buttocks but neither cheek.

1094
01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:10.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or, if there's a stunt bottom being used,
artist must have full consultation.

1095
01:14:11.905 --> 01:14:13.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have a stunt bottom?

1096
01:14:13.198 --> 01:14:16.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I could have a stunt bottom, yes.

1097
01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:20.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And are people tempted to go
for better bottoms than their own?

1098
01:14:20.914 --> 01:14:24.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I mean, I would.
This is important stuff.

1099
01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:28.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it's one hell of a job, isn't it?
I mean, what do you put on your passport?

1100
01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:30.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Profession.
Mel Gibson's bottom.

1101
01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:32.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, Mel does his own ass work.

1102
01:14:33.051 --> 01:14:34.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

1103
01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why wouldn't he?

1104
01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:36.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely.

1105
01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's delicious.

1106
01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:42.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What, the ice cream
or Mel Gibson's bottom?

1107
01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:44.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Both. Equally.

1108
01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:48.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you wouldn't
necessarily lick both?

1109
01:14:48.275 --> 01:14:49.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, this is tart.

1110
01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And fuzz free.

1111
01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:03.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And... The bedroom,
I've put clean sheets on.

1112
01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:16.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Today's been a good day.

1113
01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which in the circumstances is unexpected.

1114
01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:23.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1115
01:15:28.565 --> 01:15:32.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anyway, time for bed.

1116
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or, sofa bed.

1117
01:15:43.163 --> 01:15:44.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Goodnight.

1118
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:45.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Goodnight.

1122
01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello?

1123
01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:47.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello.

1124
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:49.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Spike?

1125
01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:53.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder if I could have a little word?

1126
01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:54.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

1127
01:16:54.359 --> 01:16:55.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't want to interfere or nothing,

1128
01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:58.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but she's just split up from
her boyfriend. That's right, innit?

1129
01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:00.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe.

1130
01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:02.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And she's in your house.

1131
01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes?

1132
01:17:05.662 --> 01:17:07.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you get on very well.

1133
01:17:09.249 --> 01:17:10.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

1134
01:17:10.917 --> 01:17:14.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, isn't this perhaps
a nice opportunity to

1135
01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:19.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
slip her one?

1136
01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:21.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Spike, for God's sake. She's in trouble.

1137
01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:22.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just get a grip.

1138
01:17:22.262 --> 01:17:24.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

fair enough.

-Spike!
-Right, okay.

1141
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:34.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll talk to you in the morning.

1142
01:17:35.525 --> 01:17:38.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Might be too late, but okay.

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:52.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please, sod off.

1147
01:17:54.378 --> 01:17:59.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, no, no, wait,
I thought you were someone else.

1148
01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:03.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought you were Spike.
I'm thrilled that you're not.

1149
01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:07.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

1150
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:11.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

1151
01:19:13.039 --> 01:19:14.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing.

1152
01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:55.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does strike me as, well, surreal
that I'm allowed to see you naked.

1153
01:19:55.665 --> 01:19:57.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You and every person in this country.

1154
01:19:57.834 --> 01:19:59.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God, yeah, I'm sorry.

1155
01:20:00.378 --> 01:20:05.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What is it about men and nudity, huh?
Particularly breasts.

1156
01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:08.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And how can you be so interested in them?

1157
01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well...

1158
01:20:10.096 --> 01:20:12.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, but seriously. They're just breasts.

1159
01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:15.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Every second person in the world has them.

1160
01:20:15.352 --> 01:20:17.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, more than that, actually, when you
think about it.

1161
01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:19.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair.

1162
01:20:20.607 --> 01:20:24.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1163
01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:27.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your mother has them.
You've seen a thousand of them.

1164
01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:29.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's all the fuss about?

1165
01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually,
I can't think what it is, really.

1166
01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:34.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Hi, here we go.
Volume's on the side.

1385
01:37:34.181 --> 01:37:35.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1386
01:37:37.059 --> 01:37:38.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God, that's an enormous arse.

1387
01:37:38.852 --> 01:37:40.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Anna] <i>I'm not listening.</i>

1388

1389
01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:45.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So many tragic young
teenagers with anorexia,

1390
01:37:45.776 --> 01:37:47.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that girl has an arse
she could perfectly well share around

1391
01:37:47.945 --> 01:37:51.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with at least 10 other women,
and still be big bottomed.

1392
01:37:51.949 --> 01:37:53.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would think, looking at
something nice like that,

1393
01:37:54.076 --> 01:37:58.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you and your bony
little excuse for an arse

1394
01:37:58.497 --> 01:38:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
would be well advised to keep quiet.

1395
01:38:01.208 --> 01:38:03.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, down to business,
the end of the scene.

1396
01:38:03.586 --> 01:38:06.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I ask you when you're telling
everyone, and you say...

1397
01:38:07.965 --> 01:38:09.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Tomorrow will be soon enough."

1398
01:38:10.593 --> 01:38:12.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then I... Right, okay.

1399
01:38:13.637 --> 01:38:16.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So who was that rather diffident chap
I saw you talking to round the back?

1400
01:38:17.224 --> 01:38:18.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No one.

1401
01:38:20.686 --> 01:38:22.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just some guy from the past.

1402
01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:25.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit of an awkward situation really.

1403
01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:26.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what he's doing here.

1404
01:38:44.376 --> 01:38:45.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course.

1405
01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:49.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1406
01:38:52.468 --> 01:38:55.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks, I've got to...

1407
01:38:55.346 --> 01:38:56.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any time.

1408
01:39:07.066 --> 01:39:08.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[man] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:27.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do hate to disturb you whilst
you're cooking the books,

1412
01:39:28.045 --> 01:39:30.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but there's
a delivery for you.

1413
01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:33.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Martin, really,
can't you just do it yourself?

1414
01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:37.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you see, this is not for the shop.
This is for you.

1415
01:39:39.848 --> 01:39:40.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, okay.

1416
01:39:41.183 --> 01:39:43.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now tell me, if I employed a wet rag,

1417
01:39:43.185 --> 01:39:45.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
would I have to pay it
as much as I pay you?

1418
01:39:49.983 --> 01:39:50.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi.

1419
01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:54.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello.

1420
01:39:55.072 --> 01:39:56.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You disappeared.

1421
01:39:56.990 --> 01:40:00.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Yeah, I had to leave.

1422
01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:02.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't want to disturb.

1423
01:40:03.497 --> 01:40:04.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How have you been?

1424
01:40:05.374 --> 01:40:06.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine. Fine.

1425
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:08.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know, everything
much the same, you know.

1426
01:40:08.293 --> 01:40:10.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When they change the law,
Spike and I will marry immediately.

1427
01:40:12.715 --> 01:40:16.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whereas you, I've watched

1428
01:40:16.635 --> 01:40:20.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no, it's all nonsense,
believe me.

1429
01:40:20.931 --> 01:40:25.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd no idea how much
nonsense it was, but nonsense it all is.

1430
01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:32.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, yesterday was
our last day of filming,

1431
01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:35.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I'm leaving.

1432
01:40:37.573 --> 01:40:38.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But...

1433
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:46.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I brought this for you from home.
So I thought I'd give it to you.

1434
01:40:49.084 --> 01:40:50.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1435
01:40:53.046 --> 01:40:54.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Shall I...
-Oh, no, don't open it now,

1436
01:40:55.048 --> 01:40:56.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be embarrassed.

1437
01:40:58.969 --> 01:41:02.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, thank you. I don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

1438
01:41:02.848 --> 01:41:06.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I actually had it in my apartment.
I thought you...

1439
01:41:09.646 --> 01:41:11.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But when it came to it,

1440
01:41:11.356 --> 01:41:14.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't know how to call,
having behaved so badly.

1441
01:41:15.611 --> 01:41:16.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Twice.

1442
01:41:18.989 --> 01:41:22.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's just been
sitting in the hotel.

1443
01:41:23.368 --> 01:41:26.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then you came,
and I figured...

1444
01:41:31.335 --> 01:41:32.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The thing is...

1445
01:41:34.338 --> 01:41:35.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The thing is...

1446
01:41:38.592 --> 01:41:40.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? What is the thing?

1447
01:41:42.763 --> 01:41:46.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't even think about it.
Go away, immediately. Go away.

1448
01:41:46.183 --> 01:41:48.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. Sorry.

1449
01:41:52.856 --> 01:41:53.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You were saying?

1450
01:41:56.693 --> 01:41:57.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

1451
01:42:00.447 --> 01:42:04.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to go away today,
but I wondered if I didn't,

1452
01:42:06.662 --> 01:42:09.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
whether you might
let me see you a little,

1453
01:42:11.041 --> 01:42:13.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or a lot, maybe.

1454
01:42:17.297 --> 01:42:19.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See if you could
like me again.

1455
01:42:21.051 --> 01:42:23.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But yesterday that actor
asked you who I was

1456
01:42:23.178 --> 01:42:25.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you just dismissed
me out of hand.

1457
01:42:26.932 --> 01:42:27.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I heard.

1458
01:42:30.143 --> 01:42:33.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You had a microphone,
I had headphones.

1459
01:42:33.230 --> 01:42:35.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What, you expect me to tell
the truth about my life

1460
01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:37.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to the most indiscreet
man in England?

1461
01:42:40.654 --> 01:42:43.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Excuse me. It's your
mother on the phone.

1462
01:42:47.244 --> 01:42:49.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Will you tell her I'll
ring her back, please?

1463
01:42:49.621 --> 01:42:52.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've actually tried that tack,
but she said you've said that once before,

1464
01:42:52.583 --> 01:42:54.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's now been
about 24 hours

1465
01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:58.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the foot that was purple is now
sort of blackish in color and...

1466
01:42:58.130 --> 01:43:01.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, right, yeah.
Perfect timing as ever.

1467
01:43:03.927 --> 01:43:05.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Martin,
hold the fort a second.

1468
01:43:08.056 --> 01:43:09.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, all right.

1469
01:43:14.062 --> 01:43:15.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Martin stuttering]

1470
01:43:16.148 --> 01:43:21.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could I just say, I thought <i>Ghost</i> was
the most wonderful film.

1471
01:43:23.238 --> 01:43:24.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that right?

1472
01:43:24.656 --> 01:43:25.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yes.

1473
01:43:30.746 --> 01:43:36.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've always wondered what
Patrick Swayze's like in real life.

1474
01:43:37.252 --> 01:43:39.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't say that I know
Patrick all that well.

1475
01:43:39.922 --> 01:43:41.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What, he wasn't that
friendly during filming?

1476
01:43:42.466 --> 01:43:47.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I'm sure he was friendly to
Demi Moore who acted with him in <i>Ghost.</i>

1477
01:43:52.017 --> 01:43:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, right. Sorry.

1478
01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:57.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. Always been
a bit of an ass.

1479
01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway, well,
it was lovely to meet you.

1480
01:44:04.988 --> 01:44:10.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a huge fan of yours.
And Demi's of course.

1481
01:44:13.330 --> 01:44:14.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry about that.

1482
01:44:16.208 --> 01:44:17.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
