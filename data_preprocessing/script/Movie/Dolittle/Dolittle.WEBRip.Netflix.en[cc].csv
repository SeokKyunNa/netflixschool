00:00:54.929,00:00:58.516,known for his extraordinary ability.
00:01:03.271,00:01:06.232,Dr. Dolittle's reputation spread far and wide.
00:01:06.316,00:01:08.860,Even the Queen of England called on him.
00:01:09.569,00:01:16.534,"So grateful for his help, she gifted him a wondrous sanctuary whose doors were open to all creatures."
00:01:17.911,00:01:28.129,"His days belonged to the animals, but his heart belonged to one woman, Lily, the fearless explorer."
00:01:29.297,00:01:32.467,"They traveled the globe, going on great adventures."
00:01:32.550,00:01:36.513,Defending creatures who could not defend themselves.
00:01:42.310,00:01:45.230,They made an extraordinary team.
00:01:46.272,00:01:49.192,"Soon, that team became a family."
00:01:51.027,00:01:56.741,"With Lily by his side, Dolittle never felt more alive."
00:01:57.700,00:02:01.871,"Until one day, she left on an adventure."
00:02:09.170,00:02:11.714,Lily died at sea.
00:02:15.844,00:02:22.267,"Heartbroken, he locked the gates of the manor and completely retreated from the world."
00:02:22.350,00:02:31.234,"As for me, and the animals whose lives he'd saved, we were left to wonder, could anyone save his?"
00:02:35.446,00:02:41.161,"Until one morning, a most unlikely creature found its way into Dolittle's life."
00:02:41.244,00:02:43.621,A very special boy.
00:02:43.705,00:02:52.005,"In a time where people thought of animals only as possessions, food, or sport, this boy felt quite differently."
00:03:01.389,00:03:03.516,"This way, me scattered squirrel."
00:03:04.100,00:03:04.976,Right.
00:03:06.144,00:03:08.688,"Junior flushes them. You shoot them, yeah?"
00:03:11.524,00:03:12.567,Shoulder your gun.
00:03:20.450,00:03:21.910,"There, there they go. Shoot, shoot, shoot."
00:03:21.993,00:03:23.870,"You got him, you got him, you got him. Shoot, shoot, shoot."
00:03:30.001,00:03:32.211,You can't keep missing on purpose.
00:03:43.640,00:03:45.350,We have to help him.
00:03:47.101,00:03:48.686,We never leave an animal suffering.
00:03:48.770,00:03:50.355,Not on our error.
00:03:50.438,00:03:51.397,Here you go.
00:04:32.855,00:04:34.232,We treat all animals.
00:04:51.958,00:04:53.501,Secret entrance.
00:05:36.127,00:05:37.879,Poly? Where'd you go?
00:05:54.020,00:05:55.188,Good dog.
00:07:58.269,00:07:59.520,It's not good.
00:07:59.604,00:08:03.566,"As far as I'm concerned, I'm the only human here."
00:08:03.649,00:08:04.859,Just ignore them.
00:08:04.942,00:08:06.861,"There's no getting past a Kalahari snare, Doc."
00:08:06.944,00:08:08.029,It's an ingenious design.
00:08:08.112,00:08:09.947,I think you just caught yourself a boy.
00:08:10.031,00:08:11.616,Let me see. Wait. I don't wanna see.
00:08:13.075,00:08:15.203,"Deep breaths, Doc. Dab-Dab's got your back."
00:08:18.164,00:08:19.749,This is an opportunity.
00:08:28.591,00:08:30.384,Whatever are you doing up there?
00:08:31.719,00:08:34.931,I've come from Buckingham Palace on urgent business.
00:08:35.014,00:08:38.392,Can you tell me if this is the home of John Dolittle?
00:08:39.519,00:08:40.561,Who are you?
00:08:40.645,00:08:42.647,You may call me Lady Rose.
00:08:42.730,00:08:44.398,And you are?
00:08:44.982,00:08:46.150,Stubbins.
00:08:46.859,00:08:49.529,Could you help me down?
00:08:49.612,00:08:51.572,This goes against Dolittle's rules.
00:08:51.656,00:08:53.991,"Why are humans against the rules, again?"
00:08:54.075,00:08:57.828,"If you let humans too close, you'll get hurt more than you would if you didn't let them in at all."
00:08:57.912,00:08:59.038,"Isn't that right, Doc?"
00:08:59.121,00:09:01.666,"That's enough, everybody. Back to our routine."
00:09:03.334,00:09:05.461,Pull yourself together.
00:09:05.545,00:09:08.756,"You can't ignore people just because they're, eh, people."
00:09:10.758,00:09:11.968,Ooh.
00:09:12.885,00:09:14.595,"Possum, play dead."
00:09:17.139,00:09:18.891,"Chee-Chee, will you answer the door?"
00:09:18.975,00:09:20.309,You're the only one with arms.
00:09:25.439,00:09:28.109,Be brave and get rid of them.
00:09:28.192,00:09:29.652,And don't forget your mantra.
00:09:29.735,00:09:32.863,I am not a prisoner of fear?
00:09:32.947,00:09:35.449,You're not a prisoner of fear.
00:09:38.077,00:09:39.745,Have you been here before?
00:09:39.829,00:09:41.706,The queen's told me all about it.
00:09:41.789,00:09:43.916,It's a most unusual place.
00:09:44.000,00:09:45.585,I'm prepared for anything.
00:09:55.928,00:09:57.221,Wonderful.
00:09:57.305,00:09:59.223,A gorilla answering the door.
00:09:59.307,00:10:02.476,Just as the queen said.
00:10:07.940,00:10:10.735,Oh... Wait a minute...
00:10:10.818,00:10:12.862,I have an injured squirrel.
00:10:41.182,00:10:42.224,Hello?
00:11:03.079,00:11:04.914,"Oh, look at you."
00:11:04.997,00:11:08.709,"Aren't you peculiar, posing as a twig?"
00:11:17.551,00:11:18.552,Not here.
00:11:22.306,00:11:24.809,Yeah. Fine. Go on.
00:11:24.892,00:11:26.811,"-Dr. Dolittle? -Yeah, right."
00:11:26.894,00:11:31.190,You have been summoned to Buckingham Palace by the queen herself.
00:11:32.942,00:11:34.110,Go on.
00:11:34.193,00:11:37.780,"You should know, she's fallen gravely ill."
00:11:40.699,00:11:42.201,Do you understand what I'm saying?
00:11:42.284,00:11:44.829,Do you understand what I'm saying?
00:11:46.789,00:11:48.833,Go on and be gone!
00:11:53.045,00:11:55.423,The birds will show you out.
00:11:57.925,00:11:59.176,"Right, everything's tidy."
00:11:59.260,00:12:01.345,"Lunch will be served in a minute, now."
00:12:09.145,00:12:10.896,"Smells lovely, Doc."
00:12:18.696,00:12:21.031,"Sorry, Doc. Guess I'm scared of kids, too."
00:12:23.534,00:12:26.036,I'm going to be offering today a brothy soup.
00:12:28.622,00:12:30.875,"The queen has asked for you by name, sir."
00:12:30.958,00:12:31.959,Are you hard of hearing?
00:12:32.042,00:12:34.128,I told you I'm closed for business.
00:12:40.676,00:12:42.261,Treating humans.
00:12:50.144,00:12:51.729,Don't worry. I'm fine.
00:12:51.812,00:12:53.022,"Well, I'm not."
00:12:53.105,00:12:55.232,My house is descending into chaos.
00:12:55.316,00:12:56.859,Is he yours?
00:12:56.942,00:12:59.695,I don't own anybody.
00:12:59.778,00:13:02.072,Yoshi had an issue that he came to me with.
00:13:03.991,00:13:05.409,He's always cold.
00:13:06.869,00:13:08.579,I have an injured squirrel.
00:13:09.663,00:13:11.415,I don't know what to do.
00:13:11.999,00:13:13.209,How was he injured?
00:13:14.418,00:13:15.920,I...
00:13:16.003,00:13:17.463,I shot him.
00:13:17.546,00:13:19.215,What? I can't hear you.
00:13:19.298,00:13:21.509,I shot him. But it was an accident.
00:13:21.592,00:13:24.303,"Of course, an accidental firing-upon."
00:13:25.012,00:13:26.931,Humans never change.
00:13:27.014,00:13:28.599,He's very hurt.
00:13:30.017,00:13:32.186,Please help him.
00:13:40.945,00:13:42.780,Take that...
00:13:42.863,00:13:44.615,and this.
00:13:52.039,00:13:54.083,I... I...
00:13:54.833,00:13:56.794,I'm too beautiful to die.
00:14:14.228,00:14:15.312,Yes?
00:14:16.146,00:14:18.107,He's with us.
00:14:19.942,00:14:22.194,"Light the lamps, disinfect the surgery."
00:14:22.278,00:14:23.863,You will not tend to a squirrel...
00:14:23.946,00:14:26.073,while the Queen of England's life hangs in the balance.
00:14:26.156,00:14:28.450,"Oh, you don't know me very well, do you?"
00:14:28.534,00:14:29.869,Don't drop him.
00:14:29.952,00:14:30.911,We got a code red.
00:14:30.995,00:14:32.788,"Code red, code red, everybody!"
00:14:39.295,00:14:41.213,Whew! I haven't done this in a while.
00:14:41.297,00:14:43.424,Let's get everything the way Doc likes it.
00:15:01.942,00:15:03.611,"If I die, I swear I will haunt your house."
00:15:10.117,00:15:13.537,"They're understanding him, and he's understanding them..."
00:15:13.621,00:15:15.039,in their own languages.
00:15:22.922,00:15:24.256,Wow.
00:15:26.467,00:15:27.635,Here you go.
00:15:27.718,00:15:29.762,"That's a piece of celery. Forceps, Dab-Dab."
00:15:29.845,00:15:31.639,"Oh, sorry. Here you go."
00:15:31.722,00:15:33.057,Still celery.
00:15:33.140,00:15:34.099,Forcep?
00:15:34.183,00:15:35.809,"-Carrot, that is. -Forcep?"
00:15:35.893,00:15:37.436,That's a different piece of celery.
00:15:37.519,00:15:38.437,Got it. Forcep.
00:15:38.520,00:15:41.065,"No, still celery. Never mind, I'll get it myself."
00:15:43.150,00:15:45.569,I wanna know how to talk to the animals.
00:15:49.156,00:15:51.116,"My brow as well, when you've got a second."
00:15:51.200,00:15:52.660,Right. Sorry.
00:15:52.743,00:15:56.288,I'm going to come here and be Dolittle's apprentice.
00:15:56.372,00:15:59.500,Her Majesty has designated this land a nature preserve.
00:16:00.793,00:16:06.966,"If she dies, the deed will be owned by the Treasury, and this place goes away."
00:16:08.175,00:16:09.718,-Shut down? -Mm-hmm.
00:16:18.644,00:16:20.562,That's the spot.
00:16:20.646,00:16:22.523,"Keep an eye on Kevin, shall we?"
00:16:22.606,00:16:25.234,He may be prickly when the anesthetic wears off.
00:16:30.823,00:16:32.533,Revenge.
00:16:36.495,00:16:39.248,You need to go and help the queen.
00:16:40.040,00:16:43.127,There are things I no longer do.
00:16:43.210,00:16:45.045,"Work with humans, or leave the house."
00:16:45.129,00:16:47.089,"Or bathe. Oh, exercise."
00:16:47.172,00:16:51.677,Express emotional vulnerability.
00:16:51.760,00:16:53.303,"Wake up, John."
00:16:53.387,00:16:57.725,"If the queen dies, the Treasury takes the deed, and we lose this house."
00:16:57.808,00:17:00.310,"You're talking out of your tail feathers, Poly."
00:17:01.228,00:17:03.147,The deed was for life.
00:17:03.230,00:17:05.774,"The last time I checked, I was very much alive."
00:17:05.858,00:17:07.943,"The queen's life, John. Not yours."
00:17:12.823,00:17:16.076,I knew I shouldn't have let monkeys proofread the contract.
00:17:16.160,00:17:18.996,"Elliot, Elsie, you are fired!"
00:17:20.164,00:17:21.707,It gets worse.
00:17:21.790,00:17:25.335,We'll be thrown out of these gates right in the middle of hunting season!
00:17:26.670,00:17:28.005,"Breathe, Chee-Chee."
00:17:28.088,00:17:29.798,We get kicked out if the queen dies?
00:17:29.882,00:17:30.758,We're gonna be hunted!
00:17:30.841,00:17:31.842,"Everybody, calm down."
00:17:33.510,00:17:35.262,Look at the state of him now. Hmm!
00:17:35.345,00:17:38.599,"Fear not, I have an in at, uh, Regent's Park Zoo."
00:17:38.682,00:17:40.601,"Everyone, pack your bags!"
00:17:42.352,00:17:43.645,Uh-uh.
00:17:43.729,00:17:47.191,"You help the queen, or we are leaving."
00:17:47.274,00:17:48.567,You're bluffing.
00:17:48.650,00:17:50.736,Don't make me count.
00:17:50.819,00:17:52.529,Don't make me count.
00:17:52.613,00:17:53.947,One...
00:17:54.031,00:17:55.074,Three!
00:17:55.157,00:17:56.366,...two...
00:17:57.201,00:17:59.578,All right! I'll do it.
00:18:01.622,00:18:03.457,"Right, let's get you ready to go, honey."
00:18:12.382,00:18:13.759,This isn't gonna hurt a bit.
00:18:18.972,00:18:20.766,Arthur? How long have you been living in there?
00:18:20.849,00:18:22.726,I don't know. What year is it?
00:18:27.481,00:18:29.525,"Nighty-night, Doc."
00:18:40.160,00:18:40.994,Look.
00:18:45.040,00:18:46.166,How is he?
00:18:50.629,00:18:51.713,Expect a full recovery.
00:18:51.797,00:18:53.674,"And after some violent grooming, it's been decided."
00:18:55.092,00:18:57.970,"We will accompany you to Buckingham Palace, after all."
00:18:59.513,00:19:03.809,Hmm. You are going back to whatever burrow you emerged from.
00:19:04.893,00:19:08.063,Try not to shoot anything on your way home.
00:19:17.906,00:19:20.284,Maybe I should stay here. I don't do well in crowds.
00:19:22.077,00:19:24.538,"But we all go together, just like the old days."
00:19:24.621,00:19:26.290,"Ooh, don't forget Doc's forceps."
00:19:26.373,00:19:27.833,"That's a leek, Dab-Dab."
00:19:31.086,00:19:32.296,No.
00:19:32.379,00:19:33.463,Where are you? Oh.
00:19:34.381,00:19:36.049,"So, would you care to come along?"
00:19:39.219,00:19:40.304,I know.
00:19:40.387,00:19:42.514,"I had other plans, as well."
00:19:45.934,00:19:47.060,Shh.
00:20:13.962,00:20:15.756,"Ah, today's gonna be a good day."
00:20:15.839,00:20:19.593,"I'm gonna do nothing. Just prance around, think my own thoughts, and... Oh."
00:20:19.676,00:20:21.261,"He's walking this way, not a great sign."
00:20:21.345,00:20:22.804,He's got no beard. He looks motivated.
00:20:24.765,00:20:26.683,People only say that when they're about to be alarming.
00:20:26.767,00:20:28.352,"-Look, I know it's been a while. -Sorry about this."
00:20:28.435,00:20:30.229,And sorry about that!
00:20:31.396,00:20:32.689,I'm unavailable. Ahh!
00:20:32.773,00:20:34.733,Unavailable for the man who changed your life?
00:20:34.816,00:20:36.526,"We're going to save the queen, bro!"
00:20:36.610,00:20:37.778,I am not your bro.
00:20:37.861,00:20:39.655,You should be an Eskimo's rug by now.
00:20:39.738,00:20:41.073,-Ow. Claws! -Ow. Beak!
00:20:41.156,00:20:42.199,-Claws. -Beak.
00:20:47.454,00:20:50.791,"Why are you riding me? There's, like, four horses in front of us."
00:21:01.927,00:21:03.845,We've hit the big time!
00:21:22.114,00:21:24.283,Guards! Guards!
00:21:31.081,00:21:33.333,They are the queen's own guests.
00:21:33.417,00:21:35.252,Treat them accordingly.
00:21:37.045,00:21:38.130,"Make way, boys!"
00:21:38.755,00:21:39.923,Plimpton!
00:21:40.007,00:21:41.049,Don't! Stop!
00:21:49.182,00:21:50.267,Ahh! Can't see!
00:21:56.356,00:21:57.357,Okay.
00:21:58.275,00:22:00.152,I blame the hat.
00:22:13.081,00:22:14.291,Lord Badgley.
00:22:15.542,00:22:17.544,I come from the House of Lords.
00:22:18.128,00:22:21.006,There is great concern for Her Majesty's health.
00:22:23.133,00:22:29.765,I shall continue to leech to circulate the vapors in the bloodstream.
00:22:29.848,00:22:32.642,She'll be lucky to last the week.
00:22:36.563,00:22:38.732,This is not the first time Dr. Dolittle's been here.
00:22:38.815,00:22:41.318,You got a dying queen? Not for long.
00:22:41.401,00:22:42.944,Dr. Dolittle is in the...
00:22:45.489,00:22:47.491,"Oh, oh. Wait! Wait for me!"
00:22:47.574,00:22:50.368,"A stowaway, my lady who claims to be..."
00:22:50.452,00:22:51.995,Dr. Dolittle's apprentice!
00:22:52.079,00:22:53.663,"It's quite all right, Gareth."
00:22:57.501,00:23:00.796,he should fetch my bags and keep his gob shut.
00:23:05.717,00:23:07.094,What on Earth?
00:23:09.763,00:23:11.765,I demand their immediate removal.
00:23:11.848,00:23:14.810,"Ah, Lady Rose. My apologies. Please forgive me."
00:23:14.893,00:23:17.187,I didn't realize that you were part of...
00:23:17.270,00:23:18.396,John Dolittle?
00:23:21.358,00:23:22.400,Poopfling?
00:23:23.819,00:23:26.446,"-No, it's Müdfly. -Müdfly."
00:23:26.530,00:23:27.697,-With an umlaut. -Yes.
00:23:27.781,00:23:29.783,-From the German. -Of course. From the Germans.
00:23:29.866,00:23:30.992,Why is he here?
00:23:31.076,00:23:33.620,Her Majesty has personally requested Dr. Dolittle.
00:23:48.051,00:23:50.220,"All right, Jip, give her a good sniff."
00:23:59.146,00:24:00.397,This is outrageous.
00:24:09.656,00:24:10.991,"You all right, fellow?"
00:24:11.074,00:24:12.450,Something smelled wrong.
00:24:12.534,00:24:14.911,And that's coming from a guy who loves the smell of butts.
00:24:16.329,00:24:18.206,I detected a whiff of something else.
00:24:18.290,00:24:19.499,"Floral, with earthy..."
00:24:22.627,00:24:25.881,"I'm perplexed, Doc. I've never smelled anything like it before."
00:24:26.590,00:24:30.886,"Uh, clearly, Jipsy and I are out of our depths. May we consult?"
00:24:31.511,00:24:33.680,"Well, of course. I'd be more than happy to help illuminate..."
00:24:48.278,00:24:50.197,Did you see anything unusual?
00:24:50.280,00:24:51.698,"Snitches get glitches, man."
00:24:55.702,00:24:59.623,John and I were students at Edinburgh years ago.
00:24:59.706,00:25:03.043,Some thought he had a gift for observation.
00:25:03.960,00:25:05.003,Leona...
00:25:06.004,00:25:09.883,"Okay, she drank tea and then fell down."
00:25:16.723,00:25:17.891,Ugh.
00:25:17.974,00:25:19.684,"Oh. Sorry about that, Mini."
00:25:23.188,00:25:24.189,Stay here.
00:25:24.272,00:25:26.107,"Dab-Dab, clear out the humans."
00:25:26.191,00:25:28.818,"Boyo, fetch the Botanical Index and the tea tin."
00:25:28.902,00:25:30.195,Everyone out!
00:25:30.278,00:25:32.322,Do you understand the words coming out of my bill?
00:25:41.873,00:25:43.416,Negative.
00:25:45.710,00:25:46.586,Negative.
00:25:49.464,00:25:50.632,"Aye, aye."
00:25:58.932,00:26:00.600,"What have you found, Dolittle?"
00:26:00.684,00:26:02.978,"Well, quite possibly the answer to everything."
00:26:03.061,00:26:04.062,Exposure to toxins...
00:26:05.772,00:26:08.984,"Lean in, lean in, I'm saying something interesting."
00:26:09.067,00:26:10.735,I am interested.
00:26:10.819,00:26:14.864,The queen's symptoms are due to the effect of a rare Sumatran plant...
00:26:14.948,00:26:17.742,known as the Nightshade flower.
00:26:17.826,00:26:22.289,A solar eclipse will occur on the 17th of this very month.
00:26:22.372,00:26:26.418,"If she has not received the antidote by then, she will perish."
00:26:27.836,00:26:29.587,Is that a Turner?
00:26:29.671,00:26:31.881,Must be. What a fine painting.
00:26:31.965,00:26:33.758,"I say, Dolittle, what is your plan?"
00:26:36.678,00:26:38.471,I suppose we do need one.
00:26:38.555,00:26:46.104,"Well, the queen's only hope is a cure that's never been tested from a tree that's never been seen, on an island that's never been found."
00:26:46.187,00:26:57.198,"Sounds ridiculous, saying it out loud. But regardless of that, we have no choice but to embark on this perilous journey to obtain the fruit of the Eden Tree."
00:26:59.951,00:27:01.828,"Oh, my. Fantastic."
00:27:02.537,00:27:05.665,The Dolittle's with their Eden Tree Island.
00:27:05.749,00:27:08.084,"Isn't it enough that your wife-- Shut up, Blair!"
00:27:08.168,00:27:11.838,"Sorry, I meant to say, Lovely to see you again, Blair."
00:27:12.339,00:27:13.757,We're off now.
00:27:13.840,00:27:14.924,Ta-ra.
00:27:15.008,00:27:17.886,"Oh, its fruit is said to cure every malady known to man."
00:27:19.846,00:27:22.140,even restore the hair on your head.
00:27:22.223,00:27:26.269,You must let nothing pass her lips that hasn't been made and served by you.
00:27:26.353,00:27:27.228,Clear?
00:27:29.522,00:27:30.982,That's us to the carriage.
00:27:31.066,00:27:33.318,"Jip, you need to stay behind and guard the queen."
00:27:33.401,00:27:34.402,Very important.
00:27:34.486,00:27:36.112,"Right, guard dog mode."
00:27:36.196,00:27:38.907,"Stand back, everyone, while I secure the perimeter."
00:27:41.743,00:27:42.952,Excuse me.
00:27:46.998,00:27:49.667,I do so admire how you don't give up.
00:27:49.751,00:27:52.087,The queen is counting on both of you.
00:27:52.170,00:27:53.713,Good luck.
00:27:58.551,00:28:02.639,"We got a long voyage in front of us, and the boat isn't gonna sail itself."
00:28:08.144,00:28:09.479,Seems like she's full up.
00:28:11.981,00:28:13.400,Plenty of room.
00:28:13.483,00:28:14.818,"Oh, no."
00:28:15.902,00:28:18.279,"I mean, one more stop, good fellow."
00:28:20.949,00:28:23.827,"Well, I believe it's time to go our separate ways."
00:28:23.910,00:28:25.578,"Uh, I'm going with you."
00:28:25.662,00:28:27.038,Certainly not.
00:28:27.122,00:28:28.081,It's far too treacherous.
00:28:28.164,00:28:29.457,I'm your apprentice.
00:28:29.541,00:28:30.750,"You? No, no, no."
00:28:32.293,00:28:33.837,You don't need an apprentice and an ostrich.
00:28:33.920,00:28:35.130,I'll go home.
00:28:35.213,00:28:37.715,"I didn't want to be embarrassed, so I pretended you belonged."
00:28:37.799,00:28:39.592,"I was helpful in there, wasn't I?"
00:28:39.676,00:28:41.678,-Hmm. -The animals like me.
00:28:41.761,00:28:43.513,I don't take up much space.
00:28:44.222,00:28:45.974,I think I belong here.
00:28:47.183,00:28:48.935,Don't make me go home.
00:28:49.728,00:28:51.062,Please.
00:29:02.741,00:29:05.326,What is that around your neck? Come on.
00:29:05.410,00:29:07.203,"I'm worried about the boy, Bethan."
00:29:07.287,00:29:09.080,Give him time. Time is all.
00:29:09.164,00:29:12.459,"We're hunters, Bethan. Hunters!"
00:29:12.542,00:29:13.877,It has a certain...
00:29:13.960,00:29:16.713,We hunt things. He frees things.
00:29:16.796,00:29:18.214,The rabbits and mice.
00:29:18.298,00:29:20.884,He carries spiders outside.
00:29:20.967,00:29:23.136,Nobody likes spiders. Not even spiders.
00:29:24.596,00:29:26.973,I don't know how your sister put up with him.
00:29:53.666,00:29:54.793,What are you doing here?
00:29:54.876,00:29:56.878,Making sure you don't miss the boat.
00:29:58.004,00:29:59.923,Am I talking to an animal?
00:30:00.715,00:30:02.383,"-Just like Dolittle? -Oh, no."
00:30:02.467,00:30:05.637,"I'm speaking human, better than any parrot ever has actually."
00:30:07.222,00:30:09.516,"Now, let's pack some clothes. Come on."
00:30:14.813,00:30:17.273,But Dolittle said I belong here.
00:30:17.357,00:30:19.067,"Little help, Tutu?"
00:30:20.652,00:30:22.821,"Well, I never heard him say anything of the sort."
00:30:23.905,00:30:26.741,"There's something special about you, Stubbins."
00:30:26.825,00:30:30.328,Something I've only seen in two other humans.
00:30:30.411,00:30:33.081,"You belong with us, kid."
00:30:33.164,00:30:36.042,And you let me worry about Dolittle. That's my job.
00:30:36.125,00:30:40.672,"So, are you ready for the adventure of a lifetime?"
00:30:45.844,00:30:46.803,I'm in.
00:30:46.886,00:30:48.429,"Of course, you are."
00:30:48.513,00:30:49.764,"Poly, let's move."
00:30:49.848,00:30:51.975,"We got a boat to catch, and we're burning daylight."
00:30:52.058,00:30:55.353,"Fret not, ma chérie. We have the perfect plan."
00:30:59.691,00:31:01.234,Don't let them get away!
00:31:01.818,00:31:04.988,Why are they chasing us? We're not criminals.
00:31:05.071,00:31:06.447,Speak for yourself!
00:31:06.531,00:31:08.283,We're wanted in three forests!
00:31:08.366,00:31:11.202,And it's not an escape mission unless you're being chased.
00:31:15.623,00:31:16.875,"Which way, Tutu?"
00:31:35.101,00:31:38.104,Whew! We've done it! We've done it! We've...
00:31:38.187,00:31:39.731,...missed it.
00:31:41.399,00:31:42.358,what's our next move?
00:31:42.442,00:31:44.903,We cut our losses. Change our identities.
00:31:44.986,00:31:46.112,Ditch the kid in the river.
00:31:46.195,00:31:47.697,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy."
00:31:47.780,00:31:48.948,What about that bridge?
00:31:51.200,00:31:53.036,"Uh, that was my next suggestion."
00:31:53.119,00:31:54.203,Let's go!
00:31:59.042,00:32:01.377,Your seasickness will wear off.
00:32:03.588,00:32:05.423,You'll get your sea legs back. You look terrible.
00:32:05.506,00:32:07.175,"Ah, button it!"
00:32:07.258,00:32:08.885,Who put me in this hammock?
00:32:08.968,00:32:11.554,"I am the captain of this ship, right?"
00:32:11.638,00:32:14.432,"Raise the blasted sails, will you?"
00:32:15.558,00:32:17.727,"Uh, that's a big bite."
00:32:19.812,00:32:21.105,"Everyone, look!"
00:32:21.189,00:32:22.690,Is that the boy?
00:32:22.774,00:32:24.275,He's coming to finish the job!
00:32:24.359,00:32:26.110,He won't rest till I'm dead!
00:32:26.194,00:32:27.445,He's obsessed!
00:32:30.156,00:32:31.407,"No, I want to go faster."
00:32:32.867,00:32:34.285,We're going to miss all the good current!
00:32:34.369,00:32:37.080,"-I hope you make it. -Me, too, Dabs!"
00:32:43.878,00:32:46.089,Whoa. Big hole! 12 o'clock!
00:32:46.172,00:32:47.590,Maybe this was a bad idea.
00:32:50.301,00:32:53.096,"-Let's go, Stubbins, let's go. -Come on, kid. Get on the boat!"
00:33:24.711,00:33:27.296,"No! Oh, no!"
00:33:28.965,00:33:30.049,"Jump, murderer!"
00:33:30.133,00:33:31.634,You got this.
00:33:43.730,00:33:45.648,"No, no, no!"
00:33:53.740,00:33:55.074,"Crushed it, kid."
00:33:56.993,00:33:58.995,Why y'all cheering for the kid who shot me?
00:34:03.624,00:34:04.917,"Can I have a word, please?"
00:34:09.464,00:34:12.175,What is she thinking? The boy nearly killed himself.
00:34:15.344,00:34:17.889,And I'm its sovereign. And there are consequences...
00:34:17.972,00:34:20.099,...to ignoring me. Is that what you were going to say?
00:34:20.183,00:34:22.268,"No, no. Don't mince my words."
00:34:22.351,00:34:24.187,And stop messing with my routine.
00:34:24.270,00:34:26.564,Look at the state of you. You're sick as a dog.
00:34:26.647,00:34:28.691,"Actually, I have my medicine."
00:34:28.775,00:34:31.486,See? This licorice root is working a treat.
00:34:32.111,00:34:34.113,"Sit down, John."
00:34:36.282,00:34:38.201,Don't embarrass me in front of the crew.
00:34:38.284,00:34:40.661,I'm sparing you embarrassment.
00:34:40.745,00:34:42.205,You need a trim.
00:34:42.288,00:34:44.123,"All right, all right, be quick."
00:34:44.207,00:34:46.542,"It's important to maintain my status, yeah?"
00:34:46.626,00:34:48.961,"This ship is dangerous, no place for a... Ow."
00:34:51.172,00:34:52.673,Private conversation!
00:34:55.927,00:34:59.222,"I know this particular voyage is hard for you, John."
00:34:59.305,00:35:01.057,"It is for me, too."
00:35:01.140,00:35:06.687,"I brought you, Lily, just when you needed her, and now you need one of your own kind again."
00:35:06.771,00:35:09.190,Someone without feathers or fur.
00:35:10.399,00:35:12.819,"Fine, the boy can stay, but it will be on my terms."
00:35:12.902,00:35:14.320,And I'll keep him quite busy.
00:35:14.403,00:35:16.781,You'll do it with a smile on your face.
00:35:18.491,00:35:19.784,Crew!
00:35:20.326,00:35:22.370,Seems you got a new shipmate.
00:35:26.499,00:35:30.586,"As I just told Poly, we are a bit shorthanded after all, so..."
00:35:30.670,00:35:31.963,You won't regret it.
00:35:32.046,00:35:33.214,Welcome aboard!
00:35:33.297,00:35:36.717,I hear you could be a big help by cleaning this up.
00:35:36.801,00:35:38.636,"That, too, if you wouldn't mind."
00:35:38.719,00:35:39.762,Oops! Those as well.
00:35:43.391,00:35:45.560,Careful with that medical equipment!
00:35:53.359,00:35:56.779,He's absolutely thrilled to have you.
00:36:09.000,00:36:10.251,Hmm.
00:36:11.460,00:36:13.004,"Hello there, little squid."
00:36:13.087,00:36:15.298,"You don't understand me, do you?"
00:36:15.381,00:36:17.341,That would be preposterous.
00:36:17.425,00:36:19.844,-Müdfly-- -I wasn't talking to the squid!
00:36:20.428,00:36:26.767,"I'm dispatching a frigate, the Britannia, to follow Dolittle."
00:36:26.851,00:36:30.730,"But you must not support him in his foolishness, my lord."
00:36:35.526,00:36:40.406,England has enemies everywhere waiting for the slightest sign of weakness.
00:36:41.490,00:36:44.744,Entrusting beloved Britain to a child queen...
00:36:44.827,00:36:46.621,That is lunacy.
00:36:46.704,00:36:58.591,"So, while I remain here, ensuring no one prevents me from taking the throne, you will be on the Britannia, making certain Dolittle never returns."
00:37:13.648,00:37:16.108,"You got me on the ropes, you have, Cheech."
00:37:16.192,00:37:17.276,Come on. One-two.
00:37:17.360,00:37:18.694,"Jab, jab cross."
00:37:19.737,00:37:20.988,The best form of defense is attack.
00:37:38.839,00:37:41.133,I really don't wanna fight you.
00:37:42.677,00:37:44.011,It's a therapeutic session.
00:37:57.149,00:37:58.567,I'm actually starting to understand.
00:38:34.353,00:38:37.273,Every step is planned out in my journal.
00:38:38.149,00:38:40.901,I'll be back before you even miss me.
00:38:56.459,00:39:00.296,I think I'm beginning to understand a little bit of what the animals are saying.
00:39:13.309,00:39:14.894,"Well, what kind of a bird..."
00:39:14.977,00:39:17.730,"-Wait, are you even a bird? -Of course, I am."
00:39:17.813,00:39:19.523,"-Well, can you fly? -No."
00:39:19.607,00:39:21.108,-Can you swim? -No.
00:39:21.192,00:39:23.110,"-Well, what can you do? -I can run."
00:39:23.194,00:39:25.571,I can run. What bird stuff can you do?
00:39:25.654,00:39:27.490,"Well, what bear stuff can you do?"
00:39:30.242,00:39:31.577,You win this round.
00:39:43.839,00:39:46.842,Ro... Roar!
00:39:49.095,00:39:51.514,"Oh, you were saying warship!"
00:39:52.681,00:39:54.517,Weird time to be asking for pickles.
00:39:54.600,00:39:56.852,"I mean, who could eat when we're under attack?"
00:39:56.936,00:39:58.896,Enemy! Starboard aft.
00:39:58.979,00:40:01.899,"Elliot, you and Elsie ready the machine."
00:40:01.982,00:40:03.526,We're gonna need speed.
00:40:03.609,00:40:05.736,Send out the call!
00:40:14.995,00:40:17.915,"Stubbins, boy, I need you now more than ever."
00:40:17.998,00:40:19.041,To stand still.
00:40:22.628,00:40:25.840,"Oh, hello, Blair, you chinless wonder."
00:40:27.133,00:40:30.302,"He said something about my chin, didn't he?"
00:40:30.886,00:40:32.555,"It's a magnificent chin, sir."
00:40:32.638,00:40:35.558,We're in their sights. Cannons are taking aim.
00:40:35.641,00:40:37.643,Let's turn this ship!
00:40:42.398,00:40:45.693,It is time for me to slip into something less comfortable.
00:40:56.370,00:40:58.539,I bought a front-row seat to crazy town.
00:41:01.667,00:41:05.045,"Once Humphrey's been secured, you pull me out on Yoshi's signal."
00:41:05.129,00:41:07.715,"Me? I can't handle that type of pressure, Doc."
00:41:07.798,00:41:10.301,I'm a cheer-quietly-from- the-sidelines kind of gorilla.
00:41:10.384,00:41:14.513,"Don't worry, Cheech. You'll rise to the occasion. Huh?"
00:41:14.597,00:41:17.308,You're stronger than you know.
00:41:17.391,00:41:26.859,"Now, remember, I need the second part!"
00:41:26.942,00:41:29.195,"-No time, Cheech. Let's go. -Oh."
00:41:40.623,00:41:43.792,"Look, look, they're already abandoning ship."
00:41:44.376,00:41:45.377,Boom!
00:41:51.383,00:41:52.801,"Oh, this is gonna be cold."
00:41:52.885,00:41:54.553,But I'm coming in hot!
00:42:04.188,00:42:05.731,Let's hook it up!
00:42:13.739,00:42:15.074,Where we headed?
00:42:20.913,00:42:23.082,"Okay, I can do this. I can do this."
00:42:32.466,00:42:33.634,Are they pulling away?
00:42:37.429,00:42:38.639,It's working!
00:42:38.722,00:42:39.682,How is this possible?
00:42:39.765,00:42:44.019,"Well, sir, it appears Dolittle and a polar bear have harnessed a whale-- It was a rhetorical question!"
00:42:44.937,00:42:45.854,Just fire!
00:43:02.246,00:43:04.373,I failed. I knew I couldn't do it.
00:43:17.469,00:43:19.888,"Hang on. I'm coming, kid!"
00:43:42.828,00:43:44.413,"Oh, no."
00:43:44.496,00:43:45.623,"Oh, no."
00:44:09.772,00:44:11.315,"I let you down, Doc."
00:44:11.899,00:44:15.069,"Look at me, I'm fine. We're all fine."
00:44:17.571,00:44:19.448,It's okay to be scared.
00:44:24.870,00:44:27.039,"You saved me, did you? Fair play."
00:44:27.122,00:44:28.666,Thanks very much.
00:44:29.792,00:44:31.627,"Well done, everybody."
00:44:33.003,00:44:35.381,"Feel like you belong now, kid?"
00:44:51.855,00:44:53.107,"They've gotten away, sir."
00:44:53.190,00:44:55.234,"Oh, really? I thought they disappeared into thin air."
00:44:55.317,00:44:57.069,"I'm afraid not, sir. They've escaped."
00:44:57.152,00:44:58.821,"Read the room, Lieutenant."
00:44:58.904,00:45:00.322,I can see they've escaped.
00:45:01.323,00:45:02.950,But not for long.
00:45:06.829,00:45:09.331,That must mean I am the Chosen One.
00:45:14.044,00:45:18.549,"Dolittle had to write a paper about it, which of course nobody took seriously."
00:45:18.632,00:45:21.718,This one even theorizes the existence of dragons.
00:45:26.932,00:45:27.891,What obsession?
00:45:27.975,00:45:29.309,I'm not obsessed with Dolittle.
00:45:29.393,00:45:30.519,You're obsessed with Dolittle.
00:45:30.602,00:45:32.938,You're the one obsessing about my obsession with...
00:45:35.232,00:45:40.612,"I'm loath to admit it, but he's more valuable alive, for now."
00:45:41.196,00:45:45.576,"But, luckily, I think I know where he's going."
00:45:48.954,00:45:52.082,"Kevin's log, day seven. I'm now totally isolated."
00:45:52.166,00:46:00.174,The enemy has ingratiated himself No sign of promised tropical island or the magic fruit.
00:46:00.257,00:46:02.009,But I will endure.
00:46:19.109,00:46:20.152,"-Really? -Yeah, yeah."
00:46:20.235,00:46:22.196,I have to calculate our route coordinates.
00:46:22.279,00:46:24.448,The bees are buzzing about you.
00:46:24.531,00:46:27.701,Seems you are getting a rudimentary grasp of their language.
00:46:28.619,00:46:30.120,Thirty-five degrees portside.
00:46:32.206,00:46:33.373,Well...
00:46:33.457,00:46:42.424,"I have noticed when they fly in a zig-zag pattern, Which means, Back off, kid."
00:46:48.263,00:46:50.015,"That means, Look at this."
00:46:50.098,00:46:51.934,Mm. Look at me.
00:46:52.017,00:46:53.644,"-Oh, close. -Not bad, though."
00:46:53.727,00:46:56.021,"Oh. No, when Chee-Chee says..."
00:46:57.481,00:46:58.857,When Chee-Chee says...
00:47:02.694,00:47:05.697,"That means, Where's my blanket?"
00:47:06.865,00:47:07.908,Very good.
00:47:12.037,00:47:14.122,Is that the map of Eden Tree Island?
00:47:14.748,00:47:18.043,The Eden Tree cannot be found on any map.
00:47:18.126,00:47:23.465,"And to call it an island is to suggest that it is of our world, and it is anything but."
00:47:24.132,00:47:30.389,"That is why we must first go to Monteverde, birthplace of the only person to ever chart a course to the tree."
00:47:30.472,00:47:33.850,Her name was Lily. She wrote the route in a journal.
00:47:33.934,00:47:36.061,"But on her voyage, she was shipwrecked."
00:47:37.062,00:47:40.107,The world lost the greatest explorer I've ever known.
00:47:42.734,00:47:52.119,"The journal from that expedition Elliot, Elsie, do you mind?"
00:47:55.414,00:47:57.124,"So, anyway, you get the picture."
00:47:57.207,00:48:01.878,"To have any chance of finding the tree, we have to go to Monteverde and steal that flipping journal."
00:48:03.797,00:48:05.007,Did I say that?
00:48:05.090,00:48:06.842,"Well, what's the worst that can happen?"
00:48:11.096,00:48:14.975,"Don't worry, I know an omen when I see one, and that was not an omen."
00:48:18.103,00:48:20.105,Stealing the journal is not a big deal!
00:48:22.816,00:48:27.029,"In fact, Monteverde itself is not a big deal."
00:48:33.118,00:48:39.750,"After all, this island of bandits and thieves was once a place Dolittle, Lily, and I called home."
00:48:43.086,00:48:47.174,"of the island's notorious ruler, King Rassouli."
00:48:47.257,00:48:53.388,"And just our luck, his most prized possession was the very journal we needed to steal."
00:48:54.806,00:48:56.850,"So, Dolittle needed a disguise."
00:49:02.648,00:49:09.613,"While I was left watching over the rest of the crew, Dolittle and Stubbins snuck into the palace."
00:49:14.743,00:49:15.911,I'm about to die!
00:49:23.585,00:49:29.758,But Dolittle still had questionable contacts on the island.
00:49:32.177,00:49:35.555,The opening bid will suffice. You have my attention.
00:49:35.639,00:49:39.518,Don Carpenterino. I'm here on behalf of these humans.
00:49:39.601,00:49:43.355,They will pay you handsomely for your family's lock-picking skills.
00:49:43.438,00:49:47.484,"You come to me for this, on the day of my daughter's wedding?"
00:49:47.567,00:49:49.528,Wait a minute. Which daughter?
00:49:49.611,00:49:51.863,It's not... Sheila?
00:49:51.947,00:49:54.658,My Sheila? She's getting married?
00:49:54.741,00:49:56.368,To a scorpion named Dylan.
00:49:56.451,00:49:59.579,"Sorry, Boy Scout. I guess Sheila's into bad boys now."
00:50:01.998,00:50:04.126,We were gonna spend the rest of our life spans together.
00:50:05.711,00:50:08.004,What's your human's best offer?
00:50:08.088,00:50:11.466,"Two more now, and two later. Huh?"
00:50:11.550,00:50:13.885,Okay. You have yourself a deal.
00:50:16.304,00:50:18.056,"Guys, I'm no Boy Scout."
00:50:18.140,00:50:21.893,"Also, what's a scorpion got that I don't got?"
00:50:21.977,00:50:37.659,Besides a massive stinger-- Totally messing up my plan.
00:50:38.243,00:50:39.077,I can fit through them.
00:50:39.161,00:50:40.787,"No, no, no. It's too dangerous, man."
00:50:41.705,00:50:43.999,Can't go in there on your own.
00:50:45.959,00:50:48.295,I need something to distract me from this Sheila reveal.
00:50:48.378,00:50:50.922,"Are you sure your head's in the right place, James?"
00:50:51.006,00:50:54.718,"Oh, yeah. I'll get the kid in, and then fly headfirst into a brick."
00:50:56.636,00:50:58.847,Aye. All right.
00:50:58.930,00:51:00.265,James will look after you. It's fine.
00:51:00.891,00:51:03.769,Listen closely. Get the journal and get out of there.
00:51:03.852,00:51:06.188,Go through the room quietly. Look for the tiger's eye.
00:51:06.271,00:51:08.190,Go down the hidden staircase.
00:51:08.273,00:51:10.817,"And most importantly, keep your disguise on."
00:51:14.029,00:51:16.323,Rassouli loves his cats.
00:51:22.287,00:51:24.206,'cause we can just fly right over the...
00:51:24.289,00:51:25.248,Wait.
00:51:25.332,00:51:28.210,"Uh, I see the mistake I made here. You can't fly."
00:51:36.301,00:51:37.260,Hey! Oh! Watch out!
00:51:37.344,00:51:38.470,Kitty cat on your six.
00:51:42.432,00:51:43.391,Hey!
00:51:44.309,00:51:45.602,"Slick move, kid."
00:51:47.395,00:51:49.272,We make a pretty good team.
00:51:49.356,00:51:51.608,A real couple of bad boys.
00:52:17.592,00:52:19.719,I'll keep watch on these lions.
00:52:19.803,00:52:22.264,That's what a bad boy dragonfly does.
00:52:22.347,00:52:24.850,Would Dylan get this close to a lion?
00:52:24.933,00:52:26.977,Would he get this close?
00:52:27.060,00:52:28.436,How about this close?
00:52:28.520,00:52:29.980,Oh...
00:52:31.189,00:52:34.943,This is bad. This is very bad.
00:52:52.127,00:52:53.295,"Just kidding, he blew it."
00:52:53.378,00:52:54.296,"-Bye! -Oh, dear."
00:52:54.880,00:52:56.298,Stubbins!
00:53:00.343,00:53:01.344,Former resident here.
00:53:04.014,00:53:05.307,Don't touch.
00:53:09.853,00:53:17.193,"All I wanted was my daughter to marry wisely, and instead, I got the ringleader of a circus."
00:53:17.277,00:53:20.322,I never understood what Lily saw in you.
00:53:20.405,00:53:25.577,A common complaint the world over for fathers of beloved daughters.
00:53:25.660,00:53:32.334,"But in this instance, I think we can all agree, it is particularly accurate."
00:53:40.091,00:53:41.426,Come here.
00:53:41.509,00:53:43.011,I'm certain you didn't mean any of that.
00:53:44.429,00:53:46.556,It was her journal.
00:53:46.640,00:53:51.227,The only thing of hers my men found in the wreckage.
00:53:55.899,00:54:02.364,All you had to do was never show your face again and leave it at that.
00:54:03.448,00:54:04.574,You failed.
00:54:05.450,00:54:08.912,Now you'll pay for taking Lily away from me.
00:54:11.122,00:54:13.875,You knew what would happen if you returned.
00:54:14.834,00:54:15.919,Yes.
00:54:30.100,00:54:31.142,You should go.
00:54:33.687,00:54:37.399,"It's my past that's caught up with me, not yours. Yeah?"
00:54:37.482,00:54:38.400,But you're my friend.
00:54:38.483,00:54:40.568,Go. Don't look back.
00:54:51.079,00:54:52.122,Um...
00:54:52.789,00:54:54.082,I'm in compliance.
00:54:54.666,00:54:58.128,"Ho-ho! Yes. Finally, some action down here."
00:54:58.211,00:54:59.671,"Boy, was it getting boring."
00:54:59.754,00:55:03.049,"You know, Doc, I hate to tell you, but you're going down, my friend."
00:55:03.133,00:55:05.427,You'd do well to keep your buckteeth together.
00:55:05.510,00:55:06.886,What is that smell?
00:55:06.970,00:55:10.890,"Hey, fellas, I think Dr. Dolittle did a little doo-doo."
00:55:10.974,00:55:13.018,Did Dr. Dolittle do a little doo-doo?
00:55:15.812,00:55:18.273,and accept your lucky foot as payment.
00:55:19.941,00:55:25.864,"Don't worry about it, Doc, 'cause both of my lucky feet are going to be tap dancing on your grave when my guy's done with you!"
00:55:26.948,00:55:28.533,Taking bets over here!
00:55:28.616,00:55:50.472,"In the right corner, wearing golden stripes, with a sparkling record of 872 kills, Dr. Dolittle. Remember me, your old patient?"
00:55:50.555,00:55:52.223,It's Barry.
00:55:52.766,00:55:55.769,Barry. How could I forget you?
00:55:55.852,00:55:58.480,"Oh, but you did, Doc."
00:55:58.563,00:56:05.945,"We were just starting to make progress, and then you ran off with Rassouli's daughter and abandoned me."
00:56:06.029,00:56:07.238,"Well, uh..."
00:56:07.322,00:56:08.573,I'm back now.
00:56:08.656,00:56:22.921,"Er, perhaps we should just pick up where we left off-- Well, he's a dead man."
00:56:23.004,00:56:24.798,Yeah.
00:56:24.881,00:56:31.471,"He'll think he can talk his way out of it, but Barry has gone completely nuts."
00:56:31.554,00:56:33.139,But you...
00:56:33.723,00:56:34.933,You are one of us now.
00:56:36.226,00:56:37.936,To Dolittle's death!
00:56:43.691,00:56:46.236,-Psst. -Hey! It's you!
00:56:47.570,00:56:48.613,You made it.
00:56:51.366,00:56:54.911,A message? Sure. When have I ever let you down?
00:56:55.870,00:57:03.545,"All I hear, day after day, Why can't you be more like your brother?"
00:57:03.628,00:57:06.464,"He eats poachers for a living, you know."
00:57:09.634,00:57:11.928,The whole jungle knows.
00:57:12.637,00:57:14.097,"Oh, my head."
00:57:14.681,00:57:20.520,Your migraines are brought on by severe maternal issues and compounded by sibling rivalry.
00:57:20.603,00:57:22.981,Please make it stop.
00:57:23.064,00:57:24.149,"Oh, no, no, no."
00:57:24.232,00:57:26.067,"-Lie down. -Oh, my head."
00:57:26.151,00:57:30.572,We could resume your treatment.
00:57:30.655,00:57:32.782,The stress is unbearable.
00:57:32.866,00:57:35.660,I just want to be a good boy.
00:57:35.743,00:57:38.455,I just want to make Mummy proud.
00:57:38.538,00:57:39.956,There we are.
00:57:40.039,00:57:43.126,No one I eat will ever be good enough.
00:57:43.209,00:57:45.920,There's the release. Release it.
00:57:49.257,00:57:52.051,Unless I eat you!
00:57:55.054,00:57:56.598,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:57:56.681,00:58:02.103,Because every mother wants their son to grow up and eat a doctor.
00:58:02.187,00:58:03.438,You're a sick kitty.
00:58:08.485,00:58:09.694,"Come here, Doc."
00:58:09.777,00:58:11.279,I'll make it quick.
00:58:11.362,00:58:13.406,I've got another one of these in an hour.
00:58:14.741,00:58:17.911,"Give up, Dolittle. You can't outsmart..."
00:58:17.994,00:58:20.538,"Oh. What was that? Oh, wait!"
00:58:20.622,00:58:21.706,Now it's over there.
00:58:21.789,00:58:23.291,And now it's over here.
00:58:23.374,00:58:25.585,Now it's back over there. Got it.
00:58:25.668,00:58:26.711,And now it's over here.
00:58:26.794,00:58:28.588,"Oh, I lost it. I've got to get it."
00:58:30.381,00:58:32.383,Easily distracted.
00:58:33.718,00:58:35.220,"New game, Doc."
00:58:37.722,00:58:39.390,"Come on down, Doc!"
00:58:43.228,00:58:44.771,You've gotta deliver this message.
00:58:44.854,00:58:46.940,"Oh, no, it's James."
00:58:51.402,00:58:54.906,Whoa! Poly? Is that you?
00:58:57.492,00:58:58.952,"What happened, James?"
00:58:59.035,00:59:01.579,"Oh, right! Message. Huh. My bad."
00:59:01.663,00:59:05.375,"The kid's been captured by Rassouli, and Barry's about to have Dolittle for lunch."
00:59:05.458,00:59:07.669,Looks like we're going ashore after all.
00:59:07.752,00:59:09.796,"Be a darling and grab my dynamite, will you?"
00:59:12.674,00:59:15.927,We need to split up if we're going to pull this off.
00:59:16.010,00:59:17.679,"Chee-Chee, you're coming with me."
00:59:17.762,00:59:18.638,Where are we going?
00:59:18.721,00:59:21.266,"No, no, no, don't tell me. Just tell me when we get there."
00:59:42.787,00:59:44.956,"Oh, no! Worse than I expected."
00:59:49.419,00:59:50.628,"I got you, Doc."
00:59:59.053,01:00:00.013,"I got you, Poly."
01:00:03.433,01:00:05.310,"Any final diagnosis, Doc?"
01:00:05.393,01:00:07.353,Don't you want to be the best Barry you could be?
01:00:16.446,01:00:18.323,I'm not a prisoner of fear?
01:00:18.406,01:00:19.782,"Oh, no, no, no."
01:00:19.866,01:00:21.618,It's okay to be scared.
01:00:22.243,01:00:23.244,"Ow, ow."
01:00:26.831,01:00:27.915,It's okay to be scared.
01:00:27.999,01:00:29.334,You should be scared.
01:00:29.417,01:00:30.877,It's okay to be scared!
01:00:32.378,01:00:33.671,Give him a good hiding.
01:00:33.755,01:00:34.756,"Okay, we're doing this."
01:00:34.839,01:00:36.633,We are doing this!
01:00:42.555,01:00:44.599,Hit him in the low area!
01:00:52.523,01:00:53.816,Oof. That's gotta hurt.
01:00:53.900,01:00:55.276,"Ow, my Barry berries!"
01:00:55.360,01:00:56.235,That will work.
01:01:02.533,01:01:03.660,Wait...
01:01:12.919,01:01:18.383,Time to put those claws away Anyway...
01:01:19.717,01:01:21.969,You need this more than I do.
01:01:22.053,01:01:25.014,"Tell me I'm enough, Mummy."
01:01:25.098,01:01:27.350,I had 50 grand riding on that.
01:01:30.770,01:01:33.314,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner."
01:01:34.899,01:01:37.360,"Thanks for sticking with me, Doc."
01:02:00.550,01:02:01.968,I have it!
01:02:06.973,01:02:08.975,"And now, I'll have it."
01:02:15.940,01:02:17.275,She had such a sure hand.
01:02:18.234,01:02:20.945,Exactly what the doctor ordered.
01:02:26.033,01:02:29.412,"What did they offer you, Müdfly, to murder the Queen of England?"
01:02:30.997,01:02:35.626,"Quite a few things, actually. Knighthood. Windward House."
01:02:35.710,01:02:37.211,Chair of the Royal College.
01:02:37.295,01:02:39.046,In no particular order.
01:02:40.798,01:02:49.015,"Oh, and the icing on the madeleine will be the scientific accolades that accrue from the proper study of the Eden Tree."
01:02:49.098,01:02:51.893,All thanks to Lily Dolittle.
01:02:51.976,01:02:53.936,"Actually, no. That's still madeleine."
01:02:54.020,01:02:58.983,The icing is knowing that you know I won.
01:03:03.446,01:03:07.200,"Oh, and, Dolittle, I'm so sorry for that hole in your boat."
01:03:07.283,01:03:08.409,What hole?
01:03:35.436,01:03:36.813,Ahh! Help!
01:03:36.896,01:03:38.648,"I'm on it, Doc!"
01:03:42.151,01:03:43.945,And I can't swim!
01:03:48.908,01:03:50.201,"Got you, buddy."
01:03:50.284,01:03:52.745,"Plimpton, I'm not losing you, bro."
01:03:52.829,01:03:54.413,Step away from the light!
01:03:54.497,01:03:57.375,There is no light. I'm alive! I'm alive!
01:03:58.584,01:04:01.921,"I'm alive, thanks to you, Yoshi."
01:04:30.825,01:04:33.327,It's difficult to say goodbye.
01:04:36.873,01:04:38.124,It's all right.
01:04:42.712,01:04:44.338,You've done your best.
01:04:44.422,01:04:46.132,Your queen is proud.
01:04:51.053,01:04:53.764,"Where are you, Dolittle?"
01:05:00.104,01:05:02.023,Nothing about me is okay.
01:05:02.106,01:05:04.483,My father was right about me.
01:05:04.567,01:05:06.235,I should have been an omelet.
01:05:06.819,01:05:08.696,Pfft. I know how you feel.
01:05:08.779,01:05:14.368,My dad said he was going out for a pack of seals one night and never came back.
01:05:14.452,01:05:17.038,"I guess we got something in common after all, Plimpton."
01:05:17.830,01:05:19.916,What is this feeling?
01:05:19.999,01:05:22.585,I'm all warm and fuzzy inside.
01:05:24.045,01:05:26.047,"That's friendship, bro."
01:05:26.130,01:05:30.301,"Huh. Not bad, bro."
01:05:33.763,01:05:36.098,"I'm not crying, you're crying."
01:05:50.237,01:05:52.531,"Right. Gather round, shall we?"
01:05:52.615,01:05:54.450,Huh? Let's have a look where we are now.
01:06:00.998,01:06:03.084,"Oh, this is gonna be good."
01:06:04.877,01:06:06.045,I'm already getting duck bumps.
01:06:12.802,01:06:14.095,Cause it's a weird one.
01:06:14.178,01:06:17.098,I can sniff defeat like a truffle pig.
01:06:21.936,01:06:24.105,-We can still save the queen. -Nope.
01:06:24.188,01:06:25.731,-We can still save your house. -Whoa-uh.
01:06:27.733,01:06:29.485,I believe in you.
01:06:31.195,01:06:32.571,"Oh, you've got a point there."
01:06:32.655,01:06:37.326,"Except the journal's gone, we've no way to find the Eden Tree, and our boat is sunk."
01:06:43.874,01:06:45.626,"Chee-Chee, you are brave now."
01:06:46.210,01:06:48.170,Plimpton and Yoshi are getting along.
01:06:48.254,01:06:50.131,"Ow. Remember, back! Back!"
01:06:51.340,01:06:54.719,"And, Stubbins, you've made friends, and you can even talk to them."
01:06:54.802,01:06:56.429,You don't need me.
01:06:56.512,01:07:01.600,I'll stay here and offer medical services to this island of random bandits and outlaws.
01:07:04.729,01:07:05.980,Cash only.
01:07:06.063,01:07:08.774,"Ladies, gentlemen, who'd like to dance?"
01:07:08.858,01:07:10.776,I've got a bad case of dancing fever.
01:07:10.860,01:07:13.154,"So watch out, it's infectious."
01:07:16.365,01:07:20.036,"That explorer you told me about, she would have never given up."
01:07:20.119,01:07:22.163,"She was your wife, wasn't she?"
01:07:22.246,01:07:23.622,You wanna know the ironic bit?
01:07:24.331,01:07:27.877,I don't know what ironic means.
01:07:27.960,01:07:37.511,"Irony is when you find a woman, and she makes your life more wonderful than it had any right to be, and then, poof, she's gone, and it's all your fault."
01:07:37.595,01:07:41.682,This journey was my chance to finish what she started.
01:07:44.602,01:07:49.190,"Lily insisted I care for the animals at home, so I stayed behind."
01:07:49.273,01:07:51.358,Rassouli's right.
01:07:51.442,01:07:53.402,I should have been with her.
01:07:53.486,01:07:57.531,"Now, all I have left of her is the ghost I see when I hold our rings."
01:08:03.871,01:08:07.208,Not only did you lose my daughter's journal...
01:08:08.876,01:08:13.172,...but your polar bear blew up my village.
01:08:13.255,01:08:14.381,We don't know that.
01:08:15.299,01:08:18.969,And your gorilla beat up my tiger.
01:08:20.012,01:08:21.305,No good.
01:08:25.142,01:08:26.143,Let's go.
01:08:30.397,01:08:31.899,Mm.
01:08:31.982,01:08:33.234,Yeah.
01:08:38.489,01:08:54.839,"Irony is me wanting to kill you with every fiber of my being, but loving my daughter more."
01:09:04.431,01:09:06.100,"I miss her, too."
01:09:09.186,01:09:13.691,She would have wanted you to keep going.
01:09:26.787,01:09:30.791,"Get going, before I stop feeling sentimental."
01:09:35.254,01:09:36.964,She's saying we don't have a ship.
01:09:41.093,01:09:43.137,I have the perfect vessel for you.
01:09:50.895,01:09:52.771,"We'll just have to make the best of it, won't we?"
01:09:56.400,01:09:57.401,"Uh, who's that?"
01:09:58.319,01:10:00.779,Hi! I'm Jeff.
01:10:00.863,01:10:02.198,Crikey.
01:10:08.037,01:10:10.664,then Müdfly was well on his way to Eden Tree Island.
01:10:12.041,01:10:14.793,All we needed to do was track Müdfly.
01:10:17.463,01:10:19.548,"Whales, boyo."
01:10:19.632,01:10:21.258,Whales.
01:11:22.486,01:11:24.655,Eden Tree Island.
01:11:44.550,01:11:46.510,Extraordinary.
01:12:03.235,01:12:07.489,The map points us directly into the center of this mountain.
01:12:13.871,01:12:15.456,What the heck are we doing up here?
01:12:19.752,01:12:22.087,This is the widest branch I've ever scurried on.
01:12:38.395,01:12:44.818,"Some force beyond my comprehension still compels me to follow this crew of lunatics, the squirrel killer, and their deranged leader."
01:12:44.902,01:12:47.696,Perhaps it's the magic tree that draws me.
01:13:02.961,01:13:04.963,Foxfire fungus.
01:13:06.048,01:13:07.966,We must be near it now.
01:13:10.677,01:13:12.513,"Look, Doc."
01:13:12.596,01:13:17.393,It's lighting a path all the way to the man who wants us dead.
01:13:20.771,01:13:23.524,"Go on, then, soldier boy. Spoil yourself."
01:13:28.362,01:13:29.405,Oh.
01:13:29.488,01:13:30.406,"Hello, Blair."
01:13:33.117,01:13:35.536,"Looking for a tree, is it?"
01:13:37.454,01:13:39.623,Trees don't often grow in caves.
01:13:39.706,01:13:41.250,Didn't you pay attention in botany class?
01:13:41.333,01:13:44.253,"No, but pay attention to this, Dolittle."
01:13:45.671,01:13:47.923,I beat you!
01:13:48.799,01:13:51.135,You filthy animal...
01:13:52.845,01:13:54.179,...hoarder!
01:13:57.641,01:14:00.978,"So, where is it?"
01:14:01.061,01:14:02.521,Where's what?
01:14:03.856,01:14:05.649,The Eden Tree.
01:14:05.732,01:14:08.569,"Truth is, I haven't got a clue."
01:14:09.153,01:14:11.530,"Don't be ridiculous, you're John Dolittle."
01:14:11.613,01:14:14.032,You get everything you want.
01:14:14.116,01:14:15.742,"Not today, I don't."
01:14:17.244,01:14:20.164,"You really don't have any idea, do you?"
01:14:20.914,01:14:24.168,How does ignorance feel?
01:14:28.088,01:14:31.175,"One must hug uncertainty, don't you think?"
01:14:31.258,01:14:33.594,That's how Lily lived her life.
01:14:35.721,01:14:40.100,"Embrace the unknown, and the answers will be revealed."
01:14:40.184,01:14:44.396,"You sad, misguided nut, Dolittle."
01:14:44.480,01:14:45.814,Give that to me! Give me that.
01:14:48.692,01:14:52.112,I might find this damn tree on my own.
01:14:52.196,01:14:56.241,"And, by God, history will remember me."
01:15:07.669,01:15:10.547,Yeah. Something interesting going on now.
01:15:16.595,01:15:19.014,"God, that feels a lot larger than all of us."
01:15:42.871,01:15:43.956,He saved me.
01:15:44.706,01:15:50.671,I have a second chance to live a life of kindness and generosity. And...
01:15:55.884,01:15:59.263,"Take him, not me! I'm a good person now."
01:16:23.620,01:16:31.128,We're gonna make a run for that ditch while she's distracted-- -Get this off of me! -Cheech.
01:16:31.211,01:16:32.629,Help me! Plimpton!
01:16:32.713,01:16:34.631,"I'll save you, bro!"
01:16:34.715,01:16:36.174,Right. Think fast.
01:16:41.263,01:16:42.806,This'll likely upset her a bit.
01:17:04.745,01:17:05.996,Help!
01:17:16.965,01:17:19.676,Is he speaking dragon?
01:17:21.928,01:17:31.021,"You may be able to speak my language, but that does not make you worthy of the fruit."
01:17:31.104,01:17:44.868,"I know protecting the tree is your duty, but you won't be able to continue much longer, Oh, you know nothing of my pain."
01:17:49.915,01:17:51.416,But I do.
01:17:51.500,01:17:53.377,I've felt it as well.
01:17:53.877,01:17:58.256,"The kind that doesn't come from a bullet or a blade, but cuts much deeper."
01:17:59.466,01:18:04.638,"And how in every moment and every movement, you feel that pain again."
01:18:16.858,01:18:19.361,when you've lost the one you love.
01:18:45.512,01:18:47.180,Oh. Broken hearts.
01:18:47.264,01:18:48.849,What the heck are you doing here?
01:18:48.932,01:18:51.351,"Don't worry, guys. I got this. We're both dragons."
01:18:51.935,01:18:57.858,"Hey, just wondering, you know, dragon to dragon, if you wouldn't mind telling me where... Ow! Ow! Ow!"
01:18:57.941,01:19:01.069,She's really mad. I'll wait for whoever survives outside.
01:19:04.364,01:19:07.409,No. I think we're here to help her.
01:19:09.953,01:19:10.954,Yeah.
01:19:15.375,01:19:17.711,"Uh, I imagine it's a bit tender here?"
01:19:22.966,01:19:24.676,I pose no threat to you.
01:19:26.261,01:19:29.014,The emotional stress over the years has done damage to your stomach.
01:19:29.097,01:19:31.183,Get away from me.
01:19:31.266,01:19:36.730,"You have a severe impaction of the colon, and if I don't manually fragment it, it'll go septic."
01:19:36.813,01:19:39.316,You won't be able to protect anything anymore. Hmm?
01:19:40.233,01:19:42.444,"Ooh, that sounds like some tummy ache."
01:19:42.527,01:19:45.030,"I tell you what, give us five minutes."
01:19:45.113,01:19:47.240,"If you don't feel better, you can fry us all."
01:19:49.409,01:19:51.203,Just get on with it.
01:19:52.412,01:19:54.748,We have to get you on your side.
01:19:54.831,01:19:56.917,We need to perform an emergency extraction.
01:19:57.000,01:19:59.252,"Extraction? Uh, what are we pulling out?"
01:20:06.551,01:20:07.928,Turn.
01:20:12.307,01:20:13.683,Knew it would come in handy. Told ya!
01:20:13.767,01:20:15.185,Everybody knows what to do.
01:20:15.268,01:20:16.937,Just breathe. Works for me.
01:20:17.020,01:20:19.189,"It's okay, just hold on to my wing, sweetie."
01:20:19.272,01:20:20.482,Dab-Dab's here.
01:20:20.565,01:20:21.733,Oi!
01:20:21.817,01:20:22.692,You are my apprentice.
01:20:22.776,01:20:24.444,You keep her calm.
01:20:26.905,01:20:29.491,Did you know that the leek is the national emblem of Wales?
01:20:31.493,01:20:33.370,You might feel a bit of pressure.
01:20:33.453,01:20:34.830,I got her.
01:20:38.625,01:20:39.835,"Oh, no, you didn't."
01:20:39.918,01:20:41.628,"Oh, my gosh!"
01:20:41.711,01:20:43.463,"Ah, just clearing the way."
01:20:44.464,01:20:45.715,Is that armor?
01:20:45.799,01:20:47.259,You got the whole Spanish army in here.
01:20:50.136,01:20:51.221,Give us a deep breath.
01:20:53.098,01:20:54.641,"-Word of warning. -What's up, Doc?"
01:20:54.724,01:20:56.768,When removing the blockage...
01:20:56.852,01:20:58.103,"Yoshi, now."
01:20:58.186,01:21:01.106,...there may be an initial release of wind.
01:21:10.323,01:21:11.575,Respect.
01:21:15.745,01:21:17.122,We all do it.
01:21:17.205,01:21:19.291,We're all animals.
01:21:19.916,01:21:21.293,I can taste it.
01:21:21.376,01:21:23.879,"-Okay, I'm back. What did I miss? -Right."
01:21:23.962,01:21:25.213,"Oh, my gosh!"
01:21:27.007,01:21:28.425,We're in the home stretch now.
01:21:28.508,01:21:29.676,"Cheech, get behind me."
01:21:29.759,01:21:31.177,"I'm with you, Doc. On your call."
01:21:31.261,01:21:32.721,Heave!
01:21:36.933,01:21:39.477,Blood rushing to my head. Everything turning red.
01:21:39.561,01:21:42.063,"One last push, madam, if you please."
01:21:54.659,01:21:56.453,Thank you.
01:21:57.996,01:21:59.039,We did it!
01:21:59.122,01:22:00.582,Teamwork makes the dream work.
01:22:02.459,01:22:04.878,"That was a lot, but we did good."
01:22:08.840,01:22:13.428,"To put it simply, more leafy greens and less armor in your diet."
01:22:18.141,01:22:20.226,but nothing like you.
01:22:21.144,01:22:24.814,What unites such a group of creatures?
01:22:24.898,01:22:31.738,"Well, we may not look it, right, but somehow we just belong together."
01:22:31.821,01:22:35.825,Now let me help you.
01:22:54.594,01:22:56.846,We would never have found it without her.
01:22:59.849,01:23:01.476,and I'm not even cold.
01:23:40.223,01:23:47.230,"And that, if thou willst, thou canst yet raise her up and restore her to a longer continuance amongst us."
01:23:47.814,01:23:50.567,"O Father of mercies and the Lord of all, comfort her health in time of need..."
01:23:50.650,01:23:52.777,"I'm sorry we couldn't save you, Your Majesty."
01:23:57.449,01:23:59.701,It is with great sadness...
01:24:01.745,01:24:02.704,It smells like...
01:24:05.999,01:24:06.916,...hope!
01:24:10.211,01:24:12.088,...that the queen is no more.
01:24:12.172,01:24:13.631,Somebody call a doctor?
01:24:18.928,01:24:19.846,Dolittle.
01:24:19.929,01:24:21.806,Clear a path. There isn't a moment to waste.
01:24:25.769,01:24:28.938,I have procured that which is said to not exist.
01:24:29.022,01:24:31.858,"Behold, the fruit of the Eden Tree."
01:24:33.985,01:24:36.362,"I said, clear a path."
01:24:36.446,01:24:37.697,Seize them!
01:24:52.295,01:24:53.922,You were born for this moment.
01:24:54.798,01:24:55.965,I born.
01:24:58.301,01:24:59.427,"Mini, take flight!"
01:25:06.017,01:25:07.310,No!
01:25:10.063,01:25:10.980,"No, no, no!"
01:25:53.314,01:25:56.025,"Kevin's log, day unknown."
01:25:56.109,01:25:59.154,The killing has ended. Let there be life!
01:25:59.988,01:26:07.203,"Lady Rose, is there a giraffe in my bedchamber?"
01:26:10.498,01:26:12.458,"and a gorilla, and a parrot, and a duck."
01:26:12.542,01:26:13.626,An ostrich.
01:26:17.088,01:26:20.758,Our humble thanks be to God.
01:26:20.842,01:26:23.803,"And well done, Dr. Dolittle."
01:26:27.265,01:26:29.517,"Interesting. Carry on, Styx, I'm all ears."
01:26:31.561,01:26:35.315,"Er, Styx here agreed to stay behind, keep his 12 eyes on things."
01:26:35.398,01:26:36.441,He's just catching me up.
01:26:37.358,01:26:48.161,"Like all leaf insects, he speaks in eight-syllable phrases, What? He did?"
01:26:51.414,01:26:52.373,You're certain?
01:26:55.084,01:26:57.378,"No, I'm sorry. Styx is quite adamant."
01:27:04.844,01:27:08.056,"Oh, in his right pocket. The vial of Deathly Nightshade."
01:27:08.640,01:27:10.225,"Let's have a look, shall we?"
01:27:10.308,01:27:15.104,You can't possibly believe that he's talking to an insect.
01:27:15.813,01:27:16.856,Well...
01:27:17.523,01:27:22.195,"I've spoken to ladybugs, making a wish before they fly away."
01:27:23.029,01:27:24.572,Let's have a look.
01:27:26.950,01:27:28.284,Ooh.
01:27:33.539,01:27:35.333,No one messes with my family.
01:27:35.416,01:27:46.844,"Take one more step, and I'll rip you a brand-new-- To the Tower with him."
01:27:46.928,01:27:50.139,Ah! Someone's been a bad boy.
01:27:50.223,01:27:51.849,Come on.
01:27:51.933,01:27:54.394,And I don't know why you're all standing there.
01:27:54.477,01:27:56.437,Nobody's died. Leave me in peace.
01:27:57.313,01:27:58.439,"You, too."
01:28:00.733,01:28:02.902,"Not you, Dr. Dolittle."
01:28:03.987,01:28:06.030,"A moment, if you would, please."
01:28:08.324,01:28:11.160,"Lady Rose, who is this person, and why is he staring at me?"
01:28:11.244,01:28:12.870,He's Stubbins.
01:28:14.247,01:28:16.332,"Uh, I want to be an animal doctor."
01:28:17.500,01:28:18.793,He saved your life.
01:28:30.638,01:28:32.056,Thank you.
01:28:32.140,01:28:33.933,"It's good to have you back, Doctor."
01:28:44.152,01:28:47.447,I suppose it is nice to get out of the house every once in a while.
01:28:47.530,01:28:48.823,Stubbins. Mini.
01:28:48.906,01:28:51.993,Enough. We have far less important places to be.
01:29:10.595,01:29:13.348,There once was a peculiar doctor...
01:29:15.224,01:29:22.148,...who found he was at his best ...his extraordinary ability with others.
01:29:22.231,01:29:23.441,Excellent.
01:29:23.524,01:29:29.697,"Soon, Doctor Dolittle reopened his gates, as Lily would have wanted."
01:29:30.573,01:29:32.158,"Three more in the queue, gang."
01:29:32.241,01:29:33.409,Copy that.
01:29:48.591,01:29:51.177,that we can truly help ourselves.
01:33:01.826,01:33:03.202,You bats.
01:33:03.786,01:33:05.788,Show me the way out of here.
