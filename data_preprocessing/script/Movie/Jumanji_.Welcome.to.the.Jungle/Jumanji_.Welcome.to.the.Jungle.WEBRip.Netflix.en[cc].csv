00:01:23.041,00:01:24.375,"DAD: Hey, kiddo."
00:01:25.001,00:01:26.461,-What? -I found something.
00:01:26.628,00:01:28.880,You gotta check this out.
00:01:30.465,00:01:32.342,Jumanji.
00:01:34.135,00:01:35.261,Board game?
00:01:35.428,00:01:37.722,Who plays board games?
00:03:11.816,00:03:13.484,SPENCER: Parry. Parry.
00:03:13.651,00:03:15.570,Evade. Blam.
00:03:15.737,00:03:17.405,Uppercut.
00:03:17.572,00:03:18.865,Head slam. You're dead.
00:03:19.032,00:03:22.201,Strike. Strike. Counterstrike. Head slam. Ka-pow.
00:03:26.205,00:03:28.416,I got it.
00:03:38.468,00:03:42.639,"--Benjamin Franklin, and it was this sense of national exceptionalism..."
00:03:42.805,00:03:46.142,...that fueled the spreading wildfire of westward expansion.
00:03:46.309,00:03:48.102,-Spencer? Honey? -Ah!
00:03:48.603,00:03:51.356,"Mom, what did we say about the knocking?"
00:03:51.522,00:03:54.275,I'm late for work. Are you going to your father's after school?
00:03:54.442,00:03:56.110,"-Yeah, probably. -Don't forget your EpiPen."
00:03:56.277,00:03:58.238,"Please, remember, the world is a terrifying place."
00:03:58.404,00:04:00.907,Be careful of everything. I love you more than life itself. Bye.
00:04:01.074,00:04:02.200,-See you Sunday night. -Okay.
00:04:08.998,00:04:11.376,"-Later, Mama. MOM: Eat something before you go."
00:04:11.542,00:04:13.169,I can't. I gotta go meet Spencer.
00:04:13.795,00:04:15.588,"-Spencer Gilpin? -Yeah, Spencer Gilpin."
00:04:15.755,00:04:17.131,He's been tutoring me.
00:04:17.298,00:04:19.842,-He's helping me get my grades up. -I love to hear that.
00:04:20.009,00:04:22.553,-Little Spencer Gilpin. -Yeah.
00:04:22.720,00:04:25.515,"-Your grades gonna be okay? -Yeah, that's why I'm getting help."
00:04:25.682,00:04:29.727,I'd hate for you to get dropped from the team-- I'm not gonna get dropped from the team.
00:04:31.187,00:04:33.523,It's-- It's gonna be fine. Okay?
00:04:52.834,00:04:54.711,Okay.
00:04:54.877,00:04:57.755,"That's cute, right?"
00:04:57.922,00:04:59.590,Yeah.
00:05:21.446,00:05:23.531,"-Yo. -Hey, Fridge."
00:05:24.991,00:05:26.659,Why you wearing a raincoat?
00:05:26.826,00:05:28.870,"-What do you mean? -I mean, it's not raining."
00:05:29.037,00:05:30.204,Oh.
00:05:30.371,00:05:32.999,"Well, it might. I mean, you never know what's gonna happen."
00:05:34.792,00:05:37.170,"-Oy vey. Do you mind? -What the hell, man?"
00:05:37.336,00:05:40.882,Can we just speed this up? Freak House makes me very uncomfortable.
00:05:41.632,00:05:42.967,Here you go.
00:05:44.552,00:05:46.679,"-You proofread everything? -Yeah, I proofed it."
00:05:46.846,00:05:49.432,And I gave it a beginning...
00:05:50.016,00:05:52.477,...and an ending and some in the middle.
00:05:52.643,00:05:55.188,"I would've done it myself, if I had the time or whatever..."
00:05:55.354,00:05:57.356,"-...but.... -Yeah, it's no big deal."
00:05:57.523,00:06:00.485,"Hey, man, I was thinking, so.... I mean, it's been really fun..."
00:06:00.651,00:06:02.987,...doing your papers and your homework and stuff...
00:06:03.154,00:06:04.822,...but I don't know what you're doing this weekend...
00:06:04.989,00:06:07.742,-...but I was thinking we could-- -This weekend. Yeah.... Ah.
00:06:09.368,00:06:10.828,"-Hey, Fridge. -Hey."
00:06:11.579,00:06:13.331,You need a ride?
00:06:13.498,00:06:15.500,-I'm going with her. -You know what?
00:06:15.666,00:06:19.253,"That's actually better for me, scheduling-wise, too, so...."
00:06:19.420,00:06:21.005,"See you later, Refrigerator."
00:06:21.964,00:06:24.008,Sorry. Sorry.
00:06:24.550,00:06:26.385,"What up, girl?"
00:06:27.845,00:06:29.514,Whatever.
00:06:29.931,00:06:32.975,It's not like I was your best friend for your entire childhood.
00:06:33.142,00:06:34.519,-That's fine. MAN: What'd you say?
00:06:38.231,00:06:40.733,"Uh.... Nothing, sir."
00:06:41.609,00:06:43.402,"Oh, that guy is super weird."
00:06:43.903,00:06:47.740,That poor man. So awful what happened to those people.
00:06:48.908,00:06:52.078,-I was talking about the kid. -What are you doing out here?
00:06:52.578,00:06:54.831,I was just talking to my friend.
00:06:54.997,00:06:57.667,"You should be more careful where you loiter, you hear me?"
00:06:57.834,00:06:59.919,"Yes, Mr. Vreeke. I hear you."
00:07:00.086,00:07:02.630,This world swallows up kids like you.
00:07:20.898,00:07:22.817,BETHANY: It's been two hours since I've posted...
00:07:22.984,00:07:25.278,...and he hasn't commented. He hasn't even liked it.
00:07:25.445,00:07:27.530,"-You saw it. LUCINDA: Yeah, gorge."
00:07:27.697,00:07:29.240,I don't know what his problem is.
00:07:29.407,00:07:32.452,"Thank you. It's not like I post all the time, just enough to stay relevant."
00:07:32.618,00:07:36.581,"-But it's cute enough for Noah to at least-- -Hey, there's some rando behind you."
00:07:37.915,00:07:40.168,-Hi. -Hi.
00:07:40.334,00:07:42.962,"Bethany, did you just make a call during the quiz?"
00:07:43.129,00:07:44.922,Yeah. But I finished my quiz already.
00:07:45.089,00:07:48.551,"Oh, okay. Well, have you noticed that other people haven't?"
00:07:49.927,00:07:53.014,"-So? -Oh, I'm sorry. Let me back up."
00:07:53.181,00:07:56.267,"You're aware there are other people in the world, right?"
00:07:57.685,00:08:02.231,"Look, um, you know, I'm dealing with something right now, and..."
00:08:02.398,00:08:03.941,...I'm no happier about it than you are.
00:08:04.108,00:08:06.652,"I'm having a crisis, and Lucinda, I mean..."
00:08:06.819,00:08:10.698,"...she's supporting me as a woman, and it feels like maybe you should too."
00:08:12.700,00:08:14.994,"-Just hang up the phone. -Okay, I'll wrap it up."
00:08:15.161,00:08:17.455,"-Bethany, hang it up now. -Two minutes and we're done."
00:08:17.622,00:08:19.248,And that's detention.
00:08:20.917,00:08:24.045,"All right, keep those arms pumping. Let's go!"
00:08:24.962,00:08:28.132,"-Bethany, you're late. -Sorry."
00:08:30.051,00:08:32.261,I heard she broke up with that football guy.
00:08:33.262,00:08:35.223,"This could be your opening, Fussfeld."
00:08:36.599,00:08:38.643,"All right, we'll practice catching and throwing."
00:08:38.809,00:08:41.854,So partner up and grab a football. Let's move!
00:08:44.607,00:08:45.691,"Hey, Martha."
00:08:46.359,00:08:49.028,Martha. You can't play catch by yourself.
00:08:49.195,00:08:50.821,Pair up.
00:08:50.988,00:08:52.406,Come on. Let's go.
00:08:52.782,00:08:54.283,"No. No, I'm good."
00:08:55.493,00:08:56.953,Okay.
00:09:00.373,00:09:02.959,You have to participate just like everybody else.
00:09:03.125,00:09:05.336,"Otherwise, why are you even here?"
00:09:05.503,00:09:06.671,It's a requirement.
00:09:06.837,00:09:08.464,-Martha-- -I think it's pointless.
00:09:08.631,00:09:10.466,Gym class is not gonna get me into Princeton...
00:09:10.633,00:09:12.802,...and I don't understand the obsession with throwing...
00:09:12.969,00:09:14.971,"...a ball into a hoop and, Touchdown, five points!"
00:09:15.137,00:09:20.518,"Okay. There's a lot wrong with that, but first of all-- It's physical activity, which is good for you."
00:09:20.685,00:09:22.812,"With other people, also good for you."
00:09:23.145,00:09:26.274,"And if you try it, you might even have some fun."
00:09:26.440,00:09:28.901,Fun. That's what we're doing here? Fun?
00:09:29.068,00:09:30.403,This is school.
00:09:30.570,00:09:32.989,We are supposed to be learning things that actually matter.
00:09:33.155,00:09:35.575,"-Okay, Martha.... -We don't have a lot of time in this life..."
00:09:35.741,00:09:39.620,"...and I personally don't wanna waste it on being, like, a gym teacher."
00:09:41.956,00:09:45.084,"-That-- That-- That came out wrong. -Yeah, it sure did."
00:09:45.585,00:09:46.669,That's detention.
00:09:48.129,00:09:50.506,That was hard-core.
00:09:50.923,00:09:52.633,Badass.
00:09:52.800,00:09:54.719,Spencer Gilpin?
00:09:58.848,00:09:59.890,"Have a seat, Spencer."
00:10:11.110,00:10:12.194,Miss Mathers?
00:10:12.361,00:10:14.697,And it was this sense of national exceptionalism...
00:10:14.864,00:10:18.826,...that fueled the spreading wildfire of westward expansion.
00:10:18.993,00:10:21.454,"Does that sound familiar, Mr. Gilpin?"
00:10:23.581,00:10:25.791,-It does not. -It's the last sentence...
00:10:25.958,00:10:28.252,...of Anthony's paper on westward expansion.
00:10:28.419,00:10:30.963,"And, coincidentally, it's the last sentence..."
00:10:31.130,00:10:34.759,...of your paper on westward expansion from last year.
00:10:36.969,00:10:38.596,That's interesting.
00:10:39.180,00:10:40.514,MATHERS: Is it?
00:10:40.681,00:10:43.684,"I think so. I mean, what are the odds of that?"
00:10:43.851,00:10:45.311,Slim.
00:10:45.853,00:10:48.272,"MATHERS: Yeah, you also used the same metaphor..."
00:10:48.439,00:10:50.524,"...the spreading wildfire, in your papers..."
00:10:50.691,00:10:53.819,"...on the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Gettysburg..."
00:10:53.986,00:10:56.322,...and the women's suffrage movement.
00:10:59.116,00:11:01.160,It's so hot in this room.
00:11:01.786,00:11:05.039,"Anthony, I know how much you need to pass my class..."
00:11:05.206,00:11:06.874,...but this is not how you're gonna do it.
00:11:07.041,00:11:09.502,-I will not tolerate cheating. -Cheating?
00:11:09.669,00:11:12.630,-I didn't-- I didn't-- I didn't cheat. -It was my fault.
00:11:13.839,00:11:15.341,I made him do it.
00:11:15.925,00:11:17.843,BENTLEY: You made him...
00:11:18.344,00:11:21.180,...have you write his paper?
00:11:22.598,00:11:24.016,Yeah.
00:11:24.683,00:11:25.810,Mm-hm.
00:11:28.354,00:11:31.023,"Look. I'm sorry, okay?"
00:11:31.190,00:11:33.901,"No, no, it's not okay."
00:11:34.068,00:11:36.570,"What the hell, man? You got me kicked off the team."
00:11:36.737,00:11:39.448,You could've gotten me expelled. It's not like you're the only one...
00:11:39.615,00:11:40.908,...who's living dangerously here.
00:11:41.075,00:11:42.743,-Living dangerously? -Yes.
00:11:42.910,00:11:45.830,This is the most dangerous thing I've ever done in my life.
00:11:46.539,00:11:48.249,And now look at me.
00:11:48.416,00:11:50.209,I'm paying the price.
00:11:51.627,00:11:54.213,"Well, isn't this a fun group?"
00:11:54.380,00:11:56.924,Welcome to detention.
00:11:57.925,00:11:59.927,"-Yes, Spencer? -I wanna say that I'm sorry."
00:12:00.594,00:12:05.933,"-Thank you. -Principal Bentley, all I did was make-- Bethany, please. You're all here for a reason. You know what it is."
00:12:06.100,00:12:11.981,But this is what you should be thinking about: Who you are...
00:12:12.148,00:12:13.607,...in this moment in time...
00:12:13.774,00:12:15.776,...and who you want to be.
00:12:16.694,00:12:18.696,You get one life.
00:12:19.155,00:12:21.198,You decide how you're gonna spend it.
00:12:23.451,00:12:25.035,Fortunately...
00:12:25.202,00:12:27.705,...there is no better place for self-reflection...
00:12:27.872,00:12:29.248,...than detention.
00:12:29.415,00:12:31.459,"Get up, everybody. Let's go."
00:12:44.763,00:12:47.057,We are turning this into a new computer center.
00:12:47.224,00:12:49.477,"But before we do, it has to be cleaned out."
00:12:49.643,00:12:52.062,These old magazines are bound for the recycling plant.
00:12:52.229,00:12:54.315,But they have to be prepped before they go.
00:12:55.024,00:12:58.861,It seems all the staples must be removed.
00:12:59.028,00:13:01.864,"Whatever you don't finish today, you finish tomorrow."
00:13:02.031,00:13:04.200,-Tomorrow's Saturday. -Because I wouldn't play football?
00:13:04.366,00:13:06.202,-I don't think that'll work. -That's fair.
00:13:09.955,00:13:12.082,Choose your weapons.
00:13:21.967,00:13:23.844,"Seriously, no reception?"
00:13:24.011,00:13:27.264,"-Okay, can today get any worse? -Are you gonna help?"
00:13:27.431,00:13:28.682,Or are you too pretty?
00:13:29.266,00:13:30.518,I'm too pretty.
00:13:35.856,00:13:38.526,Hey. I was watching you with Coach Web today.
00:13:38.901,00:13:43.989,"I wasn't watching you, I wasn't-- Not, like, in a weird way. I just-- I was in the room. We're in the same class."
00:13:44.365,00:13:46.617,I thought you were saying some really smart things...
00:13:46.784,00:13:50.204,"...about why P.E. sucks and, um..."
00:13:50.371,00:13:52.206,...about other subjects.
00:13:53.207,00:13:54.708,Thanks.
00:13:55.668,00:13:56.919,Yeah.
00:14:01.840,00:14:03.968,Yo. What's this?
00:14:05.427,00:14:07.263,"-I don't know. FRIDGE: What is it, like..."
00:14:07.429,00:14:09.223,...some type of old-school Nintendo?
00:14:09.807,00:14:11.308,I don't think so.
00:14:12.059,00:14:13.227,I don't recognize it.
00:14:31.245,00:14:33.998,SPENCER: A game for those who seek to find...
00:14:34.164,00:14:36.542,...a way to leave their world behind.
00:14:38.794,00:14:40.754,Jumanji.
00:14:40.921,00:14:42.381,"Staples, people. Staples."
00:14:42.548,00:14:45.718,-Jumanji? What does that mean? -I have no idea. Never heard of it.
00:14:48.804,00:14:50.306,Hm.
00:14:50.598,00:14:52.057,"Uh, which one do I pick?"
00:14:52.224,00:14:54.351,I don't know. I don't think it matters that much.
00:14:55.019,00:14:56.937,Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough...
00:14:57.104,00:14:58.480,...pilot and rascal.
00:14:59.732,00:15:02.568,"-It's not working. -Okay, try another one."
00:15:02.735,00:15:05.154,Franklin 'Moose' Finbar.
00:15:05.946,00:15:08.157,Hm. He sounds like a badass.
00:15:08.657,00:15:11.243,"And he's a zoology expert, which is awesome."
00:15:14.246,00:15:16.123,FRIDGE: You pick. -Okay.
00:15:17.750,00:15:21.462,Dr. Smolder Bravestone.
00:15:23.589,00:15:25.549,"Bethany, you in?"
00:15:25.716,00:15:27.176,Fine.
00:15:30.387,00:15:31.513,I'll be...
00:15:31.680,00:15:33.724,...Shelly Oberon...
00:15:33.891,00:15:35.184,...the curvy genius.
00:15:36.644,00:15:38.938,"Hey, yo, Staples, come on. It's your turn."
00:15:39.104,00:15:40.397,"Uh, no."
00:15:40.564,00:15:42.900,"-No, thanks. -Wait. Just for a few minutes?"
00:15:43.901,00:15:46.028,-It'll be fun. -She's not big on fun.
00:15:49.698,00:15:52.368,Okay. Fine.
00:15:55.913,00:15:58.582,This may be the lamest thing I've ever done.
00:15:58.749,00:16:00.960,I highly doubt that.
00:16:06.298,00:16:07.758,NIGEL: Welcome to Jumanji!
00:16:18.936,00:16:20.104,What's going on?
00:16:24.233,00:16:26.068,I think it's shorting out.
00:16:32.324,00:16:34.076,MARTHA: Unplug it!
00:16:38.998,00:16:40.666,BETHANY: Aah! FRIDGE: Whoa!
00:16:42.459,00:16:44.545,What's going on? What's happening to your hands?
00:16:44.712,00:16:47.131,-What's wrong with you? -I don't know.
00:16:49.758,00:16:51.593,-Aah! -Spencer!
00:16:52.678,00:16:55.097,"-Oh! Oh, my God! MARTHA: Oh...."
00:17:03.522,00:17:04.982,"What the hell, man?"
00:17:05.149,00:17:06.483,"Oh, no."
00:17:06.650,00:17:45.939,Holy shit-- Guys?
00:17:46.398,00:17:49.526,Guys? Why do I sound like this?
00:17:56.784,00:17:58.577,Where's my hair?
00:18:08.921,00:18:10.672,What the...?
00:18:10.839,00:18:12.591,"Oh, God!"
00:18:35.322,00:18:37.783,What kind of stupid-ass...?
00:18:39.868,00:18:41.829,-Who are you? -Who are you?
00:18:44.373,00:18:45.958,Who is she?
00:18:46.875,00:18:48.794,Who are you guys? Huh?
00:18:48.961,00:18:50.712,"-Okay, what the hell? -Oh!"
00:18:50.921,00:18:52.798,"MAN 2: God! Oh, my God! MAN 1: Get off of me!"
00:18:52.965,00:18:54.842,MAN 2: I am totally suing-- What's wrong with my voice?
00:18:55.300,00:18:57.845,MAN 1: Get off! You're crushing me! -Where am I?
00:18:58.011,00:18:59.263,MAN 1: Get off!
00:19:00.472,00:19:06.186,Get-- Oh. Oh.
00:19:06.353,00:19:10.732,What the hell? What happened to the rest of me?
00:19:10.899,00:19:13.402,What's this? What is this on my back?
00:19:13.569,00:19:16.155,"-What is this? -Oh, my God."
00:19:16.864,00:19:18.407,Fridge?
00:19:19.283,00:19:21.285,"Yeah, I'm Fridge. Who are you?"
00:19:25.330,00:19:26.498,I'm Spencer.
00:19:26.665,00:19:30.627,What? The hell you are. What is going on? Huh?
00:19:31.295,00:19:32.546,I think...
00:19:33.255,00:19:34.298,...we're in the game.
00:19:34.464,00:19:36.466,"-Sorry, excuse me? -What are you talking about?"
00:19:36.633,00:19:38.260,"Somehow, I don't know how..."
00:19:38.427,00:19:41.513,"...I think we got, like, sucked into the game."
00:19:41.680,00:19:43.765,And we've become the avatars that we chose.
00:19:43.932,00:19:47.394,"So it's me, Spencer, but yet I look and sound..."
00:19:47.561,00:19:51.398,...like Dr. Smolder Bravestone.
00:19:57.112,00:20:00.490,"-You're telling me that you're Spencer? -Yes, yes, yes. That's it."
00:20:00.657,00:20:04.453,"Fridge, I'm Spencer. Which means you're Moose Finbar."
00:20:04.620,00:20:06.747,It says it right there on your vest. And....
00:20:08.332,00:20:09.708,-Martha? -Yeah.
00:20:09.875,00:20:11.752,You're Ruby Roundhouse.
00:20:12.169,00:20:15.797,"And, Bethany, you're Professor Shelly Oberon."
00:20:15.964,00:20:19.051,-Only Shelly must be short for Sheldon. -What are you talking about?
00:20:19.218,00:20:21.678,"-Oh, my God. Oh, my God, he's right. BETHANY: And you..."
00:20:23.430,00:20:26.767,"-...you're Spencer? You? -Yes. Guys, I'm telling you."
00:20:26.934,00:20:31.730,"I am Spencer. I'm-- -Yep, that's Spencer. -Whoa, whoa!"
00:20:31.897,00:20:34.608,So that means I....
00:20:34.775,00:20:36.360,I'm....
00:20:38.070,00:20:39.571,"FRIDGE: Wait, Bethany. Bethany, don't!"
00:20:40.906,00:20:42.783,No!
00:20:45.786,00:20:47.996,"I'm an overweight, middle-aged man."
00:20:48.997,00:20:50.707,Uh.... I have a tattoo.
00:20:51.250,00:20:53.543,My mom always said she'd kill me if I ever got a tattoo.
00:20:55.045,00:20:56.672,I have one too.
00:20:59.383,00:21:00.425,Sometimes.
00:21:01.176,00:21:03.011,Wait a second.
00:21:03.178,00:21:05.138,Where's my phone?
00:21:08.725,00:21:10.686,Why am I wearing this outfit in a jungle?
00:21:10.852,00:21:13.063,"Tiny, little shorts and a leather halter top."
00:21:13.230,00:21:14.564,"I mean, what is this?"
00:21:14.731,00:21:17.067,I look like a living garden gnome. Where is my phone?
00:21:20.153,00:21:22.239,It doesn't seem like the most pressing concern...
00:21:22.406,00:21:23.991,-...at this moment. -Really? You don't think...
00:21:24.157,00:21:26.285,...this would be a good moment to make a phone call...
00:21:26.451,00:21:29.496,...or text somebody or change your status to stuck in a freaking video game?
00:21:29.663,00:21:32.624,"All I'm saying is, I don't have my Claritin, okay?"
00:21:32.791,00:21:36.128,"-And I'm allergic to almost everything. -Oh, no."
00:21:36.295,00:21:38.714,"You got allergies, Spencer? Huh?"
00:21:38.880,00:21:40.632,I don't have the top two feet of my body!
00:21:41.049,00:21:43.552,"You guys, this can't actually be happening."
00:21:43.719,00:21:46.138,Maybe we're all in a coma.
00:21:46.305,00:21:49.057,Together? We're all in a coma together?
00:21:49.224,00:21:51.560,It's the only explanation. That old game machine...
00:21:51.727,00:21:58.775,"...must have electrocuted all of us, and now we're-- MARTHA: Oh, my God, Bethany! FRIDGE: Oh, my God, oh, my God!"
00:21:58.942,00:22:00.068,MARTHA: Stop it!
00:22:07.409,00:22:10.162,"Oh, my God! You better get in there and go save her."
00:22:10.329,00:22:12.247,I'm not getting in there! You get in.
00:22:12.414,00:22:13.707,I'm not going anywhere. I got a backpack on.
00:22:14.082,00:22:16.668,You don't get in water with a backpack. Everybody knows that.
00:22:24.926,00:22:27.345,-Ow. FRIDGE: What the...?
00:22:27.512,00:22:29.723,MARTHA: Bethany! FRIDGE: What just...?
00:22:31.266,00:22:32.476,Are you okay?
00:22:32.642,00:22:34.770,That was so intense.
00:22:34.936,00:22:36.688,"I, like, can't even with this place."
00:22:36.855,00:22:39.066,-What just happened to you? -I got eaten by a rhino...
00:22:39.232,00:22:41.693,"...and then I fell, like, a thousand feet from the sky."
00:22:41.860,00:22:43.612,"Yeah, that's what it looked like."
00:22:43.779,00:22:45.697,That was a hippo. They're omnivorous.
00:22:45.864,00:22:47.532,They're as fast as a horse over short distances...
00:22:47.699,00:22:50.285,...and they have the bite force of 8100 newtons.
00:22:50.452,00:22:51.620,How do I know this?
00:22:52.329,00:22:53.663,You're an expert in zoology.
00:22:53.830,00:22:55.624,"-What? -I'm still an old fat guy, right?"
00:22:55.791,00:22:58.126,-I'm afraid so. FRIDGE: Wait.
00:22:58.293,00:23:02.297,"Why is everybody okay with this? I mean, she fell out of the sky."
00:23:02.464,00:23:03.715,"Um, guys?"
00:23:07.886,00:23:11.598,"Bethany, get up. Bethany, get up. Get up!"
00:23:17.479,00:23:18.855,"FRIDGE: Go, go, go!"
00:23:19.022,00:23:20.315,"Go, go, go!"
00:23:24.069,00:23:27.823,Ah! Dr. Bravestone! Welcome to Jumanji!
00:23:29.908,00:23:32.369,Don't just stand there. In you go.
00:23:32.536,00:23:33.995,"FRIDGE: Go, go, go. -Yeah."
00:23:46.133,00:23:47.425,Dr. Bravestone.
00:23:47.926,00:23:50.554,Famed archaeologist and international explorer.
00:23:50.720,00:23:53.974,Known across the seven continents for your courageous exploits.
00:23:54.558,00:23:55.976,Is there a seat belt?
00:23:56.143,00:23:59.146,I can't tell you what an honor it is to finally meet you.
00:23:59.312,00:24:02.315,And I'm not embarrassed to say you're even more dashing in person.
00:24:02.482,00:24:04.484,Um.... Thanks.
00:24:04.651,00:24:07.195,-Who are you? -Nigel Billingsly at your service...
00:24:07.362,00:24:09.489,"...Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men."
00:24:09.656,00:24:11.283,Welcome to Jumanji.
00:24:11.449,00:24:13.326,I've been so anxious for your arrival.
00:24:14.619,00:24:16.496,"As you know, Jumanji is in grave danger."
00:24:16.955,00:24:19.374,We're counting on the four of you to lift the curse.
00:24:19.541,00:24:21.209,-Curse? -What curse?
00:24:21.376,00:24:23.628,Excuse me. Have you seen my phone anywhere?
00:24:24.421,00:24:26.840,Professor Sheldon Oberon.
00:24:27.007,00:24:30.594,Welcome to Jumanji. Nigel Billingsly at your service.
00:24:30.760,00:24:32.554,I've been so anxious for your arrival.
00:24:34.723,00:24:36.224,I think he's an NPC.
00:24:38.059,00:24:39.936,A non-player character. He's part of the game.
00:24:40.103,00:24:43.398,"So anything we ask him, he only has his programmed series of responses."
00:24:43.565,00:24:45.317,Got it. It's all clear now.
00:24:45.483,00:24:47.611,Franklin Mouse Finbar.
00:24:47.777,00:24:49.029,Welcome to Jumanji.
00:24:49.196,00:24:50.947,It's Moose. It's not Mouse.
00:24:51.114,00:24:53.450,"No, good sir. I'm quite sure it's Mouse."
00:24:53.617,00:24:54.993,-Mouse? -A nickname given...
00:24:55.160,00:24:57.829,...for your diminutive stature and adorable manner.
00:24:57.996,00:24:59.456,I knew you'd be here.
00:24:59.623,00:25:02.667,Dr. Bravestone doesn't go anywhere without his trusty sidekick.
00:25:02.834,00:25:04.002,Sidekick?
00:25:04.502,00:25:07.589,Ever since Dr. Bravestone rescued you from the clutches of a warlord...
00:25:07.756,00:25:10.634,"...in the jungles of Peru, you've never left his side."
00:25:10.800,00:25:13.511,-Right. -Can we go back to the curse thing?
00:25:13.678,00:25:15.805,It's all documented in the letter I sent you.
00:25:15.972,00:25:24.189,-Perhaps you should read it aloud. -I don't have a let-- Whoa.
00:25:27.400,00:25:29.027,Right. Uh....
00:25:29.194,00:25:33.698,"Dr. Bravestone, I am writing to you regarding the desperate situation..."
00:25:33.865,00:25:36.826,SPENCER &amp; NIGEL: ...in Jumanji. We need your help at once.
00:25:37.494,00:25:39.371,BETHANY: Whoa. What's happening? MARTHA: Guys?
00:25:39.537,00:25:40.872,FRIDGE: What the hell is going on?
00:25:41.039,00:25:43.375,SPENCER: I think it's a cut scene. A lot of games have them.
00:25:43.541,00:25:46.169,It's like a little movie to tell you the back-story.
00:25:46.336,00:25:48.004,NIGEL: My name is Nigel Billingsly...
00:25:48.630,00:25:50.465,...Jumanji field guide.
00:25:51.132,00:25:52.884,I was hired by your former partner...
00:25:53.051,00:25:55.512,"...now nemesis, Professor Russel Van Pelt..."
00:25:55.679,00:25:57.430,...to lead a fateful expedition.
00:26:01.309,00:26:03.270,"You see, Professor Van Pelt..."
00:26:03.436,00:26:05.772,...had come in search of the fabled Jaguar Shrine...
00:26:05.939,00:26:09.234,...resting place of the sacred jewel of Jumanji.
00:26:09.776,00:26:13.071,"As you know better than anyone, the jewel was his great obsession."
00:26:13.238,00:26:15.198,"And after years of research, he believed..."
00:26:15.365,00:26:17.158,...that he had discovered its whereabouts.
00:26:17.325,00:26:19.035,VAN PELT: Could it be?
00:26:19.202,00:26:21.371,Have I finally found it?
00:26:21.871,00:26:24.499,Van Pelt told me that he wanted to find the jewel...
00:26:24.666,00:26:26.835,...in order to document it in his writings.
00:26:29.587,00:26:31.923,-It's real! -What I did not know...
00:26:32.090,00:26:35.969,...was that he intended to take the jewel for himself.
00:26:44.477,00:26:46.646,I found it.
00:26:47.188,00:26:51.192,I found it!
00:26:53.153,00:26:56.197,Legend tells that the Jaguar watches over Jumanji...
00:26:56.364,00:27:02.120,...and anyone who dares to blind him will be consumed by a dark power.
00:27:03.204,00:27:07.167,Van Pelt assumed dominion over all of Jumanji's creatures...
00:27:07.334,00:27:10.628,"...possessing them, controlling them."
00:27:10.795,00:27:15.050,And a terrible curse befell this once-placid land.
00:27:16.801,00:27:20.680,"I begged him to put it back, but once he had it in his grasp..."
00:27:20.847,00:27:23.266,...he could never let it go.
00:27:24.768,00:27:27.562,So I waited till they slept that night...
00:27:27.729,00:27:29.189,...and I made my move.
00:27:51.378,00:27:53.713,Bring me that jewel!
00:27:53.880,00:27:57.300,And slaughter anyone who tries to stop you.
00:27:58.301,00:27:59.969,"Right, then. Here you go."
00:28:01.846,00:28:03.973,With the invaluable help of your associates...
00:28:04.140,00:28:07.852,...you must use your complementary skills to return the jewel to the Jaguar's eye...
00:28:08.019,00:28:10.146,...and lift the curse.
00:28:10.313,00:28:12.357,I'm sure you'll want to get started right away.
00:28:12.941,00:28:14.484,"-Actually, I think-- NIGEL: Good luck!"
00:28:14.651,00:28:16.444,The fate of Jumanji is in your hands.
00:28:18.780,00:28:34.170,"-What? NIGEL: And remember: The goal for you, I'll recite in verse Return the jewel and lift the curse If you wish to leave the game You must save Jumanji And call out its name Good luck! The fate of Jumanji is in your hands."
00:28:34.337,00:28:36.673,-And remember: -He's saying the same thing over.
00:28:36.840,00:28:52.105,"NIGEL: I'll recite in verse Return the jewel and lift the curse If you wish to leave the game You must save Jumanji And call out its name It's okay. You can handle this. In real life, people love you."
00:28:52.272,00:28:54.065,You can hook up with anyone you want.
00:28:54.232,00:28:56.735,Is that what you tell yourself when you're scared?
00:28:56.901,00:28:58.486,Can you not judge me for two seconds?
00:28:58.653,00:29:00.989,"I split up with Noah, I turned into a guy..."
00:29:01.156,00:29:03.658,...and I cannot find my phone. I am allowed to be upset.
00:29:03.825,00:29:06.619,"Dr. Bravestone, here's a map of Jumanji."
00:29:07.620,00:29:09.414,You must go to the bazaar and find the missing piece.
00:29:09.789,00:29:11.708,-The bazaar. MARTHA: Missing piece of what?
00:29:11.875,00:29:13.626,-Cheerio! FRIDGE: You can't give us a ride...
00:29:13.793,00:29:30.894,-...to the statue? NIGEL: And remember: If you wish to leave the game You must save Jumanji And call out its name You want to put this in there?
00:29:31.060,00:29:32.228,No.
00:29:32.395,00:29:35.315,"Come on, you're the only one with a backpack, Fridge."
00:29:36.441,00:29:39.694,So what? We have a map. So now we're supposed to go and find...?
00:29:39.861,00:29:41.446,"The bazaar, I guess?"
00:29:41.613,00:29:44.324,So we return the jewel to the Jaguar statue...
00:29:44.491,00:29:46.910,...and then we go home. No problem.
00:29:47.076,00:29:50.872,"Why can't we just leave, stop the game, without doing all this stuff?"
00:29:51.539,00:29:53.374,We have to finish the game.
00:29:54.667,00:29:56.252,I think....
00:29:57.670,00:29:59.923,I think we have to save Jumanji.
00:30:08.640,00:30:11.518,"Damn, that is a man right there."
00:30:13.937,00:30:17.398,"Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry."
00:30:18.066,00:30:19.067,Don't cry.

00:30:23.279,00:30:24.447,It's hot.
00:30:24.948,00:30:26.908,"SPENCER: Okay, this is what I'm good at."
00:30:27.075,00:30:31.663,Playing video games. It's what I do. It's literally the main thing that I do.
00:30:31.830,00:30:33.790,"Play a game like this, there'll be levels."
00:30:33.957,00:30:36.251,"In order to finish, you gotta complete all the levels."
00:30:36.417,00:30:38.545,Levels are gonna get harder as we go along.
00:30:38.711,00:30:41.589,-We complete the levels-- -Do you even know where we're going?
00:30:41.756,00:30:43.800,-Kind of. -Kind of?
00:30:43.967,00:30:46.636,"Oh, that's good, then. We're in good hands."
00:30:46.803,00:30:49.556,"Okay, the missing piece, I'm guessing."
00:30:49.722,00:30:52.517,"That must be what we're looking for, the missing piece of the map."
00:30:52.684,00:30:54.519,"The problem is, there's nothing here."
00:30:57.063,00:30:59.691,"What do you mean? It's a map, just like he said."
00:31:00.441,00:31:01.651,It's a map of Jumanji.
00:31:03.278,00:31:04.529,Cartography.
00:31:04.696,00:31:06.155,-What's that? MARTHA: The study of maps.
00:31:06.322,00:31:09.367,-It was one of Professor Oberon's skills. -Yes. That's right.
00:31:09.534,00:31:12.495,"Oh, so you can't see this, but I can?"
00:31:12.662,00:31:14.789,"SPENCER: The characters we chose, we all have certain skills."
00:31:15.415,00:31:19.878,So there's gotta be a way to access our-- Oh!

00:31:34.434,00:31:36.352,What the hell are you doing?
00:31:36.811,00:31:39.606,"-What just happened? -Um, you just smoldered."
00:31:41.149,00:31:42.191,Weakness.
00:31:43.985,00:31:45.028,None?
00:31:45.194,00:31:47.572,How'd you do that? That list?
00:31:48.031,00:31:53.286,"Well, I just-- I think I just pressed my enormous left pec."
00:31:53.453,00:31:54.996,FRIDGE: It's like the boob area. Let me show you.
00:31:55.163,00:31:56.247,Get away from me.
00:31:56.706,00:32:00.084,"At least press it in front of us, so we know exactly how...."
00:32:00.668,00:32:04.589,MARTHA: Strengths: Karate. T'ai chi. Aikido. Dance fighting?
00:32:05.340,00:32:07.634,Dance fighting? Is that even a thing?
00:32:08.259,00:32:11.262,Weakness: Venom.
00:32:13.598,00:32:14.766,Seriously?
00:32:15.850,00:32:19.145,Paleontology. What does that even mean?
00:32:19.312,00:32:21.981,"Study of fossils, I think."
00:32:22.148,00:32:24.817,-That's kind of cool. -Says the gorgeous karate badass...
00:32:24.984,00:32:27.403,...to the old fossil guy who doesn't have any endurance.
00:32:32.617,00:32:33.660,I hate this game.
00:32:33.826,00:32:36.037,Weakness: Cake.
00:32:36.621,00:32:39.165,"Yes, cake is my weakness."
00:32:39.332,00:32:41.626,Along with speed and strength.
00:32:41.834,00:32:44.796,-Huh. -Strength is my weakness.
00:32:44.963,00:32:47.090,"Hey, can I--? Quick question."
00:32:47.256,00:32:49.008,How is strength my weakness?
00:32:49.467,00:32:52.261,Somebody explain that to me. And why would I need speed?
00:32:52.428,00:32:54.806,Why would I need to be fast when I'm being chased...
00:32:54.973,00:32:58.434,...by an enormous killer zebra or some shit in this dumb-ass hat?
00:32:58.601,00:33:00.979,You're also a good weapons valet.
00:33:01.145,00:33:04.023,"-What does that mean? -Well, I think it means..."
00:33:04.190,00:33:06.025,...you carry my weapons in your backpack...
00:33:06.192,00:33:09.404,...and you give them to me when and if I need them?
00:33:11.030,00:33:15.159,"You guys. The map, it's changing."
00:33:15.326,00:33:16.703,MARTHA: What do you mean? SPENCER: What's it say?
00:33:16.869,00:33:18.997,"Okay, well, there's not a lot of information."
00:33:19.163,00:33:22.208,"But a minute ago, it didn't say this and now it does."
00:33:22.375,00:33:25.461,"It says, The Mighty Roar."
00:33:33.553,00:33:34.929,I don't like that.
00:33:35.096,00:33:37.098,-I'm done. -What else?
00:33:37.265,00:33:40.852,"Okay. And right here, it says From The Deep."
00:33:41.102,00:33:46.024,"The hippo came from the deep. The one that-- Yes, the thing that did the thing. Moving on."
00:33:46.733,00:33:48.568,If From The Deep is the first level...
00:33:48.735,00:33:51.070,...then The Mighty Roar must be the second level.
00:33:51.696,00:33:53.239,Which way?
00:33:53.781,00:33:55.241,Okay.
00:33:55.408,00:33:57.618,If that is that...

00:35:50.022,00:35:51.065,-Let me see your backpack. -For what?
00:35:51.232,00:35:53.442,"Inside your backpack, you have my weapons."

00:36:00.491,00:36:02.869,I can't feel no-- What's this?
00:36:03.035,00:36:05.204,"Oh, yes. Boomerang, it's one of my strengths."

00:36:07.123,00:36:09.208,"-Kill them, I guess. -Kill them with that?"

00:36:18.593,00:36:19.969,FRIDGE: Nice work. MAN: There!
00:36:20.678,00:36:24.307,Want me to see if I got a hacky sack for you to throw and do nothing with?
00:36:37.987,00:36:40.072,"-Oh. Oh, no. SPENCER: Wait, wait."
00:36:46.120,00:36:47.413,It worked.
00:36:49.457,00:36:50.958,Here they come. We gotta go.
00:36:51.125,00:36:52.627,I can't outrun those guys.

00:37:19.779,00:37:22.198,"Oh, no, no, no!"
00:37:26.285,00:37:28.287,-We have to jump! -Are you out of your mind?
00:37:28.454,00:37:30.456,I would rather do anything else right now but that.

00:37:42.009,00:37:43.594,-You gonna jump. Jump! -No!
00:38:04.991,00:38:06.492,SPENCER: I think I'm having a coronary.
00:38:06.659,00:38:08.202,I'm having difficulty breathing.
00:38:08.369,00:38:10.913,FRIDGE: That was the most humiliating moment of my life.
00:38:11.080,00:38:14.208,-Don't you do that again. -I took in a lot of water.
00:38:19.380,00:38:20.965,They got me.
00:38:21.924,00:38:23.551,"Oh, no."
00:38:24.010,00:38:25.511,Martha?

00:38:51.287,00:38:53.122,"What am I, a human landing pad?"
00:38:56.208,00:38:57.543,SPENCER: That's what I thought.
00:38:57.710,00:39:00.963,"We each have three lives, guys. These little tattoos on our arms...."

00:39:06.635,00:39:09.889,-You were saying? -It's our life count.
00:39:10.056,00:39:12.266,"Bethany got eaten by a hippo, so now she only has two lines."
00:39:12.767,00:39:14.226,He's right.
00:39:14.685,00:39:17.521,Wait. What happens if we use up all our lives?
00:39:19.357,00:39:21.567,"Well, usually that would mean..."
00:39:23.152,00:39:24.487,...game over.

00:39:26.781,00:39:29.075,Are you saying that we can actually die in here?
00:39:29.241,00:39:31.619,"-I mean, I don't know for sure, but-- -You're not sure?"

00:39:35.623,00:39:40.586,"So I'm not certain, but, yes, I'm afraid we all could die."
00:39:42.755,00:39:44.882,That is my big concern right now.
00:39:49.512,00:39:51.597,"We better find the missing piece, then."
00:39:52.139,00:39:53.557,BETHANY: Okay.
00:39:56.727,00:39:59.605,It looks like there's a village on the other side of this mountain.
00:39:59.772,00:40:00.981,Maybe that's the bazaar.
00:40:01.816,00:40:03.859,-Let's do it. -Wait.
00:40:05.277,00:40:07.113,I gotta take a leak first.
00:40:08.072,00:40:12.243,"I've been dreading this all day, but so do I."
00:40:12.952,00:40:15.955,Can I come with you and you show me how it's done?
00:40:17.039,00:40:19.083,I may need your help.
00:40:19.250,00:40:24.588,"Uh-- Uh, yeah, sure. Yeah, I'm-- I'll help you out."
00:40:27.633,00:40:29.552,So how do we do this?
00:40:29.718,00:40:33.806,"Uh, easy. You just, uh-- You unzip, take it out, fire away."
00:40:34.348,00:40:37.601,Remember to aim. It's very important.
00:40:40.312,00:40:43.441,"Oh, my God, there is a penis attached to my body right now."
00:40:43.607,00:40:45.568,"Martha, come look at my penis!"

00:40:47.236,00:40:50.114,-Is this the first that you've seen it? -Yes. I didn't wanna look.
00:40:50.281,00:40:53.075,I looked at mine within the first 20 seconds of getting here.
00:40:53.242,00:40:56.662,I'm happy to report that I was able to bring one thing from the outside world.
00:40:58.122,00:40:59.665,Are you--? What are you doing?
00:40:59.832,00:41:00.958,-Are you looking? -Sorry.
00:41:01.125,00:41:04.378,"-You don't look over here! -Yeah, you never look. It's a thing."
00:41:04.962,00:41:06.422,"Okay, good boy."
00:41:06.589,00:41:09.383,"We'll take this nice and slow, and nobody will get hurt."
00:41:09.550,00:41:11.385,-Now what? -Now blast off.
00:41:11.552,00:41:15.014,-And aim. Don't forget to aim. -What is with you and the aiming?
00:41:15.181,00:41:16.682,Can we not talk about this in mixed company?
00:41:16.891,00:41:19.477,Wow. Wow. Wow!
00:41:19.643,00:41:21.687,"Oh, this is so much easier!"
00:41:21.854,00:41:26.025,"-Heh, heh. It's cool, right? -Yeah, because you have, like, a handle."
00:41:27.151,00:41:30.070,The fact that I'm not Instagramming this right now is insane.
00:41:33.324,00:41:35.534,MAN 1: This looks all right. MAN 2: Up ahead!
00:41:55.804,00:41:57.097,Bravestone.
00:41:57.848,00:41:59.058,Him and that whole lot.
00:42:00.518,00:42:01.602,They got away?
00:42:02.895,00:42:04.188,We lost them in the jungle.
00:42:05.105,00:42:06.815,VAN PELT: I should have known.
00:42:09.485,00:42:11.946,"How do you mean, sir?"
00:42:12.112,00:42:15.032,I will summon every creature and every soldier...
00:42:15.199,00:42:17.201,...to hunt them down.
00:42:17.368,00:42:19.912,Reclaim what is mine.
00:42:23.707,00:42:25.459,Find them.
00:42:28.921,00:42:30.464,"SPENCER: Be careful of the ground, guys."
00:42:30.631,00:42:33.050,It's really uneven. I'd hate for anybody to twist an ankle.
00:42:33.217,00:42:35.678,-I did that once at camp-- FRIDGE: Please stop talking?
00:42:35.844,00:42:37.680,"SPENCER: Okay, sure. No problem. FRIDGE: Please!"
00:42:37.846,00:42:39.640,"-Can I borrow your jacket? -Yeah, sure."
00:42:39.807,00:42:40.849,-Thanks. -What are you doing?
00:42:41.016,00:42:43.561,MARTHA: I feel like I'm wearing a bikini at school.
00:42:43.727,00:42:46.063,I did that once. They sent me to the office.
00:42:46.230,00:42:48.649,-Of course. -Noah likes it when I show some skin.
00:42:48.816,00:42:51.777,-It's like the key to our relationship. -Ew.
00:42:52.695,00:42:56.198,"Judgy much? Seriously, I can't even open my mouth around you."
00:42:56.365,00:42:59.785,"You don't even know me, but you, like, decided you hate me."
00:42:59.952,00:43:02.079,"Oh, wait a minute. I don't hate you."
00:43:04.039,00:43:06.250,-You don't? -No.
00:43:06.417,00:43:09.795,"Look, I just think you live in, like, the hot popular girl bubble."
00:43:09.962,00:43:13.882,Where everybody either treats you like a princess or like an object.
00:43:14.049,00:43:18.596,Maybe it makes you a little self-absorbed or something?
00:43:22.224,00:43:23.892,That's fair.
00:43:24.059,00:43:26.395,But do you think maybe the reason why you're...
00:43:26.562,00:43:29.690,...so judgy is because you're afraid people aren't gonna like you...
00:43:29.857,00:43:31.817,...so you decide not to like them first?
00:43:32.276,00:43:33.819,No.
00:43:35.070,00:43:37.906,Maybe. Maybe.
00:43:39.074,00:43:40.868,"Okay, then."
00:43:41.327,00:43:43.829,"I'm just saying, you're a babe. Own it."
00:43:46.123,00:43:47.750,Thanks.
00:43:47.916,00:43:49.668,I guess.
00:43:57.092,00:43:59.595,"FRIDGE: I'm so sick of this game. Stay out of my way, Spencer."
00:43:59.762,00:44:01.847,SPENCER: What are you mad at me for? FRIDGE: Why am I mad?
00:44:02.014,00:44:03.599,Are you seriously asking me that?
00:44:03.766,00:44:05.309,You got me kicked off the team.
00:44:05.476,00:44:08.771,Then you got me stuck in whatever-- Whatever this is.
00:44:08.937,00:44:11.357,And you wonder why we not friends no more.
00:44:11.523,00:44:14.234,This is why we're not friends? You didn't wanna get stuck in Jumanji?
00:44:14.401,00:44:15.736,I don't think so.
00:44:15.903,00:44:18.614,We're not friends because I'm not cool enough to hang out with you...
00:44:18.781,00:44:20.908,...so you pretended not to know me anymore...
00:44:21.075,00:44:23.952,...until you needed me to do your homework because you couldn't.
00:44:24.119,00:44:26.914,No wonder you don't know anything about westward expansion.
00:44:27.081,00:44:29.458,"Okay, you see that? You know what?"
00:44:29.625,00:44:31.168,"I'm not stupid, Spencer."
00:44:31.335,00:44:34.838,"I asked you to do me one simple favor. Do my homework, so I don't get..."
00:44:35.005,00:44:36.965,"...kicked off the team, and you messed that up."
00:44:37.132,00:44:41.136,"Now I can't do the one thing that I'm actually good at, and it's all your fault."
00:44:42.012,00:44:44.056,I should kick the shit out you right now.
00:44:52.439,00:44:54.733,-I'd like to see you try. -What did you say?
00:44:56.985,00:44:59.071,"Oh, okay."
00:44:59.655,00:45:02.116,-I see what's going on here. -Guys.
00:45:02.282,00:45:04.910,"You think because you-- You, what, 6'4, 6'5..."
00:45:05.077,00:45:07.663,"...270 pounds of pure muscle, I'm supposed to be afraid of you?"
00:45:07.830,00:45:09.540,Is that what you think?
00:45:10.874,00:45:11.917,Maybe.
00:45:16.547,00:45:18.340,Let me tell you something.
00:45:18.507,00:45:21.635,You're the same annoying kid I've been trying to shake since seventh grade.
00:45:23.554,00:45:25.222,Ain't nothing changed.
00:45:25.389,00:45:28.225,Don't let this new body get your butt whupped.
00:45:33.939,00:45:35.023,Dumb-ass.
00:45:41.280,00:45:42.865,BETHANY: No! -Spencer!
00:45:43.031,00:45:44.658,Spencer!
00:45:44.992,00:45:47.244,"-You killed him! -Fridge, you lunatic!"
00:45:47.411,00:45:49.329,Chill out. He'll be back.
00:46:07.431,00:46:09.016,Don't call me a dumb-ass.
00:46:10.100,00:46:12.102,Don't push me.
00:46:12.269,00:46:13.479,"Or what, Spencer?"
00:46:13.645,00:46:15.355,Or I'll push you back.
00:46:23.155,00:46:24.698,FRIDGE: Aah! -Ooh!
00:46:28.202,00:46:29.369,Did you just smack me?
00:46:31.038,00:46:32.664,You gonna smack me?
00:46:32.831,00:46:34.958,"-Fridge, no. -Yeah, yeah."
00:46:35.417,00:46:37.002,Yeah. Huh? You wanna smack--?
00:46:38.837,00:46:40.380,"BETHANY: Oh, no, no, no! FRIDGE: Oh! Oh!"
00:46:40.881,00:46:42.466,-Ah. Oh. -Enough.
00:46:43.967,00:46:45.385,We can't waste lives.
00:46:46.553,00:46:48.055,We need each other.
00:46:48.597,00:46:52.643,"Like it or not, we have to do this together."
00:46:56.230,00:46:57.981,Could you say that one more time?
00:46:58.148,00:47:00.567,-We have to do this together? -But with the smolder.
00:47:00.734,00:47:03.654,"Do you have control of that, or does that happen naturally?"
00:47:04.613,00:47:06.114,It just happens naturally.
00:47:36.436,00:47:39.189,-What are we supposed to be doing? -Looking for the missing map piece.
00:47:39.356,00:47:40.607,So we just start asking for it?
00:47:40.774,00:47:45.237,"No, I just think we look around, we scope the place out, but most importantly, guys..."
00:47:45.404,00:47:47.114,...be discreet.
00:47:48.240,00:47:50.909,Rations! Get your rations!
00:47:51.076,00:47:53.161,Does anyone have any money? I'm starving.
00:47:53.328,00:47:56.373,Rations! Get your rations!
00:47:56.540,00:47:58.834,Rations!
00:47:59.001,00:48:02.796,"Guys, I think the game is trying to tell us to keep our health up."
00:48:03.505,00:48:05.632,"-We need to eat. -Okay, stop doing that."
00:48:06.341,00:48:09.303,"This is so good. I haven't had bread since I was, like, 9."
00:48:09.469,00:48:12.598,-Are you serious? -How do you think I got these abs?
00:48:12.764,00:48:14.558,FRIDGE: Let me try some of that.
00:48:15.517,00:48:16.852,Mm.
00:48:18.604,00:48:20.939,"Wait, what--? What is this?"
00:48:21.106,00:48:22.608,That's my famous pound cake.
00:48:23.108,00:48:24.443,Cake?
00:48:25.402,00:48:27.029,"Bethany, you said this was bread."
00:48:27.195,00:48:29.072,"It's been so long, I forgot what it tastes like."
00:48:29.239,00:48:30.741,How do you forget what--?
00:48:31.199,00:48:32.576,Something happening to me?
00:48:33.035,00:48:34.578,-No. -Am I shaking?
00:48:34.745,00:48:36.079,-Uh-uh. -Am I breaking out?
00:48:36.246,00:48:37.664,No.
00:48:38.040,00:48:40.125,-Am I still black? -Yes.
00:48:40.792,00:48:43.837,"Okay. Okay, right?"
00:48:44.004,00:48:45.964,We're fine. Everything is fine.
00:48:46.131,00:48:49.384,"Yeah, no, no, no, it's okay. It probably just meant that I love cake."

00:49:09.404,00:49:10.989,Ow!

00:49:13.909,00:49:15.994,"Like I said, important to be discreet."
00:49:16.161,00:49:18.455,"-Hey, you also said eat. -Rations!"

00:49:36.598,00:49:37.974,I'm a map doctor...
00:49:38.141,00:49:40.769,"...and I have this map that, like, has a missing piece."

00:49:45.482,00:49:46.692,Rude.
00:49:47.275,00:49:49.194,We need to find the missing piece.
00:50:23.353,00:50:38.910,"What you need is in the basket One false move, you're in a casket Trust one another, and never blink The missing piece is not what you think Oy vey."
00:50:39.077,00:50:40.996,"Good luck, mighty hero."
00:50:41.163,00:50:43.123,-Jumanji needs you. -Jumanji needs him. We know.
00:50:43.290,00:50:45.041,You said it several times.
00:50:51.006,00:50:54.760,"SPENCER: So thinking there's a, um...."
00:50:55.427,00:50:57.345,A snake in there or something?
00:50:57.512,00:50:58.805,Yep.
00:50:58.972,00:51:01.975,-Sounds like a Bravestone thing to me. -Why would this be a Bravestone thing?
00:51:02.142,00:51:03.977,You're the mighty hero. You heard what he said.
00:51:04.144,00:51:05.771,"Jumanji needs you. Now, get."
00:51:21.745,00:51:24.581,-I don't wanna do this! -Just go.
00:51:46.228,00:51:47.479,-Black mamba! -Oh!
00:51:48.980,00:51:50.106,FRIDGE: That's a black mamba.
00:51:50.273,00:51:52.192,A quarter milligram of its venom is enough to kill an adult.
00:51:52.359,00:51:53.902,You'll feel a tingling sensation in your mouth...
00:51:54.069,00:51:55.612,"...and extremities, followed by a fever, foaming at the mouth..."
00:51:55.779,00:51:58.240,"...and ataxia, which means loss of muscle control."
00:51:58.406,00:52:00.700,-How do I know that? -What do we do?
00:52:00.867,00:52:02.494,-See anything else? -I didn't have time.
00:52:02.661,00:52:03.995,"-Oh, my God. SPENCER: Okay."
00:52:04.162,00:52:06.623,Trust one another and never blink. Never blink.
00:52:07.207,00:52:09.960,"You guys, I think it's a staring contest."
00:52:10.126,00:52:11.461,-What? -What are you talking about?
00:52:11.628,00:52:14.214,-Think about it. Never blink? -I think she's right.
00:52:14.381,00:52:17.050,"At camp, they used to tell us if you see a rattlesnake, don't move."
00:52:17.217,00:52:19.886,I think someone has to make direct eye contact...
00:52:20.053,00:52:22.556,-...and not blink. -And then Spencer will reach in...
00:52:22.722,00:52:25.058,-...and grab whatever else is in there. -Why me again?
00:52:25.225,00:52:27.519,"-Because you're Bravestone. -Okay, fine."
00:52:27.686,00:52:30.730,Who's good at staring and not blinking?
00:52:33.024,00:52:34.150,I'm amazing at it.
00:52:34.860,00:52:36.111,Then this is your moment.
00:52:39.531,00:52:41.408,"Come on, Bethany."
00:52:46.288,00:52:47.330,Okay.
00:52:50.876,00:52:52.002,Just say when.
00:52:54.921,00:52:55.964,Now.
00:53:04.431,00:53:05.432,Oh.
00:53:06.433,00:53:08.101,What do we do?
00:53:11.396,00:53:13.148,-You gotta defang it. -I gotta what?!
00:53:15.317,00:53:18.486,You gotta pull his mouth back from the blind spot to disorient it.
00:53:18.653,00:53:20.488,But be very careful of the venom gland...
00:53:20.655,00:53:22.741,...and the exposed secondary venom duct.
00:53:22.908,00:53:25.035,And then you gotta snap its teeth...
00:53:26.995,00:53:29.247,-...out of its head. SPENCER: Oh! Oh.
00:53:29.414,00:53:30.749,Oh....
00:53:33.376,00:53:35.837,I guess it wasn't a staring contest.
00:53:36.004,00:53:38.924,Trust each other and never blink.
00:53:39.758,00:53:41.343,You trusted me.
00:53:41.509,00:53:43.345,"You trusted me, and I defanged the snake."
00:53:43.762,00:53:46.056,-I did it. I did that. -Yeah.
00:53:46.514,00:53:48.600,"-Yeah, you did it. -Thank you."
00:53:49.517,00:53:51.895,"Oh, yeah. Sure."

00:54:04.115,00:54:06.409,This does not look like a piece of a map.
00:54:06.576,00:54:09.162,The missing piece is an elephant?
00:54:09.955,00:54:12.707,"Oh, wait, there's something written on the wrapping paper."
00:54:12.874,00:54:16.169,"When you see me, begin the climb."
00:54:16.878,00:54:19.881,Begin the climb? When you see an elephant?
00:54:22.175,00:54:24.177,I defanged a snake.
00:54:25.971,00:54:28.723,"BETHANY: So keep your eyes peeled for an elephant, I guess?"
00:54:28.890,00:54:30.642,"That's, like, the next level of the game?"

00:55:37.542,00:55:39.669,That is insane.
00:55:47.385,00:55:49.220,Let's do this.
00:55:50.013,00:55:51.056,Do what?
00:55:52.599,00:55:55.226,Put-- Put it in my backpack.
00:55:56.186,00:55:58.813,Dodge! Head slam!
00:55:58.980,00:56:00.940,-Throw through ceiling! -Whoa!
00:56:01.399,00:56:02.776,Oh!
00:56:09.407,00:56:10.867,Oh!
00:56:25.548,00:56:27.383,"Hello, doctor."
00:56:27.926,00:56:29.928,Been a long time.
00:56:32.931,00:56:35.809,I believe you have something that belongs to me.
00:56:37.644,00:56:38.978,We just wanna go home.
00:56:44.609,00:56:47.153,ALEX: Come on! Come with me! Hurry! -Get him!
00:56:55.453,00:56:56.913,ALEX: Come on.
00:57:01.000,00:57:03.670,Down here. Come on. Quick!
00:57:19.769,00:57:22.063,Shh. Okay.
00:57:22.730,00:57:25.358,I need you to follow me and do exactly as I say.
00:57:25.525,00:57:27.152,Let's move.
00:57:28.570,00:57:30.989,"Oh, my God, you guys, I am so stoked you are here."
00:57:31.156,00:57:33.533,-You have no idea. So stoked. -You are?
00:57:33.700,00:57:35.743,"ALEX: I mean, I saw you guys in the bazaar..."
00:57:35.910,00:57:37.370,"...and I thought to myself, No way."
00:57:37.537,00:57:40.874,"And I then I was like, yeah, that's totally-- Backs against the wall!"
00:57:42.584,00:57:43.710,"FRIDGE: Oh, my goodness!"
00:57:46.463,00:57:48.089,Let's keep moving.
00:57:49.340,00:57:51.426,"-Watch your step in here. -Um, who are you?"
00:57:51.593,00:57:55.054,"-Yeah, and who do you think we are? -Right. Sorry, okay, my bad."
00:57:55.221,00:57:57.098,"Um, let me back up a little bit here."
00:57:57.265,00:57:59.225,"Wait, are you the pilot? Seaplane somebody?"
00:57:59.392,00:58:01.019,"-Yes. That's me. FRIDGE: Wait a minute, wait."
00:58:01.186,00:58:03.146,You're the other character that was taken.
00:58:03.313,00:58:05.315,So you're in the game too?
00:58:05.482,00:58:07.817,ALEX: Stay off the white bricks. And freeze. -What?
00:58:08.026,00:58:09.652,-Aah! -Oh.
00:58:15.325,00:58:17.452,So gnarly. Heh.
00:58:17.827,00:58:19.954,This game sucks.
00:58:22.332,00:58:23.500,Hup.
00:58:29.255,00:58:31.841,All right. Get this plank.
00:58:36.763,00:58:38.765,Follow me.
00:58:39.140,00:58:41.559,Careful. It's a horrible way to die.
00:58:41.726,00:58:43.394,"Oh, God."
00:58:45.522,00:58:46.814,There you go. All right.
00:58:53.988,00:58:55.240,Come on.
00:58:56.950,00:59:01.204,"I got it, I got it. I just defanged a snake. Give me a little respect."
00:59:06.251,00:59:07.627,Okay.
00:59:17.262,00:59:19.722,-Hi there. -Hi.
00:59:26.104,00:59:27.647,Come on.
00:59:40.285,00:59:42.787,"Anyway, I'm Alex."
00:59:43.121,00:59:45.081,Spencer Gilpin.
00:59:45.248,00:59:48.209,"Martha, Fridge and Bethany."
00:59:48.543,00:59:50.587,Bethany? You're a girl?
00:59:50.753,00:59:52.964,-Woman. -Heh.
00:59:53.298,00:59:55.508,"In real life, you'd probably wanna hit that."
01:00:02.390,01:00:04.601,They got away. Looks like they had help.
01:00:06.227,01:00:07.729,Seaplane.
01:00:07.895,01:00:09.856,He must've crawled out of his hole.
01:00:11.274,01:00:13.401,"I'm sorry, boss."
01:00:13.568,01:00:15.528,It won't happen again.
01:00:18.406,01:00:20.700,I know it won't.
01:00:35.089,01:00:37.008,SPENCER: What are you making? -Margaritas.
01:00:37.175,01:00:38.551,It's actually one of my strengths.
01:00:38.718,01:00:41.137,"That and piloting, although I did get shot down..."
01:00:41.304,01:00:45.558,"...by a couple orangutans in fighter jets, so maybe not that great at it."
01:00:46.768,01:00:48.478,"Anyway, cheers."
01:00:48.645,01:00:49.979,Ah.
01:00:50.605,01:00:52.982,-Oh. Thanks. -Heh. Sure.
01:00:53.149,01:00:55.193,I've never had alcohol before.
01:00:55.360,01:00:57.320,SPENCER: Me either. -You know what? What the hell?
01:00:57.487,01:00:59.322,-L'chaim. -Whoo!
01:01:05.161,01:01:07.872,-And I'm done with that. -It's good.
01:01:08.456,01:01:09.791,Can I get one more of those?
01:01:09.957,01:01:11.000,BETHANY: Alex? -Yeah.
01:01:11.167,01:01:14.337,-What's up with all these candles? ALEX: Citronella. One of my weaknesses...
01:01:14.504,01:01:16.923,"...is mosquitoes, which is kind of a bummer..."
01:01:17.090,01:01:19.550,...when you live alone in an open hut in the jungle.
01:01:21.010,01:01:22.053,He's single.
01:01:23.304,01:01:24.389,Who's this?
01:01:24.847,01:01:26.974,Who's Alan Parrish?
01:01:27.183,01:01:28.643,The guy who built this place.
01:01:29.477,01:01:31.646,"Wait, other people have been stuck here too?"
01:01:31.813,01:01:34.190,Yeah. This is Alan Parrish's house. I'm just living in it.
01:01:34.357,01:01:36.025,"BETHANY: So, Alex, tell me..."
01:01:36.818,01:01:39.195,...how long have you been in the game?
01:01:39.362,01:01:40.738,"Ooh, it's tough to say."
01:01:40.905,01:01:42.865,Time is kind of funny here.
01:01:43.032,01:01:44.283,"But a few months, at least."
01:01:44.450,01:01:45.493,-A few months? -What?
01:01:45.660,01:01:48.496,"Yeah, I can't seem to make it past the transportation shed."
01:01:48.663,01:01:50.623,Transportation shed? What's that?
01:01:50.790,01:01:52.542,It's the next level.
01:01:52.709,01:01:55.336,"First time, my hot-air balloon wouldn't even take off."
01:01:55.503,01:01:57.922,And then there was the whole plane thing I mentioned.
01:01:59.298,01:02:02.844,And once I got down to my last life...
01:02:03.010,01:02:04.887,...I realized I was screwed.
01:02:05.054,01:02:07.598,And that I was never gonna get out of here by myself.
01:02:08.015,01:02:10.560,"Half the stuff that came at me, I had zero way to deal with."
01:02:10.727,01:02:12.812,You can't kill a black mamba with a margarita.
01:02:12.979,01:02:16.899,You sure can't. You need a zoologist for that.
01:02:18.484,01:02:21.154,"Alex, we can help each other."
01:02:21.320,01:02:23.281,"You've been here a long time, you know the game..."
01:02:23.448,01:02:25.283,"...and between us, we have a lot of strengths."
01:02:25.450,01:02:28.369,Yeah. We're actually pretty good together.
01:02:29.495,01:02:31.122,"I don't know, bro."
01:02:31.289,01:02:34.709,"Okay, I mess up one more time, I'm toast."
01:02:34.876,01:02:38.212,Freaks me out even thinking about going back to the transportation shed.
01:02:40.840,01:02:44.218,-I don't wanna die in Jumanji. -We just gotta stick together.
01:02:44.385,01:02:46.262,"If we do that, we can win. I know we can."
01:02:49.307,01:02:53.603,"Oh, my God. You're our missing piece. You were the thing we needed to find."
01:02:54.103,01:02:55.480,MARTHA: So the clue was to...
01:02:55.646,01:02:58.608,"...what, go to the bazaar to find the missing piece?"
01:02:58.775,01:03:00.443,It wasn't the elephant.
01:03:02.570,01:03:04.614,-It was me. -Yeah.
01:03:07.700,01:03:10.411,"Dudes, let's do this."
01:03:10.578,01:03:11.746,MARTHA: Yeah. SPENCER: Yeah.
01:03:11.913,01:03:13.915,"-Let's do this. MARTHA: Yeah, let's do this."
01:03:14.081,01:03:16.167,"Hey, Spencer, you gonna drink that margarita?"
01:03:16.334,01:03:19.712,-I-- You're done. -This is one good margarita.
01:03:27.970,01:03:30.765,There it is. The transportation shed.
01:03:30.932,01:03:32.934,There's all sorts of vehicles inside.
01:03:33.100,01:03:35.019,"We gotta get one, get across the canyon..."
01:03:35.186,01:03:36.854,...and get to the Jaguar statue.
01:03:38.105,01:03:39.899,"Okay, I see the transportation shed."
01:03:40.066,01:03:42.735,"I see the canyon, but I still can't see the statue..."
01:03:42.902,01:03:45.696,...which is weird because it's the most important thing and it's huge.
01:03:45.863,01:03:46.948,That's what she said.
01:03:49.325,01:03:51.327,"SPENCER: You drunk, Fridge?"
01:03:51.494,01:03:53.454,What are you talking about? I ain't drunk.
01:03:53.621,01:03:56.332,-He is drunk. -I had three little margaritas.
01:03:56.499,01:03:59.502,"-Well, you're about half your usual size. -Whatever, whatever."
01:03:59.669,01:04:02.296,"Alex, what do we do? How do we get past these guards?"
01:04:02.463,01:04:05.049,"-Last time, I waited till they left. -How long did that take?"
01:04:05.216,01:04:07.802,"-Three weeks? -Oh, we gonna die."
01:04:07.969,01:04:09.720,Okay. Plan B.
01:04:09.887,01:04:14.308,Maybe there's another door somewhere. But we gotta distract those guys first.
01:04:14.475,01:04:15.768,BETHANY: I've got it.
01:04:15.935,01:04:17.770,"Distracting guys is, like, the main thing I do."
01:04:17.937,01:04:20.106,"He plays video games, I distract guys."
01:04:20.273,01:04:22.525,"Bethany, I hate to break it to you right now..."
01:04:22.692,01:04:25.736,"...but you don't exactly have the, um.... The tool kit."
01:04:26.529,01:04:28.406,Not me.
01:04:29.824,01:04:32.660,-What? -Go down there and flirt with those guys.
01:04:32.827,01:04:35.413,-No. No! -Hold their attention while we sneak in.
01:04:35.580,01:04:39.083,I can't go over there and flirt with some weird soldiers I don't know.
01:04:39.250,01:04:41.377,Right now we don't have a better idea.
01:04:41.544,01:04:44.672,You don't understand. I actually can't do it.
01:04:48.175,01:04:49.760,I'm terrible at it.
01:04:56.142,01:04:59.020,I'm not-- No. Heh. Not doing that.
01:05:00.438,01:05:03.774,You just have to distract them long enough for us to get into the shed.
01:05:03.941,01:05:08.404,"I really don't think I can, I'm not-- Like, I'm not actually some badass girl."
01:05:09.864,01:05:12.950,What are you talking about? You're a total badass.
01:05:15.745,01:05:17.580,You could do anything.
01:05:28.841,01:05:31.427,Or do you guys wanna get the hell out of here?
01:05:31.594,01:05:33.054,All right.
01:05:33.220,01:05:35.056,Show me how it's done.
01:05:37.266,01:05:40.019,"-Come on, girl. Watch and learn. -Okay."
01:05:40.770,01:05:43.481,"Hey, what did you mean by that candlelight-dinner thing?"
01:05:43.648,01:05:45.983,"-What are you talking about? -You said it, me and Martha..."
01:05:46.150,01:05:47.985,...candlelight dinner. What does that even mean?
01:05:48.152,01:05:51.614,"-The girl is into you, Spencer. -What?!"
01:06:01.082,01:06:04.835,"Okay, in flirting situations, the key is making them check you out..."
01:06:05.002,01:06:07.296,...without letting them know that you know that they're checking you out.
01:06:07.463,01:06:10.216,"You're like, Whatever, I'm doing me. When they try to talk to you..."
01:06:10.383,01:06:14.595,"...you can play it one of three ways: dumb, super into it, or nasty."
01:06:15.054,01:06:17.181,Which way you play it depends on what kind of guy you're dealing with.
01:06:17.348,01:06:19.725,This is like my dream and my nightmare all at one time.
01:06:19.892,01:06:21.310,I won't take that personally.
01:06:21.477,01:06:23.688,"Now, hair is everything."
01:06:23.854,01:06:26.774,Touch it. Move it. Play with it.
01:06:27.191,01:06:29.902,Move it around a lot. Hypnotize them with it.
01:06:30.069,01:06:33.489,"Give me a flip like that. Okay, now angle your eyes down."
01:06:33.656,01:06:34.699,"Now, head down."
01:06:34.865,01:06:36.325,Tilt up. Eyes big.
01:06:37.284,01:06:38.869,-Now sparkle. -Sparkle?
01:06:39.036,01:06:40.997,Like an anime character. Now sparkle.
01:06:47.712,01:06:48.754,Needs work.
01:06:56.345,01:06:59.181,-You really think she likes me? -Why are we still talking about this?
01:06:59.348,01:07:01.267,"I mean, what if she tries to kiss me?"
01:07:01.434,01:07:03.102,"Then you just kiss her back, man."
01:07:03.686,01:07:07.732,"Uh-- What if she tries to kiss me, like-- Like, without warning?"
01:07:08.649,01:07:10.609,Haven't you ever kissed anyone?
01:07:10.776,01:07:12.778,Don't-- You gonna tell the whole jungle?
01:07:12.945,01:07:14.739,"Guys, I found a side door. Over here."
01:07:14.905,01:07:16.949,"-Guess what I found. SPENCER: No, don't tell him."
01:07:17.116,01:07:20.161,"BETHANY: Okay, let's talk about your walk. Take your time."
01:07:20.327,01:07:23.205,Make a meal of it. Like a gorgeous gazelle.
01:07:23.372,01:07:26.375,Or a horse. High-step it. One foot in front of the other.
01:07:26.542,01:07:28.335,"And bring it. Boom, boom."
01:07:28.502,01:07:29.587,That's not it.
01:07:30.755,01:07:33.132,Yikes. Anything you can do to draw attention to the lips.
01:07:33.299,01:07:34.592,A nibble like this.
01:07:35.134,01:07:37.887,"A nibble goes a long way, girlfriend."
01:07:38.054,01:07:40.222,Good. That's better.
01:07:40.389,01:07:43.559,"Now, smile. You look terrified. Oh, my God, you're so funny."
01:07:43.726,01:07:45.686,"-You're so funny. -Oh, my God, you're so funny."
01:07:45.853,01:07:47.354,"Oh, my God, you're so funny."
01:07:47.855,01:07:50.399,"-I think I'm getting it. Heh, heh. -You are getting it. Go, girl."
01:07:50.566,01:07:54.737,"Now, keep your lips slightly parted, like-- Yeah, not gross, just relaxed."
01:07:54.904,01:07:56.864,Touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth.
01:07:57.531,01:07:59.450,-Like this? -Like this.
01:07:59.617,01:08:01.744,-Like this? -Like this.
01:08:02.578,01:08:03.621,Like this.
01:08:04.413,01:08:05.456,Like this?
01:08:06.707,01:08:07.792,I think you're ready.
01:08:09.460,01:08:12.838,"-Cool. -Okay, flirt like our lives depend on it."
01:08:13.005,01:08:14.090,Because they do.
01:08:14.256,01:08:17.968,"Okay, there's the door. We just need something to cut through the fence."
01:08:18.135,01:08:21.097,"Okay, Fridge, you got anything like that in the backpack?"

01:08:23.641,01:08:26.268,Here you go. I got some-- Some bolt cutters.
01:08:27.269,01:08:29.313,That seem like a good tool for the situation?

01:08:36.695,01:08:40.449,-...I think this is gonna work. -I think so too. She's pretty fly.
01:08:40.616,01:08:42.368,Those guys don't meet a lot of new people.
01:08:42.785,01:08:43.828,Fly?
01:08:43.994,01:08:47.873,"Well, not like Cindy Crawford fly, but for Jumanji, she the bomb."

01:08:49.583,01:08:51.335,-Cindy Crawford? -That's your go-to?
01:08:51.502,01:08:54.797,"I'm just saying, I'm sure they'd like to get jiggy with her."

01:09:27.872,01:09:29.832,That's probably not how I would've done it.

01:09:34.503,01:09:38.674,"No, we're not. Alex Vreeke. Everybody in Brantford knows about you."

01:10:43.155,01:10:44.865,"Bethany, what did you tell her to do?"
01:10:45.282,01:10:46.992,"Did she twist her ankle, maybe, or--?"
01:10:47.159,01:10:49.203,She's never flirted before. Give her a break.
01:10:53.874,01:10:55.751,"Hello, little lady."

01:11:23.696,01:11:25.864,She's forgotten all of our training.
01:11:26.031,01:11:27.283,Let's go.

01:11:37.293,01:11:39.253,About microbiology.
01:11:39.420,01:11:43.257,Which is one of my favorite biologies.

01:12:46.987,01:12:48.697,I hate this place.
01:12:53.452,01:12:55.788,Her strength is dance fighting.
01:12:55.954,01:12:58.290,"Alex, what do you think, huh? What's the move?"
01:12:58.457,01:12:59.750,-What? SPENCER: What do we take?

01:14:39.099,01:14:43.979,"Okay? I told you, I'm not a good pilot. Maybe we should take the school bus."
01:14:44.146,01:14:46.648,We can't outrun no motorcycle on no damn bus!
01:14:46.815,01:14:49.568,You picked the plane and hot-air balloon. Maybe pick the helicopter.
01:14:49.735,01:14:52.446,"-No, I can't do it. Okay? I don't wanna die. -Ah...."
01:14:52.988,01:14:55.449,I'm freaking out a little bit.

01:16:49.688,01:16:50.731,The collective is busted.
01:16:50.897,01:16:52.858,-What? -It controls the plate up there...
01:16:53.025,01:16:55.193,...which tilts the rotors and controls the pitch.
01:16:55.360,01:16:57.112,It's how we go up and down.
01:17:04.328,01:17:05.787,You guys?
01:17:06.371,01:17:08.665,-That can't be good. -No way that's good news.

01:17:48.080,01:17:51.708,You gotta connect the flight-control rod to the mesh plate under the rotors.
01:17:51.875,01:17:53.919,"Flight-control rod, mesh plate, under the rotors."
01:17:54.086,01:17:55.629,"-Wait, what? -I'll be right back."

01:22:16.389,01:22:20.268,"-Alex, talk to me. Wake up. Here we go. MARTHA: Alex? He's dying."
01:22:20.435,01:22:22.395,"No, we can't let him die. We're too close!"
01:22:22.562,01:22:25.941,-Does anyone know how to do CPR? -Start with three chest compressions...
01:22:26.107,01:22:28.944,"-...and mouth-to-mouth. -One, two, three."
01:22:29.611,01:22:31.613,"-How do I do this? -Okay, pinch his nose..."
01:22:31.780,01:22:33.490,"-...open his mouth, full lip-lock. -Okay."
01:22:33.990,01:22:37.243,"One breath, two breaths, then repeat."
01:22:45.543,01:22:47.379,"BETHANY: Come on, Alex."
01:22:50.090,01:22:52.550,"Bethany, stop. Your tattoo."
01:22:53.927,01:22:56.596,It looks like you're giving him one of your lives.
01:22:58.473,01:22:59.849,I'm okay with that.
01:23:00.016,01:23:03.603,-What if you need it for yourself? -I want Alex to come home too.
01:23:27.002,01:23:28.670,-What happened? MARTHA: Alex...
01:23:28.837,01:23:31.089,...Bethany gave you one of her lives.
01:23:31.631,01:23:33.675,"-Bethany, you okay? BETHANY: I think so."
01:23:33.842,01:23:35.135,"Bethany, is that true?"
01:23:35.301,01:23:37.262,You gave me one of your lives?
01:23:37.429,01:23:39.305,"I mean, yeah, of course."
01:23:39.931,01:23:41.683,Thank you.
01:23:51.067,01:23:53.653,-What? What are you looking at? -You got a situation.
01:23:57.032,01:23:59.659,"Oh, my God, these things are crazy."
01:24:14.758,01:24:16.718,"Twenty years, huh?"
01:24:17.802,01:24:19.804,"Yeah, I guess so."
01:24:23.683,01:24:25.101,You know...
01:24:25.268,01:24:27.979,...I just keep thinking about my poor parents.
01:24:28.146,01:24:29.939,And what they must've been through.
01:24:30.106,01:24:32.734,"And why, because I was sitting in my hideout..."
01:24:32.901,01:24:34.486,...too afraid to finish the game?
01:24:38.656,01:24:40.241,I'm sorry.
01:24:40.408,01:24:43.286,I don't mean to lay this on you. I'm just....
01:24:43.453,01:24:48.166,"-You're really easy to talk to. -No, I get it. I mean, sometimes..."
01:24:48.333,01:24:51.127,...it's easy to get so focused on your own stuff that...
01:24:51.836,01:24:54.464,...you forget other people have problems too.
01:24:56.049,01:24:57.175,That's really deep.
01:24:57.884,01:25:00.261,Thanks. I feel like ever since I lost my phone...
01:25:00.428,01:25:02.388,...my other senses have kind of heightened.
01:25:04.390,01:25:07.477,Does phone mean something different in the future?
01:25:12.107,01:25:13.983,"What about you, Alex? What are you like?"
01:25:14.150,01:25:16.694,In the real world. What's your vibe?
01:25:18.196,01:25:19.531,Full-on metalhead.
01:25:20.115,01:25:22.325,"A drummer, like my dad."
01:25:37.382,01:25:38.758,Hey.
01:25:40.844,01:25:42.846,-Hey. -What are you doing?
01:25:43.012,01:25:44.681,I was just filling these up.
01:25:44.848,01:25:46.850,-Cool. -Yeah.
01:25:51.146,01:25:52.689,"I'm glad you're here. I, uh.... Ahem."
01:25:54.774,01:25:57.402,-I have something to tell you. -Yeah?
01:25:57.569,01:25:59.070,And I wanna tell you now...
01:25:59.237,01:26:04.033,...just in case the next time that we talk I'm no longer brave.
01:26:07.036,01:26:08.329,"I like you, Martha."
01:26:09.789,01:26:12.208,"I, like, like you."
01:26:13.751,01:26:16.379,"Like, I'm fully into you."
01:26:17.005,01:26:18.464,-You are? -I am.
01:26:19.340,01:26:22.802,"And I have been since, like, the seventh grade."
01:26:24.846,01:26:26.431,Really?
01:26:27.390,01:26:30.310,Wowza. I don't think this has ever happened before.
01:26:31.144,01:26:32.979,"-What do you mean? -Like, I don't think..."
01:26:33.146,01:26:36.608,...anyone's ever liked me that I-- I can't believe I'm doing this.
01:26:36.774,01:26:44.282,"I never tell anyone how I fe-- I'm into you too, Spencer."
01:26:45.700,01:26:47.911,-You are? -Yes. Yes! Heh.
01:26:48.077,01:26:51.372,"God, you're smart and sweet and cute."
01:26:51.998,01:26:55.084,"Yeah, I'm pretty into you. Ha-ha-ha."
01:26:56.377,01:27:01.674,"Wait. Are you sure it's not because of, like, all of--?"
01:27:01.841,01:27:03.551,"What? Oh, my God, no, no."
01:27:03.718,01:27:06.429,That is not my type. I'm into nerds.
01:27:06.596,01:27:08.264,Really?
01:27:08.848,01:27:10.099,I'm a nerd.
01:27:30.286,01:27:32.747,-That was-- I was so awful. -I've never kissed anyone.
01:27:32.914,01:27:35.041,-You've never--? -Never. That was the first time.
01:27:35.208,01:27:37.627,"-I have never. No. -Oh, you haven't? Okay. Cool."
01:27:38.169,01:27:39.879,"-You can't tell, right? -Ha, ha."
01:27:43.174,01:27:45.051,"Aw, come on. Hey!"
01:27:45.218,01:27:48.304,"I don't wanna see that. I don't, not today."
01:27:48.471,01:27:52.642,"While you're here professing your love for one another, I found the Jaguar."
01:27:52.809,01:27:55.645,Let's go. God! Ugh.
01:28:06.406,01:28:08.825,-There it is. -There it is.
01:28:09.575,01:28:10.868,We'd better get walking.
01:28:32.974,01:28:35.810,I think we just follow this path.
01:28:37.145,01:28:39.397,No. It can't be that easy.
01:28:40.606,01:28:42.400,The Defenders.
01:28:44.694,01:28:46.070,What does that mean?
01:28:47.322,01:28:48.906,There's only one way to find out.
01:28:51.242,01:28:52.285,Fridge...
01:28:53.161,01:28:54.370,...give me the jewel.
01:28:57.915,01:28:59.417,Spencer.
01:29:15.141,01:29:18.019,-Something's about to happen. -I hate those drums.
01:29:19.270,01:29:21.522,"What, you're just gonna walk in there?"
01:29:21.939,01:29:23.566,No.
01:29:23.733,01:29:27.320,That's what the game wants us to do. Follow the path.
01:29:28.696,01:29:30.448,It's a trap.
01:29:36.329,01:29:38.164,When you see the elephant...
01:29:39.290,01:29:41.375,...begin the climb.
01:29:47.090,01:29:48.424,I'll go through the trees.
01:29:48.591,01:29:49.884,-The trees? -Yeah.
01:29:50.051,01:29:52.178,-You think that's what that means? -That must be it.
01:29:52.637,01:29:54.430,That's the move.
01:29:54.597,01:29:57.183,This is the final level of the game.
01:29:57.350,01:30:00.603,And I'm pretty sure this is a Bravestone thing.
01:30:05.274,01:30:07.819,Did he just refer to himself in the third person?
01:30:07.985,01:30:10.780,"Um, fourth person, I think."
01:30:17.537,01:30:18.746,How does he do that?
01:30:19.622,01:30:21.791,Climbing is one of his strengths.
01:30:21.958,01:30:24.085,Ah. Gotcha.
01:30:24.252,01:30:26.504,Cake makes me explode.
01:30:47.817,01:30:51.279,"-No! Spencer! -Oh, my God!"
01:30:51.445,01:30:52.947,FRIDGE: Spencer!
01:30:53.614,01:30:55.616,Spencer!
01:31:00.955,01:31:03.875,"-Oh, my God, you guys. Panthers. -No."
01:31:08.337,01:31:10.548,Those are jaguars.
01:31:31.402,01:31:32.570,Spencer!
01:31:33.321,01:31:37.074,"-Oh, my God. Are you okay? -Yeah. I think so."
01:31:37.241,01:31:39.202,"You still have the jewel, right?"
01:31:40.119,01:31:41.454,"-I got it. -Oh, thank God."
01:31:41.621,01:31:44.248,"-Hey, what happened? -I don't wanna talk about it."
01:31:45.333,01:31:46.834,"BETHANY: Okay, so we need a new plan."
01:31:47.001,01:31:48.044,FRIDGE: Yeah. MARTHA: Right.
01:31:48.211,01:31:50.421,"ALEX: Totally. -Spencer, any ideas?"
01:31:56.219,01:31:57.595,Now?
01:31:59.847,01:32:01.724,What's going on?
01:32:04.310,01:32:07.605,-What are you talking about? -I can't do this.
01:32:07.772,01:32:10.608,"Okay, who am I kidding? I'm not some adventurer."
01:32:10.775,01:32:13.361,I'm not actually brave.
01:32:13.527,01:32:15.738,"Spencer, I just saw you hanging out of a helicopter."
01:32:15.905,01:32:18.908,It's a lot easier to be brave when you have lives to spare.
01:32:19.075,01:32:20.284,It's a lot harder...
01:32:21.577,01:32:23.663,...when you only have one life.
01:32:24.956,01:32:28.334,"We always only have one life, man."
01:32:29.001,01:32:32.672,Okay? That's-- That's all we get. That's how it works.
01:32:33.881,01:32:36.259,"The question is, is how are you gonna live it?"
01:32:36.425,01:32:38.928,Which guy are you gonna decide to be?
01:32:41.430,01:32:44.517,Did I just quote our principal? What the hell is this game doing to me?
01:32:44.684,01:32:45.726,I gotta get out of here.
01:32:46.310,01:32:47.520,Look.
01:32:47.687,01:32:49.855,"We can do this, man."
01:32:50.982,01:32:52.400,We can do it together.
01:32:56.028,01:32:58.906,-Together. -Together.
01:33:01.117,01:33:02.994,"You're a good friend, Fridge."
01:33:06.664,01:33:08.124,All right.
01:33:09.208,01:33:11.585,Okay. I don't know video games.
01:33:11.752,01:33:14.046,But what I do know is football.
01:33:14.213,01:33:16.799,"Now, those lightning-fast, man-eating cats out there?"
01:33:16.966,01:33:18.217,They're the Defenders.
01:33:18.384,01:33:20.553,Which means that we gotta run one hell of an offense.
01:33:20.720,01:33:21.804,You guys.
01:33:24.807,01:33:27.893,-We gotta go. -All right. Here's what we're gonna do.
01:33:31.147,01:33:35.735,We're gonna fan out and run a play that I call: The Double Reverse Refrigerator.
01:33:35.901,01:33:38.321,"Bethany, you go up the left side."
01:33:38.654,01:33:40.364,I'll go up the right.
01:33:40.531,01:33:43.409,"Alex, you'll draw the defense, so Spencer can go up the middle."
01:33:43.576,01:33:45.161,MARTHA: I'll go with Spencer. FRIDGE: No.
01:33:45.328,01:33:47.288,There's something else we need you to do.
01:33:59.050,01:34:00.259,You guys like to dance?
01:34:17.401,01:34:19.487,Hey! Over here!
01:34:19.653,01:34:21.655,Come and get me!
01:34:46.013,01:34:48.349,No! No.
01:34:49.975,01:34:51.143,Oh!
01:34:59.360,01:35:00.653,-Thanks. -Sure.
01:35:03.781,01:35:05.533,Get to the statue. Go!
01:35:25.761,01:36:05.509,"Oh, no! I-- Ah! Whoa. Whoa."
01:36:37.374,01:36:39.627,"Oh, man. Okay."
01:36:39.793,01:36:41.712,"Stay calm, don't panic."
01:36:41.879,01:36:43.380,Stop!
01:36:48.177,01:36:49.929,It's the elephant and the mouse.
01:36:51.472,01:36:52.932,What's up?
01:36:53.098,01:36:54.892,Mouse Finbar.
01:36:55.059,01:36:57.061,Zoologist.
01:36:57.228,01:36:59.438,Zoologist and....
01:36:59.605,01:37:01.732,And backpack guy.
01:37:21.168,01:37:24.338,Give me the jewel or your friend dies.
01:37:26.215,01:37:27.925,-Don't give it to him! -Quiet!
01:37:28.342,01:37:29.552,Stop!
01:37:34.682,01:37:37.101,"Take me instead, okay?"
01:37:46.235,01:37:47.528,Give me the jewel.
01:37:48.696,01:37:50.030,I can't do that.
01:37:50.364,01:37:51.615,Five...
01:37:52.199,01:37:55.202,"-...four, three... -I can't give you the jewel."
01:37:55.369,01:37:56.579,-Spencer. -...two!
01:37:56.745,01:37:58.581,Because I don't have it!
01:38:06.505,01:38:08.007,"Zoology, bitch!"
01:38:14.722,01:38:16.307,Whoa. Oh.
01:38:19.852,01:38:31.238,"No, no, no! Don't-- Douche bag! You suck!"
01:38:32.156,01:38:33.198,MARTHA: Whoa!
01:38:35.200,01:38:37.328,-Elephant. -Begin the climb.
01:38:40.539,01:38:42.291,ALEX: Leave her alone!
01:38:42.625,01:38:44.209,Get up there. I'll get the jewel to you.
01:38:44.376,01:38:45.794,-Martha. -Trust me.
01:38:45.961,01:38:47.338,-I'll get it to you. Go. -Okay.
01:38:54.678,01:38:56.472,"Go, Martha!"
01:39:04.146,01:39:05.189,-Oh! -Alex!
01:40:05.582,01:40:07.251,I'll take that.
01:40:19.763,01:40:21.181,Game over.
01:40:32.067,01:40:33.527,I don't think so.
01:40:38.657,01:40:39.908,Venom's my weakness.
01:41:09.813,01:41:11.440,"Go, Spencer."
01:41:21.241,01:41:22.576,No.
01:41:34.046,01:41:35.130,BOTH: Yeah! -Yeah.
01:41:48.560,01:41:49.603,Call out its name.
01:41:50.270,01:41:52.856,"-Call out its name! -Call out its name, everyone!"
01:41:53.023,01:41:54.733,-Jumanji! -Jumanji!
01:41:54.900,01:41:58.737,-Jumanji! -Jumanji!
01:42:39.152,01:42:41.154,MARTHA: I think we did it. FRIDGE: I think we won.
01:42:41.321,01:42:42.322,BETHANY: I think we did.
01:42:43.782,01:42:44.950,"Guys, it's Nigel."
01:42:45.117,01:42:46.577,Nigel.
01:42:55.043,01:42:57.087,"Well done, intrepid adventurers."
01:42:57.254,01:42:58.630,You lifted the curse!
01:42:58.797,01:43:00.674,All of Jumanji thanks you.
01:43:00.841,01:43:02.301,Your work here is done.
01:43:02.467,01:43:05.262,"So, sadly, this is where we part."
01:43:05.429,01:43:07.055,Seaplane McDonough...
01:43:07.222,01:43:08.849,...let me shake your hand.
