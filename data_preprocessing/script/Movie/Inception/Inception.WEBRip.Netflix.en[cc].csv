00:02:06.668,00:02:11.172,ARE YOU HERE TO KILL ME?
00:02:17.888,00:02:21.182,I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.
00:02:21.224,00:02:23.852,I'VE SEEN ONE BEFORE...
00:02:25.104,00:02:28.065,"...MANY, MANY YEARS AGO."
00:02:28.107,00:02:33.570,IT BELONGED TO A MAN I MET IN A HALF-REMEMBERED DREAM.
00:02:35.697,00:02:40.661,A MAN POSSESSED OF SOME RADICAL NOTIONS.
00:02:43.831,00:02:46.834,Cobb: WHAT IS THE MOST RESILIENT PARASITE?
00:02:46.875,00:02:49.419,A BACTERIA?
00:02:49.461,00:02:51.588,A VIRUS?
00:02:51.630,00:02:53.256,AN INTESTINAL WORM?
00:02:53.298,00:02:57.845,UH...WHAT MR. COBB IS TRYING TO SAY -- AN IDEA.
00:02:58.846,00:03:00.848,RESILIENT.
00:03:00.889,00:03:05.894,"ONCE AN IDEA HAS TAKEN HOLD OF THE BRAIN, IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ERADICATE."
00:03:05.936,00:03:10.065,"AN IDEA THAT IS FULLY FORMED, FULLY UNDERSTOOD -- THAT STICKS."
00:03:10.107,00:03:12.026,RIGHT IN THERE SOMEWHERE.
00:03:12.067,00:03:13.610,FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU TO STEAL?
00:03:13.652,00:03:14.903,YES.
00:03:13.652,00:03:19.282,"IN THE DREAM STATE, YOUR CONSCIOUS DEFENSES ARE LOWERED, AND THAT MAKES YOUR THOUGHTS VULNERABLE TO THEFT."
00:03:19.324,00:03:20.826,IT'S CALLED EXTRACTION.
00:03:20.868,00:03:27.041,"MR. SAITO, WE CAN TRAIN YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS TO DEFEND ITSELF FROM EVEN THE MOST SKILLED EXTRACTOR."
00:03:27.082,00:03:28.583,HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?
00:03:28.625,00:03:31.086,BECAUSE I AM THE MOST SKILLED EXTRACTOR.
00:03:31.128,00:03:34.006,I KNOW HOW TO SEARCH YOUR MIND AND FIND YOUR SECRETS.
00:03:34.048,00:03:35.215,I KNOW THE TRICKS.
00:03:35.256,00:03:41.096,"AND I CAN TEACH THEM TO YOU, SO THAT EVEN WHEN YOU'RE ASLEEP, YOUR DEFENSE IS NEVER DOWN."
00:03:41.138,00:03:45.851,"LOOK, IF YOU WANT MY HELP, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY OPEN WITH ME."
00:03:45.893,00:03:51.690,"I NEED TO KNOW MY WAY AROUND YOUR THOUGHTS BETTER THAN YOUR WIFE, BETTER THAN YOUR THERAPIST, BETTER THAN ANYONE."
00:03:51.732,00:03:57.404,"IF THIS IS A DREAM, AND YOU HAVE A SAFE FULL OF SECRETS, I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT SAFE."
00:03:57.445,00:04:00.866,"IN ORDER FOR THIS ALL TO WORK, YOU NEED TO COMPLETELY LET ME IN."
00:04:03.284,00:04:08.207,"ENJOY YOUR EVENING, GENTLEMEN, AS I CONSIDER YOUR PROPOSAL."
00:04:09.917,00:04:11.877,HE KNOWS.
00:04:15.296,00:04:16.548,WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE?
00:05:10.727,00:05:13.605,SAITO KNOWS.
00:05:13.647,00:05:15.899,DOESN'T MATTER.
00:05:15.941,00:05:17.859,THE INFORMATION IS IN THE SAFE.
00:05:17.901,00:05:20.320,HE LOOKED RIGHT AT IT WHEN I MENTIONED SECRETS.
00:05:20.361,00:05:22.447,WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?
00:05:24.866,00:05:26.952,JUST HEAD BACK TO THE ROOM.
00:05:26.994,00:05:28.745,ALL RIGHT?
00:05:28.787,00:05:30.455,"OKAY, MAKE SURE YOU DO."
00:05:38.172,00:05:41.216,IF I JUMPED...
00:05:41.258,00:05:43.135,WOULD I SURVIVE?
00:05:45.470,00:05:49.183,"WITH A CLEAN DIVE, PERHAPS."
00:05:49.224,00:05:50.433,"MAL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?"
00:05:50.475,00:05:52.727,I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE MISSING ME.
00:05:52.769,00:05:53.937,YOU KNOW THAT I AM.
00:05:53.979,00:05:56.064,BUT I...
00:05:56.106,00:05:57.983,I CAN'T TRUST YOU ANYMORE.
00:05:58.025,00:06:00.401,SO WHAT?
00:06:00.443,00:06:03.404,LOOKS LIKE ARTHUR'S TASTE.
00:06:03.446,00:06:07.826,"ACTUALLY, THE SUBJECT IS PARTIAL TO POSTWAR BRITISH PAINTERS."
00:06:07.868,00:06:11.038,"PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT."
00:06:18.837,00:06:20.588,TELL ME...
00:06:20.630,00:06:22.216,DO THE CHILDREN MISS ME?
00:06:25.426,00:06:28.263,YOU CAN'T IMAGINE.
00:06:32.391,00:06:33.643,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
00:06:33.685,00:06:35.270,JUST GETTING SOME FRESH AIR.
00:06:35.312,00:06:37.647,"STAY WHERE YOU ARE, MAL."
00:06:50.327,00:06:52.704,COME ON. DAMN IT.
00:07:53.390,00:07:56.268,Saito: TURN AROUND!
00:07:56.310,00:07:57.602,"Mal: THE GUN, DOM."
00:08:06.569,00:08:07.904,PLEASE.
00:08:19.916,00:08:22.794,"NOW THE ENVELOPE, MR. COBB."
00:08:22.836,00:08:26.547,DID SHE TELL YOU?
00:08:26.589,00:08:31.761,THAT YOU'RE HERE TO STEAL FROM ME OR THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY ASLEEP?
00:08:36.057,00:08:38.143,I WANT TO KNOW THE NAME OF YOUR EMPLOYER.
00:08:40.020,00:08:44.316,"UH, THERE'S NO USE THREATENING HIM IN A DREAM, RIGHT, MAL?"
00:08:44.358,00:08:47.444,THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE THREATENING.
00:08:47.486,00:08:50.197,KILLING HIM WOULD JUST WAKE HIM UP.
00:08:50.238,00:08:51.781,BUT PAIN...
00:08:53.492,00:08:55.535,AAH! UGH!
00:08:55.576,00:08:57.912,...PAIN IS IN THE MIND.
00:08:57.954,00:09:01.833,"AND JUDGING BY THE DECOR, WE'RE IN YOUR MIND, AREN'T WE, ARTHUR?"
00:09:13.887,00:09:15.555,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
00:09:15.596,00:09:17.224,I KNOW.
00:09:17.265,00:09:19.351,I'M GONNA TRY TO KEEP SAITO UNDER A LITTLE BIT LONGER.
00:09:19.393,00:09:20.643,WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
00:09:34.366,00:09:36.743,HE WAS CLOSE.
00:09:36.784,00:09:39.079,VERY CLOSE.
00:09:51.841,00:09:53.885,AAH! STOP HIM!
00:10:08.691,00:10:11.652,AAH!
00:10:20.537,00:10:21.662,THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.
00:10:31.339,00:10:32.882,AAH!
00:10:43.310,00:10:44.727,HE WON'T WAKE!
00:10:49.857,00:10:51.359,GIVE HIM THE KICK!
00:10:51.401,00:10:52.693,DUNK HIM.
00:11:28.313,00:11:29.730,AAH.
00:11:33.109,00:11:34.777,NASH!
00:11:36.363,00:11:38.697,HE'S OUT.
00:11:43.620,00:11:46.998,"YOU CAME PREPARED, HMM?"
00:11:47.040,00:11:48.583,NOT EVEN MY HEAD OF SECURITY KNOWS THIS APARTMENT.
00:11:48.625,00:11:50.168,HOW DID YOU FIND IT?
00:11:50.210,00:11:57.342,"IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR A MAN OF YOUR POSITION TO KEEP A LOVE NEST LIKE THIS SECRET, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE'S A MARRIED WOMAN INVOLVED."
00:11:57.384,00:11:59.427,SHE WOULD NEVER.
00:11:59.469,00:12:01.095,WITH A DILEMMA.
00:12:01.137,00:12:02.639,THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER.
00:12:02.681,00:12:03.931,YOU GOT WHAT YOU CAME FOR.
00:12:03.973,00:12:05.559,"WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE."
00:12:05.600,00:12:08.353,"YOU LEFT OUT A KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION, DIDN'T YOU?"
00:12:08.395,00:12:11.814,"YOU HELD SOMETHING BACK, BECAUSE YOU KNEW WHAT WE WERE UP TO."
00:12:11.856,00:12:13.483,"QUESTION IS, WHY'D YOU LET US IN AT ALL?"
00:12:13.525,00:12:14.609,AN AUDITION.
00:12:14.651,00:12:16.986,AN AUDITION FOR WHAT?
00:12:17.028,00:12:19.030,DOESN'T MATTER.
00:12:19.072,00:12:21.866,WE EXTRACTED EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION YOU HAD IN THERE.
00:12:21.908,00:12:24.202,BUT YOUR DECEPTION WAS OBVIOUS.
00:13:05.201,00:13:08.121,"SO, LEAVE ME AND GO."
00:13:08.162,00:13:09.872,"YOU DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND, MR. SAITO."
00:13:09.914,00:13:13.834,"THAT CORPORATION THAT HIRED US, THEY WON'T ACCEPT FAILURE."
00:13:13.876,00:13:16.254,WE WON'T LAST TWO DAYS.
00:13:16.296,00:13:19.299,COBB?
00:13:19.340,00:13:21.426,LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO THIS A LITTLE MORE SIMPLY.
00:13:22.843,00:13:24.887,TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW!
00:13:24.929,00:13:26.765,TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW NOW!
00:13:29.976,00:13:33.271,I HAVE ALWAYS HATED THIS CARPET.
00:13:33.313,00:13:37.692,IT'S STAINED AND FRAYED IN SUCH DISTINCTIVE WAYS.
00:13:37.734,00:13:42.322,BUT VERY DEFINITELY MADE OF WOOL.
00:13:42.363,00:13:45.116,RIGHT NOW...
00:13:45.158,00:13:46.993,I'M LYING ON POLYESTER.
00:13:50.955,00:13:53.667,WHICH MEANS...
00:13:53.708,00:13:57.378,I'M NOT LYING ON MY CARPET IN MY APARTMENT.
00:13:57.420,00:14:01.299,"YOU HAVE LIVED UP TO YOUR REPUTATION, MR. COBB."
00:14:01.341,00:14:03.884,I'M STILL DREAMING.
00:14:10.308,00:14:11.934,HOW'D IT GO?
00:14:16.731,00:14:19.066,DREAM WITHIN A DREAM.
00:14:19.108,00:14:21.902,"AH, I'M IMPRESSED."
00:14:23.112,00:14:25.948,"BUT IN MY DREAM, YOU PLAY BY MY RULES."
00:14:25.990,00:14:29.160,"AH, YES, BUT, YOU SEE, MR. SAITO..."
00:14:29.202,00:14:31.496,WE'RE NOT IN YOUR DREAM.
00:14:37.168,00:14:40.463,AAH!
00:14:41.964,00:14:43.924,ASSHOLE. HOW DO YOU MESS UP THE CARPET?
00:14:43.966,00:14:45.301,IT WASN'T MY FAULT.
00:14:45.343,00:14:46.636,YOU'RE THE ARCHITECT.
00:14:46.678,00:14:48.513,I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GONNA RUB HIS DAMN CHEEK ON IT!
00:14:48.555,00:14:50.390,THAT'S ENOUGH.
00:14:50.431,00:14:52.933,AND YOU. WHAT THE HELL WAS ALL THAT?
00:14:52.975,00:14:54.894,I HAVE IT UNDER CONTROL.
00:14:54.935,00:14:56.396,I'D HATE TO SEE YOU OUT OF CONTROL.
00:14:56.437,00:14:58.773,"ALL RIGHT, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS."
00:14:58.815,00:15:00.316,I'M GETTING OFF AT KYOTO.
00:15:00.358,00:15:02.360,WHY? HE'S NOT GONNA CHECK EVERY COMPARTMENT.
00:15:02.402,00:15:03.820,"WELL, I DON'T LIKE TRAINS."
00:15:03.862,00:15:06.113,LISTEN.
00:16:20.313,00:16:21.856,"YES, HELLO?"
00:16:21.898,00:16:23.441,"PHILLIPA: Hi, Daddy."
00:16:23.483,00:16:25.192,"JAMES: Hi, Dad."
00:16:25.234,00:16:27.487,"HEY, GUYS. HEY."
00:16:27.528,00:16:28.947,"HOW YOU DOIN', HUH?"
00:16:28.988,00:16:30.281,Good.
00:16:30.323,00:16:31.616,"Okay, I guess."
00:16:31.658,00:16:33.868,OKAY?
00:16:33.910,00:16:35.536,WHO'S JUST OKAY?
00:16:35.578,00:16:37.705,Yeah.
00:16:37.747,00:16:39.039,"When are you coming home, Dad?"
00:16:40.750,00:16:43.252,"WELL, I CAN'T, SWEETHEART."
00:16:43.294,00:16:45.087,"NOT FOR A WHILE, REMEMBER?"
00:16:45.129,00:16:46.923,Why?
00:16:46.965,00:16:49.008,"LOOK, I...I TOLD YOU."
00:16:49.049,00:16:52.219,"I'M -- I'M AWAY BECAUSE I'M WORKING, RIGHT?"
00:16:52.261,00:16:56.098,Grandma says you're never coming back.
00:16:56.140,00:16:59.018,"PHILLIPA, IS THAT YOU?"
00:16:59.059,00:17:01.688,"PUT GRANDMA ON THE PHONE FOR ME, WILL YOU?"
00:17:01.729,00:17:03.648,She's shaking her head.
00:17:05.441,00:17:08.277,WE'LL JUST HOPE SHE'S WRONG ABOUT THAT.
00:17:08.319,00:17:10.655,Daddy?
00:17:10.697,00:17:11.990,"YEAH, JAMES?"
00:17:12.031,00:17:13.741,Is Mommy with you?
00:17:16.285,00:17:19.831,"JAMES, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS."
00:17:19.873,00:17:22.500,MOMMY'S NOT HERE ANYMORE.
00:17:22.542,00:17:25.503,Where?
00:17:25.545,00:17:28.756,"GRANDMA: That's enough, kids."
00:17:28.798,00:17:31.300,"LISTEN, I'M -- I'M GONNA SEND SOME PRESENTS WITH GRANDPA."
00:17:31.342,00:17:32.635,ALL RIGHT?
00:17:32.677,00:17:33.928,AND YOU BE GOOD.
00:17:42.269,00:17:44.731,OUR RIDE'S ON THE ROOF.
00:17:44.772,00:17:46.691,RIGHT.
00:17:53.197,00:17:54.574,"HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?"
00:17:54.615,00:17:56.534,YEAH.
00:17:56.576,00:17:59.370,"WELL, DOWN IN THE DREAM, MAL SHOWING UP."
00:17:59.412,00:18:01.121,"LOOK, I'M, UH, SORRY ABOUT YOUR LEG."
00:18:01.163,00:18:02.665,WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
00:18:02.707,00:18:04.291,"IT'S GETTING WORSE, ISN'T IT?"
00:18:04.333,00:18:05.835,"ONE APOLOGY'S ALL YOU'RE GETTING, ALL RIGHT, ARTHUR?"
00:18:05.877,00:18:07.420,WHERE'S NASH?
00:18:07.461,00:18:09.129,HE HASN'T SHOWN.
00:18:09.171,00:18:13.133,"NO, WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DELIVER SAITO'S EXPANSION PLANS TO COBOL ENGINEERING TWO HOURS AGO."
00:18:13.175,00:18:14.719,"BY NOW, THEY KNOW WE FAILED."
00:18:14.761,00:18:17.304,IT'S TIME WE DISAPPEAR.
00:18:17.346,00:18:19.348,WHERE YOU GONNA GO?
00:18:19.390,00:18:23.143,"I CAN LIE LOW THERE, MAYBE SNIFF OUT A JOB WHEN THINGS QUIET DOWN."
00:18:23.185,00:18:25.605,YOU?
00:18:25.646,00:18:27.189,SEND MY REGARDS.
00:18:33.404,00:18:35.114,HE SOLD YOU OUT.
00:18:35.155,00:18:37.408,THOUGHT TO COME TO ME AND BARGAIN FOR HIS LIFE.
00:18:37.450,00:18:41.328,"SO, I OFFER YOU THE SATISFACTION."
00:18:44.624,00:18:47.167,IT'S NOT THE WAY I DEAL WITH THINGS.
00:19:00.180,00:19:01.223,WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH HIM?
00:19:01.265,00:19:03.350,NOTHING.
00:19:03.392,00:19:06.562,BUT I CAN'T SPEAK FOR COBOL ENGINEERING.
00:19:19.993,00:19:21.786,WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US?
00:19:21.828,00:19:23.370,INCEPTION.
00:19:24.580,00:19:26.833,IS IT POSSIBLE?
00:19:26.874,00:19:32.046,"IF YOU CAN STEAL AN IDEA FROM SOMEONE'S MIND, WHY CAN'T YOU PLANT ONE THERE INSTEAD?"
00:19:32.088,00:19:34.007,OKAY. HERE'S ME PLANTING AN IDEA IN YOUR HEAD.
00:19:34.048,00:19:35.967,"I SAY TO YOU, DON'T THINK ABOUT ELEPHANTS."
00:19:36.009,00:19:37.051,WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?
00:19:37.093,00:19:38.845,ELEPHANTS.
00:19:38.886,00:19:40.471,RIGHT.
00:19:38.886,00:19:42.890,"BUT IT'S NOT YOUR IDEA, BECAUSE YOU KNOW I GAVE IT TO YOU."
00:19:42.932,00:19:45.392,THE SUBJECT'S MIND CAN ALWAYS TRACE THE GENESIS OF THE IDEA.
00:19:45.434,00:19:46.644,TRUE INSPIRATION'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FAKE.
00:19:46.686,00:19:47.770,IT'S NOT TRUE.
00:19:50.314,00:19:52.066,CAN YOU DO IT?
00:19:52.108,00:19:53.901,ARE YOU OFFERING ME A CHOICE?
00:19:53.943,00:19:57.279,BECAUSE I CAN FIND MY OWN WAY TO SQUARE THINGS WITH COBOL.
00:19:57.321,00:19:59.281,THEN YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE.
00:19:59.323,00:20:01.117,"AND I CHOOSE TO LEAVE, SIR."
00:20:06.164,00:20:07.665,TELL THE CREW WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.
00:20:12.419,00:20:14.088,"HEY, MR. COBB!"
00:20:16.465,00:20:19.052,HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO HOME?
00:20:19.093,00:20:21.012,TO AMERICA?
00:20:21.054,00:20:23.890,TO YOUR CHILDREN?
00:20:23.931,00:20:27.267,YOU CAN'T FIX THAT!
00:20:27.309,00:20:28.895,JUST LIKE INCEPTION.
00:20:28.936,00:20:30.270,"COBB, COME ON."
00:20:33.524,00:20:35.902,HOW COMPLEX IS THE IDEA?
00:20:35.943,00:20:37.319,SIMPLE ENOUGH.
00:20:37.361,00:20:41.240,NO IDEA IS SIMPLE WHEN YOU NEED TO PLANT IT IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S MIND.
00:20:41.281,00:20:45.078,MY MAIN COMPETITOR IS AN OLD MAN IN POOR HEALTH.
00:20:45.119,00:20:49.331,HIS SON WILL SOON INHERIT CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION.
00:20:49.373,00:20:53.586,I NEED HIM TO DECIDE TO BREAK UP HIS FATHER'S EMPIRE.
00:20:53.627,00:20:55.546,"COBB, WE SHOULD WALK AWAY FROM THIS."
00:20:55.588,00:20:57.924,HOLD ON.
00:20:57.965,00:21:03.387,"IF I WERE TO DO THIS, IF...I EVEN COULD DO IT, I'D NEED A GUARANTEE."
00:21:03.429,00:21:05.890,HOW DO I KNOW YOU CAN DELIVER?
00:21:05.932,00:21:07.892,YOU DON'T.
00:21:07.934,00:21:09.977,BUT I CAN.
00:21:10.019,00:21:14.690,"SO, DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH..."
00:21:14.732,00:21:21.655,"OR BECOME AN OLD MAN, FILLED WITH REGRET, WAITING TO DIE ALONE?"
00:21:24.491,00:21:26.702,"ASSEMBLE YOUR TEAM, MR. COBB."
00:21:26.744,00:21:29.122,AND CHOOSE YOUR PEOPLE MORE WISELY.
00:21:37.379,00:21:39.090,"LOOK, I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO GO HOME."
00:21:41.217,00:21:43.677,THIS CAN'T BE DONE.
00:21:43.719,00:21:47.306,"YES, IT CAN."
00:21:47.347,00:21:49.142,YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
00:21:49.183,00:21:52.186,I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.
00:21:52.228,00:21:54.354,WHO'D YOU DO IT TO?
00:21:58.651,00:22:02.655,WHY ARE WE GOING TO PARIS?
00:22:02.696,00:22:05.365,WE'RE GONNA NEED A NEW ARCHITECT.
00:22:20.380,00:22:24.010,"Cobb: YOU NEVER DID LIKE YOUR OFFICE, DID YOU?"
00:22:25.219,00:22:30.516,NO SPACE TO THINK IN THAT BROOM CUPBOARD.
00:22:30.557,00:22:33.644,IS IT SAFE FOR YOU TO BE HERE?
00:22:33.686,00:22:36.981,EXTRADITION BETWEEN FRANCE AND THE UNITED STATES IS A BUREAUCRATIC NIGHTMARE.
00:22:37.023,00:22:38.440,YOU KNOW THAT.
00:22:38.482,00:22:41.110,I THINK THEY MIGHT FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK IN YOUR CASE.
00:22:41.152,00:22:43.279,"LOOK, I, UH..."
00:22:43.321,00:22:46.949,BROUGHT THESE FOR YOU TO GIVE TO THE KIDS WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE.
00:22:46.991,00:22:52.246,IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN THE OCCASIONAL STUFFED ANIMAL TO CONVINCE THOSE CHILDREN THEY STILL HAVE A FATHER.
00:22:52.288,00:22:54.832,I'M JUST DOING WHAT I KNOW.
00:22:54.874,00:22:57.835,I NEVER TAUGHT YOU TO BE A THIEF.
00:22:57.877,00:22:59.586,"NO, YOU TAUGHT ME TO NAVIGATE PEOPLE'S MINDS."
00:22:59.628,00:23:04.675,"BUT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED, THERE WEREN'T A WHOLE LOT OF LEGITIMATE WAYS FOR ME TO USE THAT SKILL."
00:23:08.929,00:23:11.515,"WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, DOM?"
00:23:11.557,00:23:16.145,I THINK I FOUND A WAY HOME.
00:23:16.187,00:23:19.732,"IT'S A JOB FOR SOME VERY, VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE."
00:23:19.773,00:23:24.904,PEOPLE WHO I BELIEVE CAN FIX MY CHARGES PERMANENTLY.
00:23:24.945,00:23:26.197,BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.
00:23:26.239,00:23:29.658,YOU'RE HERE TO CORRUPT ONE OF MY BRIGHTEST AND BEST.
00:23:29.700,00:23:31.702,YOU KNOW WHAT I'M OFFERING.
00:23:31.744,00:23:33.411,YOU HAVE TO LET THEM DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES.
00:23:33.453,00:23:35.081,MONEY.
00:23:35.122,00:23:36.916,YOU REMEMBER.
00:23:36.957,00:23:45.465,"IT'S THE CHANCE TO BUILD CATHEDRALS, ENTIRE CITIES, THINGS THAT NEVER EXISTED, THINGS THAT COULDN'T EXIST IN THE REAL WORLD."
00:23:45.507,00:23:50.763,"SO, YOU -- YOU WANT ME TO LET SOMEONE ELSE FOLLOW YOU INTO YOUR FANTASY?"
00:23:50.804,00:23:52.265,THEY DON'T ACTUALLY COME INTO THE DREAM.
00:23:52.306,00:23:55.059,THEY JUST -- THEY JUST DESIGN THE LEVELS AND TEACH THEM TO THE DREAMERS.
00:23:55.101,00:23:56.352,THAT'S ALL.
00:23:56.394,00:23:57.435,DESIGN IT YOURSELF.
00:23:59.688,00:24:01.648,MAL WON'T LET ME.
00:24:06.987,00:24:10.866,"COME BACK TO REALITY, DOM."
00:24:10.908,00:24:11.951,PLEASE.
00:24:11.992,00:24:14.036,REALITY.
00:24:14.078,00:24:19.457,"THOSE KIDS, YOUR GRANDCHILDREN, THEY'RE WAITING FOR THEIR FATHER TO COME BACK HOME."
00:24:19.499,00:24:21.085,THAT'S THEIR REALITY.
00:24:21.127,00:24:24.546,"AND THIS JOB, THIS LAST JOB, THAT'S HOW I GET THERE."
00:24:24.588,00:24:28.466,I WOULD NOT BE STANDING HERE IF I KNEW ANY OTHER WAY.
00:24:30.761,00:24:34.556,I NEED AN ARCHITECT WHO IS AS GOOD AS I WAS.
00:24:38.102,00:24:40.229,I'VE GOT SOMEBODY BETTER.
00:24:40.271,00:24:41.772,Miles: ARIADNE?
00:24:43.941,00:24:46.652,I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MR. COBB.
00:24:46.693,00:24:48.279,PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
00:24:48.321,00:24:53.200,"IF YOU HAVE A FEW MOMENTS, MR. COBB HAS A JOB OFFER HE'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU."
00:24:53.242,00:24:54.701,A WORK PLACEMENT?
00:24:54.743,00:24:56.245,NOT EXACTLY.
00:24:56.287,00:24:58.247,I HAVE A TEST FOR YOU.
00:24:58.289,00:25:00.958,YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FIRST?
00:25:01.000,00:25:04.711,"BEFORE I DESCRIBE THE JOB, I HAVE TO KNOW YOU CAN DO IT."
00:25:04.753,00:25:06.588,"IT'S NOT, STRICTLY SPEAKING, LEGAL."
00:25:09.925,00:25:14.596,YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES TO DESIGN A MAZE THAT IT TAKES ONE MINUTE TO SOLVE.
00:25:15.848,00:25:16.932,STOP.
00:25:20.144,00:25:21.312,AGAIN.
00:25:22.729,00:25:24.023,STOP.
00:25:27.360,00:25:30.154,YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.
00:25:42.458,00:25:44.210,THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.
00:26:03.645,00:26:07.649,Cobb: THEY SAY WE ONLY USE A FRACTION OF OUR BRAIN'S TRUE POTENTIAL.
00:26:07.691,00:26:09.443,"NOW, THAT'S WHEN WE'RE AWAKE."
00:26:09.485,00:26:12.029,"WHEN WE'RE ASLEEP, OUR MIND CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING."
00:26:12.071,00:26:14.031,SUCH AS?
00:26:14.073,00:26:15.824,"WELL, IMAGINE YOU'RE DESIGNING A BUILDING, ALL RIGHT?"
00:26:15.866,00:26:18.077,YOU CONSCIOUSLY CREATE EACH ASPECT.
00:26:18.118,00:26:22.039,"BUT SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE IT'S ALMOST CREATING ITSELF, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN."
00:26:22.081,00:26:23.999,"YEAH. YEAH, LIKE I'M...DISCOVERING IT."
00:26:24.041,00:26:26.377,"GENUINE INSPIRATION, RIGHT?"
00:26:26.419,00:26:30.256,"NOW, IN A DREAM, OUR MIND CONTINUOUSLY DOES THIS."
00:26:30.297,00:26:35.677,WE CREATE AND PERCEIVE OUR WORLD SIMULTANEOUSLY.
00:26:35.719,00:26:38.847,AND OUR MIND DOES THIS SO WELL THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S HAPPENING.
00:26:38.889,00:26:41.100,THAT ALLOWS US TO GET RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT PROCESS.
00:26:41.141,00:26:42.435,HOW?
00:26:42.476,00:26:44.019,BY TAKING OVER THE CREATING PART.
00:26:44.061,00:26:45.687,"NOW, THIS IS WHERE I NEED YOU."
00:26:45.729,00:26:47.814,YOU CREATE THE WORLD OF THE DREAM.
00:26:47.856,00:26:53.820,"WE BRING THE SUBJECT INTO THAT DREAM, AND THEY FILL IT WITH THEIR SUBCONSCIOUS."
00:26:53.862,00:26:59.326,HOW COULD I EVER ACQUIRE ENOUGH DETAIL TO MAKE THEM THINK THAT IT'S REALITY?
00:26:59.368,00:27:02.037,"WELL, DREAMS, THEY FEEL REAL WHILE WE'RE IN THEM, RIGHT?"
00:27:02.079,00:27:05.999,IT'S ONLY WHEN WE WAKE UP THAT WE REALIZE SOMETHING WAS ACTUALLY STRANGE.
00:27:06.041,00:27:07.918,LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
00:27:07.960,00:27:12.506,"YOU -- YOU NEVER REALLY REMEMBER THE BEGINNING OF A DREAM, DO YOU?"
00:27:12.548,00:27:15.342,YOU ALWAYS WIND UP RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT'S GOING ON.
00:27:15.384,00:27:16.802,"I GUESS, YEAH."
00:27:16.843,00:27:18.678,"SO, HOW DID WE END UP HERE?"
00:27:18.720,00:27:21.890,"WELL, WE JUST CAME FROM THE..."
00:27:21.932,00:27:24.602,"THINK ABOUT IT, ARIADNE."
00:27:24.642,00:27:26.353,WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?
00:27:29.856,00:27:31.775,WE'RE DREAMING?
00:27:31.817,00:27:34.652,"YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORKSHOP RIGHT NOW, SLEEPING."
00:27:34.694,00:27:36.489,THIS IS YOUR FIRST LESSON IN SHARED DREAMING.
00:27:36.530,00:27:38.949,STAY CALM.
00:28:14.734,00:28:20.282,"IF IT'S JUST A DREAM, THEN WHY ARE YOU PROTEC-- BECAUSE IT'S NEVER JUST A DREAM, IS IT?"
00:28:20.324,00:28:22.368,AND A FACE FULL OF GLASS HURTS LIKE HELL.
00:28:22.409,00:28:23.701,"WHEN YOU'RE IN IT, IT FEELS REAL."
00:28:23.743,00:28:25.454,THAT'S WHY THE MILITARY DEVELOPED DREAM SHARING.
00:28:25.496,00:28:30.834,IT WAS A TRAINING PROGRAM FOR SOLDIERS TO SHOOT AND STAB AND STRANGLE EACH OTHER AND THEN WAKE UP.
00:28:30.876,00:28:33.379,HOW DID ARCHITECTS BECOME INVOLVED?
00:28:33.420,00:28:36.756,"WELL, SOMEONE HAD TO DESIGN THE DREAMS, RIGHT?"
00:28:36.798,00:28:39.843,WHY DON'T YOU GIVE US ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES?
00:28:39.885,00:28:41.387,FIVE MINUTES?!
00:28:41.428,00:28:44.806,WHAT -- WE WERE TALKING FOR LIKE AT LEAST AN HOUR.
00:28:44.848,00:28:47.017,"IN A DREAM, YOUR MIND FUNCTIONS MORE QUICKLY."
00:28:47.059,00:28:50.937,"THEREFORE, TIME SEEMS TO FEEL MORE SLOW."
00:28:50.979,00:28:52.939,FIVE MINUTES IN THE REAL WORLD GIVES YOU AN HOUR IN THE DREAM.
00:28:54.400,00:28:57.194,WHY DON'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU CAN GET UP TO IN FIVE MINUTES?
00:29:03.075,00:29:04.577,Cobb: YOU'VE GOT THE BASIC LAYOUT.
00:29:04.618,00:29:06.328,"THE BOOKSTORE, THE CAFÉ."
00:29:06.370,00:29:07.954,"ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE IS HERE, TOO."
00:29:07.996,00:29:09.248,Ariadne: WHO ARE THE PEOPLE?
00:29:09.289,00:29:11.166,PROJECTIONS OF MY SUBCONSCIOUS.
00:29:11.208,00:29:13.210,YOURS?
00:29:13.252,00:29:15.462,"REMEMBER, YOU ARE THE DREAMER."
00:29:15.504,00:29:18.048,I AM THE SUBJECT.
00:29:18.090,00:29:20.050,YOU CAN LITERALLY TALK TO MY SUBCONSCIOUS.
00:29:20.092,00:29:23.262,THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS WE EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM THE SUBJECT.
00:29:23.303,00:29:24.597,HOW ELSE DO YOU DO IT?
00:29:24.638,00:29:29.101,BY CREATING SOMETHING SECURE LIKE A -- LIKE A BANK VAULT OR A JAIL.
00:29:29.142,00:29:32.438,THE MIND AUTOMATICALLY FILLS IT WITH INFORMATION IT'S TRYING TO PROTECT.
00:29:32.479,00:29:34.022,YOU UNDERSTAND?
00:29:34.064,00:29:35.482,THEN YOU BREAK IN AND STEAL IT.
00:29:35.524,00:29:37.025,WELL...
00:29:37.067,00:29:43.782,"I GUESS I THOUGHT THAT THE DREAM SPACE WOULD BE ALL ABOUT THE VISUAL, BUT IT'S MORE ABOUT THE FEEL OF IT."
00:29:43.823,00:29:49.079,"MY QUESTION IS, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START MESSING WITH THE PHYSICS OF IT ALL?"
00:30:28.118,00:30:31.037,"IT'S SOMETHING, ISN'T IT?"
00:30:31.079,00:30:33.248,"YES, IT IS."
00:30:56.980,00:30:59.107,Ariadne: WHY ARE THEY ALL LOOKING AT ME?
00:30:59.149,00:31:02.695,BECAUSE MY SUBCONSCIOUS FEELS THAT SOMEONE ELSE IS CREATING THIS WORLD.
00:31:02.736,00:31:06.532,"THE MORE YOU CHANGE THINGS, THE QUICKER THE PROJECTIONS START TO CONVERGE ON YOU."
00:31:06.573,00:31:08.367,CONVERGE?
00:31:08.408,00:31:10.703,THEY SENSE THE FOREIGN NATURE OF THE DREAMER.
00:31:10.744,00:31:13.664,THEY ATTACK LIKE WHITE BLOOD CELLS FIGHTING AN INFECTION.
00:31:13.706,00:31:14.832,LIKE THEY'RE GONNA ATTACK US?
00:31:14.873,00:31:16.124,"NO, NO."
00:31:16.166,00:31:18.293,JUST YOU.
00:31:22.172,00:31:25.676,"THIS IS GREAT, BUT I'M TELLING YOU, IF YOU KEEP CHANGING THINGS LIKE THIS..."
00:31:29.513,00:31:31.181,GEEZ.
00:31:31.223,00:31:33.392,MIND TELLING YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS TO TAKE IT EASY?
00:31:33.433,00:31:35.894,IT'S MY SUBCONSCIOUS.
00:32:29.197,00:32:30.866,VERY IMPRESSIVE.
00:32:42.001,00:32:46.590,I KNOW THIS BRIDGE.
00:32:46.632,00:32:48.967,"YEAH, I CROSS IT EVERY DAY TO GET TO THE COLLEGE."
00:32:49.008,00:32:50.761,NEVER RE-CREATE PLACES FROM YOUR MEMORY.
00:32:50.803,00:32:52.679,ALWAYS IMAGINE NEW PLACES.
00:32:52.721,00:32:54.681,"WELL, YOU GOTTA DRAW FROM STUFF YOU KNOW, RIGHT?"
00:32:54.723,00:32:57.601,ONLY USE DETAILS -- A-A STREETLAMP OR A PHONE BOOTH.
00:32:57.643,00:32:58.644,NEVER ENTIRE AREAS.
00:32:58.685,00:33:00.270,WHY NOT?
00:33:00.312,00:33:04.817,'CAUSE BUILDING A DREAM FROM YOUR MEMORY IS THE EASIEST WAY TO LOSE YOUR GRASP ON WHAT'S REAL AND WHAT IS A DREAM.
00:33:04.858,00:33:05.859,IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
00:33:05.901,00:33:07.486,"HEY, LISTEN TO ME."
00:33:07.527,00:33:09.404,"THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME, YOU UNDERSTAND?"
00:33:09.446,00:33:11.281,IS THAT WHY YOU NEED ME TO BUILD YOUR DREAMS?
00:33:11.323,00:33:13.366,"HEY, GET OFF OF HER."
00:33:13.408,00:33:15.201,COBB! COBB!
00:33:15.243,00:33:16.453,GET OFF OF HER!
00:33:16.495,00:33:17.788,MAL!
00:33:17.830,00:33:18.956,MAL!
00:33:18.997,00:33:20.582,WAKE ME UP!
00:33:20.624,00:33:22.501,WAKE ME UP!
00:33:22.542,00:33:24.085,WAKE ME UP!
00:33:25.838,00:33:27.840,HEY. HEY.
00:33:27.881,00:33:29.508,YOU'RE OKAY.
00:33:31.384,00:33:33.094,WHY WOULDN'T I WAKE UP?
00:33:33.136,00:33:37.850,"'CAUSE THERE WAS STILL SOME TIME ON THE CLOCK, AND YOU CAN'T WAKE UP FROM WITHIN THE DREAM UNLESS YOU DIE."
00:33:37.891,00:33:39.726,SHE'LL NEED A TOTEM.
00:33:39.768,00:33:41.687,"A TOTEM, IT'S A SMALL PERSONAL..."
00:33:41.728,00:33:44.022,"THAT'S SOME SUBCONSCIOUS YOU'VE GOT ON YOU, COBB!"
00:33:44.063,00:33:45.524,SHE'S A REAL CHARMER!
00:33:45.565,00:33:47.192,OH. I SEE YOU MET MRS. COBB.
00:33:47.233,00:33:48.944,SHE'S HIS WIFE?
00:33:48.986,00:33:50.445,"SO, A TOTEM."
00:33:50.487,00:33:56.159,"YOU NEED A SMALL OBJECT, POTENTIALLY HEAVY, SOMETHING YOU CAN HAVE ON YOU ALL THE TIME THAT NO ONE ELSE KNOWS."
00:33:56.201,00:33:58.161,NO. IT NEEDS TO BE MORE UNIQUE THAN THAT.
00:33:58.203,00:34:01.456,"LIKE, THIS IS A..."
00:34:02.916,00:34:04.292,I CAN'T LET YOU TOUCH IT.
00:34:04.334,00:34:05.961,THAT WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSE.
00:34:06.003,00:34:09.923,"SEE, ONLY I KNOW THE BALANCE AND THE WEIGHT OF THIS PARTICULAR LOADED DIE."
00:34:09.965,00:34:15.512,"THAT WAY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR TOTEM, YOU KNOW BEYOND A DOUBT THAT YOU'RE NOT IN SOMEONE ELSE'S DREAM."
00:34:18.640,00:34:26.439,"I-I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT'S GOING ON, OR IF YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO, BUT COBB HAS SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT HE'S TRIED TO BURY DOWN THERE."
00:34:26.481,00:34:30.360,AND I'M NOT ABOUT TO JUST OPEN MY MIND TO SOMEONE LIKE THAT.
00:34:35.365,00:34:37.910,Cobb: SHE'LL BE BACK.
00:34:37.951,00:34:40.370,I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE PICK IT UP THAT QUICKLY BEFORE.
00:34:40.412,00:34:48.127,"REALITY'S NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH FOR HER NOW, AND WHEN SHE COMES BACK WHEN SHE COMES BACK, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE HER BUILDING MAZES."
00:34:48.169,00:34:49.713,WHERE ARE YOU GONNA BE?
00:34:49.755,00:34:51.548,I GOTTA GO VISIT EAMES.
00:34:51.590,00:34:53.842,"EAMES? NO, HE'S IN MOMBASA."
00:34:53.884,00:34:55.761,IT'S A NECESSARY RISK.
00:34:55.802,00:34:57.387,"WELL, THERE'S PLENTY OF GOOD THIEVES."
00:34:57.429,00:35:00.057,WE DON'T JUST NEED A THIEF.
00:35:00.098,00:35:01.182,WE NEED A FORGER.
00:35:09.608,00:35:12.903,"YOU CAN RUB THEM TOGETHER ALL YOU WANT, THEY'RE NOT GONNA BREED."
00:35:12.945,00:35:14.320,YOU NEVER KNOW.
00:35:15.655,00:35:18.199,LET ME GET YOU A DRINK.
00:35:18.241,00:35:20.702,YOU'RE BUYING.
00:35:26.792,00:35:28.085,YOUR SPELLING HASN'T IMPROVED.
00:35:28.126,00:35:29.502,PISS OFF.
00:35:29.544,00:35:30.879,HOW'S YOUR HANDWRITING?
00:35:30.921,00:35:32.505,IT'S VERSATILE.
00:35:32.547,00:35:33.840,GOOD.
00:35:33.882,00:35:35.133,THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:35:35.174,00:35:36.760,INCEPTION.
00:35:36.802,00:35:43.100,"NOW, BEFORE YOU BOTHER TELLING ME IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, LET ME -- NO, IT'S PERFECTLY POSSIBLE."
00:35:43.141,00:35:45.268,INTERESTING.
00:35:45.310,00:35:47.145,'CAUSE ARTHUR KEEPS TELLING ME IT CAN'T BE DONE.
00:35:47.186,00:35:48.939,HMM. ARTHUR.
00:35:48.981,00:35:50.356,YOU STILL WORKING WITH THAT STICK IN THE MUD?
00:35:50.398,00:35:51.900,"WELL, HE IS GOOD AT WHAT HE DOES, RIGHT?"
00:35:51.942,00:35:53.526,"OH, HE'S THE BEST."
00:35:53.568,00:35:56.029,HE HAS NO IMAGINATION.
00:35:56.071,00:35:59.407,"LISTEN, IF YOU'RE GONNA PERFORM INCEPTION, YOU NEED IMAGINATION."
00:35:59.449,00:36:01.326,LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
00:36:01.367,00:36:03.161,HAVE YOU DONE IT BEFORE?
00:36:03.202,00:36:04.830,WE TRIED IT.
00:36:04.871,00:36:06.623,"WE GOT THE IDEA IN PLACE, BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE."
00:36:06.665,00:36:08.207,YOU DIDN'T PLANT IT DEEP ENOUGH?
00:36:08.249,00:36:09.835,"NO, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DEPTH."
00:36:09.876,00:36:14.422,YOU NEED THE SIMPLEST VERSION OF THE IDEA IN ORDER FOR IT TO GROW NATURALLY IN YOUR SUBJECT'S MIND.
00:36:14.464,00:36:16.257,IT'S A VERY SUBTLE ART.
00:36:16.299,00:36:19.011,"SO, WHAT IS THIS IDEA THAT YOU NEED TO PLANT?"
00:36:19.052,00:36:22.931,WE NEED THE HEIR OF A MAJOR CORPORATION TO DISSOLVE HIS FATHER'S EMPIRE.
00:36:22.973,00:36:27.268,"WELL, YOU SEE, RIGHT THERE, YOU HAVE VARIOUS POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS AND ANTI-MONOPOLISTIC SENTIMENTS AND SO FORTH."
00:36:27.310,00:36:29.437,BUT ALL OF THAT STUFF IS...
00:36:29.479,00:36:32.398,"IT'S REALLY AT THE MERCY OF YOUR SUBJECT'S PREJUDICE, YOU SEE?"
00:36:32.440,00:36:35.443,AND WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS START AT THE ABSOLUTE BASIC.
00:36:35.485,00:36:36.361,WHICH IS WHAT?
00:36:37.654,00:36:38.989,THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FATHER.
00:36:41.491,00:36:44.285,DO YOU HAVE A CHEMIST?
00:36:44.327,00:36:47.122,"RIGHT. OKAY, WELL, THERE'S A MAN HERE. YUSUF."
00:36:47.164,00:36:50.500,"HE, UH, HE FORMULATES HIS OWN VERSIONS OF THE COMPOUNDS."
00:36:50.542,00:36:52.627,WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ME THERE?
00:36:52.669,00:36:55.172,ONCE YOU'VE LOST YOUR TAIL.
00:36:55.213,00:36:56.923,COBOL ENGINEERING.
00:36:56.965,00:36:59.551,THAT PRICE ON MY HEAD -- WAS THAT DEAD OR ALIVE?
00:36:59.592,00:37:01.678,DON'T REMEMBER. LET'S SEE IF HE STARTS SHOOTING.
00:37:01.720,00:37:03.471,RUN INTERFERENCE.
00:37:03.513,00:37:05.640,"I'LL MEET YOU DOWNSTAIRS IN THE BAR IN, SAY, HALF AN HOUR?"
00:37:05.682,00:37:07.893,THEN BACK HERE?
00:37:09.895,00:37:12.022,ALL RIGHT.
00:37:12.064,00:37:15.025,FREDDY! FREDDY SIMMONDS.
00:37:15.067,00:37:16.484,"MY GOD, IT'S YOU, ISN'T IT?"
00:37:17.986,00:37:19.445,WHO?
00:37:19.487,00:37:21.865,"NO, IT ISN'T YOU."
00:37:21.907,00:37:23.282,"YOU'RE NOT DREAMING NOW, ARE YOU?"
00:37:37.881,00:37:39.716,OHH!
00:37:41.760,00:37:43.053,THERE!
00:38:02.155,00:38:04.199,CAFÉ. ONE CAFÉ.
00:38:08.828,00:38:10.080,Shh!
00:38:15.919,00:38:18.755,ONE CAFÉ.
00:38:18.797,00:38:20.548,CAFÉ.
00:38:41.153,00:38:42.403,OHH!
00:39:15.394,00:39:16.604,"CARE FOR A LIFT, MR. COBB?"
00:39:16.646,00:39:19.732,WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MOMBASA?!
00:39:19.774,00:39:22.235,I'M HERE TO PROTECT MY INVESTMENT.
00:39:24.904,00:39:27.532,"AH, SO THIS IS YOUR IDEA OF LOSING A TAIL, HUH?"
00:39:27.573,00:39:28.574,DIFFERENT TAIL.
00:39:36.791,00:39:39.669,COBB SAID YOU'D BE BACK.
00:39:39.711,00:39:42.172,"YEAH, WELL, I TRIED NOT TO COME, BUT..."
00:39:42.214,00:39:43.673,BUT THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE IT.
00:39:43.715,00:39:44.799,IT'S JUST...
00:39:46.885,00:39:49.888,...PURE CREATION.
00:39:49.929,00:39:52.015,SHALL WE TAKE A LOOK AT SOME PARADOXICAL ARCHITECTURE?
00:39:52.057,00:39:55.101,YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MASTER A FEW TRICKS IF YOU'RE GONNA BUILD THREE COMPLETE DREAM LEVELS.
00:39:55.143,00:39:56.853,EXCUSE ME.
00:39:56.895,00:39:59.731,WHAT KIND OF TRICKS?
00:39:59.772,00:40:02.567,"IN A DREAM, YOU CAN CHEAT ARCHITECTURE INTO IMPOSSIBLE SHAPES."
00:40:02.608,00:40:07.239,"THAT LETS YOU CREATE CLOSED LOOPS, LIKE THE PENROSE STEPS."
00:40:07.280,00:40:08.698,THE INFINITE STAIRCASE.
00:40:11.492,00:40:13.245,SEE?
00:40:17.082,00:40:19.000,PARADOX.
00:40:19.042,00:40:24.463,"SO, A CLOSED LOOP LIKE THAT WILL HELP YOU DISGUISE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE DREAM YOU CREATE."
00:40:24.505,00:40:26.049,BUT HOW BIG DO THESE LEVELS HAVE TO BE?
00:40:26.091,00:40:29.719,"WELL, IT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM THE FLOOR OF A BUILDING TO AN ENTIRE CITY."
00:40:29.761,00:40:32.680,BUT THEY HAVE TO BE COMPLICATED ENOUGH THAT WE CAN HIDE FROM THE PROJECTIONS.
00:40:32.722,00:40:34.099,A MAZE.
00:40:34.140,00:40:35.850,AND THE BETTER THE MAZE...
00:40:35.892,00:40:38.311,THEN THE LONGER WE HAVE BEFORE THE PROJECTIONS CATCH US?
00:40:38.353,00:40:39.854,EXACTLY.
00:40:39.896,00:40:42.523,MY SUBCONSCIOUS SEEMS POLITE ENOUGH.
00:40:42.565,00:40:43.816,THEY'LL TURN UGLY.
00:40:43.858,00:40:46.945,NO ONE LIKES TO FEEL SOMEONE ELSE MESSING AROUND IN THEIR MIND.
00:40:46.986,00:40:50.573,"COBB CAN'T BUILD ANYMORE, CAN HE?"
00:40:50.615,00:40:53.701,"WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN'T, BUT HE WON'T."
00:40:53.743,00:40:56.079,HE THINKS IT'S SAFER IF HE DOESN'T KNOW THE LAYOUTS.
00:40:56.121,00:40:57.830,WHY?
00:40:57.872,00:40:59.749,BUT I THINK IT'S MAL.
00:40:59.791,00:41:01.293,HIS EX-WIFE?
00:41:01.334,00:41:02.335,"NO, NOT HIS EX."
00:41:02.377,00:41:03.920,THEY'RE STILL TOGETHER?
00:41:03.962,00:41:06.672,NO...
00:41:06.714,00:41:07.840,SHE'S DEAD.
00:41:10.509,00:41:12.470,WHAT YOU SEE IN THERE IS JUST HIS PROJECTION OF HER.
00:41:15.807,00:41:18.310,WHAT WAS SHE LIKE IN REAL LIFE?
00:41:18.351,00:41:20.270,SHE WAS LOVELY.
00:41:23.564,00:41:26.692,Yusuf: YOU ARE SEEKING A CHEMIST?
00:41:26.734,00:41:28.778,TO FORMULATE COMPOUNDS FOR A JOB?
00:41:28.820,00:41:31.489,AND TO GO INTO THE FIELD WITH US.
00:41:31.530,00:41:34.200,"NO, I RARELY GO INTO THE FIELD, MR. COBB."
00:41:34.242,00:41:37.578,"WELL, WE'D NEED YOU THERE TO TAILOR COMPOUNDS SPECIFIC TO OUR NEEDS."
00:41:37.620,00:41:39.914,WHICH ARE?
00:41:39.956,00:41:43.168,A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM.
00:41:45.128,00:41:47.213,THREE.
00:41:47.255,00:41:48.923,NOT POSSIBLE.
00:41:48.965,00:41:50.383,THAT MANY DREAMS WITHIN DREAMS IS TOO UNSTABLE.
00:41:50.425,00:41:52.802,IT IS POSSIBLE.
00:41:52.844,00:41:55.096,YOU JUST HAVE TO ADD A SEDATIVE.
00:41:55.138,00:41:57.556,A POWERFUL SEDATIVE.
00:41:58.850,00:42:00.977,HOW MANY TEAM MEMBERS?
00:42:01.019,00:42:02.728,FIVE.
00:42:02.770,00:42:09.652,THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW YOU'VE DONE THE JOB IS IF I GO IN WITH YOU.
00:42:09.694,00:42:11.988,"THERE'S NO ROOM FOR TOURISTS ON A JOB LIKE THIS, MR. SAITO."
00:42:12.030,00:42:14.657,"THIS TIME, IT SEEMS THERE IS."
00:42:14.699,00:42:17.576,"THIS, I THINK, IS A GOOD PLACE TO START."
00:42:17.618,00:42:19.204,I USE IT EVERY DAY.
00:42:19.245,00:42:20.372,WHAT FOR?
00:42:20.413,00:42:23.124,"HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU."
00:42:24.959,00:42:27.379,PERHAPS YOU WILL NOT WANT TO SEE.
00:42:29.881,00:42:31.007,AFTER YOU.
00:42:39.807,00:42:42.810,Eames: 10...12.
00:42:42.852,00:42:44.603,ALL CONNECTED.
00:42:44.645,00:42:46.064,THEY COME EVERY DAY TO SHARE THE DREAM.
00:42:49.275,00:42:51.610,YOU SEE?
00:42:56.866,00:42:58.993,HOW LONG DO THEY DREAM FOR?
00:42:59.035,00:43:01.204,"Yusuf: THREE, FOUR HOURS, EACH DAY."
00:43:01.246,00:43:02.997,AND DREAM TIME?
00:43:03.039,00:43:04.874,WITH THIS COMPOUND?
00:43:04.916,00:43:06.792,"ABOUT 40 HOURS, EACH AND EVERY DAY."
00:43:06.834,00:43:09.045,WHY DO THEY DO IT?
00:43:09.087,00:43:11.130,"TELL HIM, MR. COBB."
00:43:11.172,00:43:14.384,"AFTER A WHILE, IT BECOMES THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DREAM."
00:43:14.426,00:43:16.469,"DO YOU STILL DREAM, MR. COBB?"
00:43:16.511,00:43:18.804,THEY COME HERE EVERY DAY TO SLEEP?
00:43:18.846,00:43:21.099,Elderly man: NO.
00:43:21.140,00:43:24.810,THEY COME TO BE WOKEN UP.
00:43:24.852,00:43:29.107,THE DREAM HAS BECOME THEIR REALITY.
00:43:29.148,00:43:32.360,"WHO ARE YOU TO SAY OTHERWISE, SIR?"
00:43:34.737,00:43:36.197,LET'S SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO.
00:43:47.292,00:43:50.044,YOU KNOW HOW TO FIND ME.
00:43:51.546,00:43:53.465,YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
00:43:57.885,00:43:59.845,"SHARP, NO?"
00:44:15.320,00:44:18.114,"Saito: ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MR. COBB?"
00:44:18.156,00:44:20.699,YEAH. YEAH.
00:44:20.741,00:44:22.452,EVERYTHING'S JUST FINE.
00:44:30.293,00:44:34.922,"ROBERT FISCHER, HEIR TO THE FISCHER MORROW ENERGY CONGLOMERATE."
00:44:34.964,00:44:36.757,WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM WITH THIS MR. FISCHER?
00:44:36.799,00:44:38.468,THAT'S NOT YOUR CONCERN.
00:44:40.553,00:44:43.473,THIS ISN'T YOUR TYPICAL CORPORATE ESPIONAGE.
00:44:43.515,00:44:45.308,YOU ASKED ME FOR INCEPTION.
00:44:45.350,00:44:48.561,I DO HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THAT REQUEST.
00:44:48.603,00:44:52.773,"NOW, THE SEED THAT WE PLANT IN THIS MAN'S MIND WILL GROW INTO AN IDEA."
00:44:52.815,00:44:54.775,THIS IDEA WILL DEFINE HIM.
00:44:54.817,00:44:56.902,IT MAY COME TO CHANGE...
00:44:56.944,00:44:59.364,"WELL, IT MAY COME TO CHANGE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM."
00:44:59.405,00:45:03.993,WE'RE THE LAST COMPANY STANDING BETWEEN THEM AND TOTAL ENERGY DOMINANCE.
00:45:04.035,00:45:06.829,AND WE CAN NO LONGER COMPETE.
00:45:06.871,00:45:09.832,"SOON, THEY'LL CONTROL THE ENERGY SUPPLY OF HALF THE WORLD."
00:45:09.874,00:45:11.501,"IN EFFECT, THEY BECOME A NEW SUPERPOWER."
00:45:13.586,00:45:16.713,THE WORLD NEEDS ROBERT FISCHER TO CHANGE HIS MIND.
00:45:16.755,00:45:18.841,Eames: THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN.
00:45:18.883,00:45:22.136,HOW IS ROBERT FISCHER'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER?
00:45:22.178,00:45:25.264,RUMOR IS THE RELATIONSHIP IS QUITE COMPLICATED.
00:45:25.306,00:45:27.850,"WELL, WE CAN'T WORK BASED SOLELY ON RUMOR, CAN WE?"
00:45:27.892,00:45:29.726,CAN YOU GET ME ACCESS TO THIS MAN HERE?
00:45:29.768,00:45:31.103,BROWNING.
00:45:31.145,00:45:33.814,FISCHER SENIOR'S RIGHT-HAND MAN...
00:45:33.856,00:45:35.525,FISCHER JUNIOR'S GODFATHER.
00:45:35.567,00:45:39.028,"IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE, IF YOU CAN GET THE RIGHT REFERENCES."
00:45:39.070,00:45:43.575,"REFERENCES ARE SOMETHING OF A SPECIALTY FOR ME, MR. SAITO."
00:45:43.616,00:45:46.327,I'M NOT SMELLING SETTLEMENT HERE.
00:45:46.369,00:45:48.079,TAKE THEM DOWN.
00:45:48.120,00:45:51.874,"MR. BROWNING, MAURICE FISCHER'S POLICY IS ALWAYS ONE OF AVOIDING LITIGATION."
00:45:54.502,00:45:59.382,"WELL, SHALL WE VOICE YOUR CONCERNS WITH MAURICE DIRECTLY?"
00:45:59.424,00:46:00.925,I'M NOT SURE THAT'S NECESSARY.
00:46:00.966,00:46:03.261,"NO, NO, NO."
00:46:24.449,00:46:27.034,HOW IS HE?
00:46:27.076,00:46:33.708,"I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER HIM UNNECESSARILY, BUT -- ROBERT, I TOLD YOU KEEP OUT THE DAMN..."
00:46:34.833,00:46:37.086,"WAIT, SO DO IT! GET -- Nurse: Shh."
00:46:37.128,00:46:38.837,PUT IT THROUGH!
00:46:38.879,00:46:40.965,NEVER! NEVER.
00:46:41.006,00:46:43.217,"HAVEN'T YOU, THE SAME AS I ASKED."
00:46:43.259,00:46:45.762,LEAVE THAT.
00:46:53.978,00:46:55.854,Browning: MUST BE A CHERISHED MEMORY OF HIS.
00:46:55.896,00:46:59.275,I PUT IT BESIDE HIS BED.
00:46:59.317,00:47:01.402,HE HASN'T EVEN NOTICED.
00:47:01.444,00:47:03.321,ROBERT...
00:47:05.197,00:47:07.950,...WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT A POWER OF ATTORNEY.
00:47:07.992,00:47:10.244,"I KNOW THIS IS HARD ON YOU -- NOT NOW, UNCLE PETER."
00:47:10.286,00:47:12.079,BUT IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE START TO...
00:47:14.957,00:47:17.126,Eames: THE VULTURES ARE CIRCLING.
00:47:17.168,00:47:22.256,"AND THE SICKER MAURICE FISCHER BECOMES, THE MORE POWERFUL PETER BROWNING BECOMES."
00:47:22.298,00:47:29.681,"I'VE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE BROWNING, ADOPT HIS PHYSICAL PRESENCE, STUDY HIS MANNERISMS, AND SO ON AND SO FORTH."
00:47:29.722,00:47:37.271,"SO NOW IN THE FIRST LAYER OF THE DREAM, I CAN IMPERSONATE BROWNING AND SUGGEST CONCEPTS TO FISCHER'S CONSCIOUS MIND."
00:47:37.313,00:47:42.859,"THEN, WHEN WE TAKE HIM A LEVEL DEEPER, HIS OWN PROJECTION OF BROWNING SHOULD -- SHOULD FEED THAT RIGHT BACK TO HIM."
00:47:42.901,00:47:44.696,SO HE GIVES HIMSELF THE IDEA.
00:47:44.737,00:47:46.447,PRECISELY.
00:47:46.489,00:47:48.073,THAT'S THE ONLY WAY IT WILL STICK.
00:47:48.115,00:47:49.241,IT HAS TO SEEM SELF-GENERATED.
00:47:49.283,00:47:50.743,EAMES...
00:47:50.785,00:47:52.911,I AM IMPRESSED.
00:47:52.953,00:47:56.290,"YOUR CONDESCENSION, AS ALWAYS, IS MUCH APPRECIATED, ARTHUR, THANK YOU."
00:48:17.144,00:48:19.772,WERE YOU GOING UNDER ON YOUR OWN?
00:48:19.814,00:48:23.568,"NO, NO, I WAS JUST -- I WAS JUST RUNNING SOME EXPERIMENTS."
00:48:23.609,00:48:25.778,I DIDN'T REALIZE ANYONE WAS HERE.
00:48:25.820,00:48:28.573,"YEAH, I WAS JUST -- I WAS WORKING ON MY TOTEM, ACTUALLY."
00:48:28.614,00:48:29.741,HERE.
00:48:29.782,00:48:33.578,"AH -- SO YOU'RE LEARNING, HUH?"
00:48:33.619,00:48:36.789,AN ELEGANT SOLUTION FOR KEEPING TRACK OF REALITY.
00:48:36.831,00:48:38.791,WAS IT YOUR IDEA?
00:48:38.833,00:48:41.126,"NO, IT WAS..."
00:48:41.168,00:48:42.754,THIS....
00:48:42.795,00:48:44.171,THIS ONE WAS HERS.
00:48:44.213,00:48:46.883,"SHE'D SPIN IT IN THE DREAM, AND IT WOULD NEVER TOPPLE."
00:48:46.923,00:48:48.175,JUST...
00:48:48.217,00:48:50.052,SPIN AND SPIN.
00:48:50.094,00:48:53.097,ARTHUR TOLD ME SHE PASSED AWAY.
00:48:54.766,00:48:57.351,HOW ARE THE MAZES COMING ALONG?
00:48:57.393,00:49:02.607,EACH LEVEL RELATES TO THE PART OF THE SUBJECT'S SUBCONSCIOUS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCESS.
00:49:02.648,00:49:06.652,"SO, I'M MAKING THE BOTTOM LEVEL A HOSPITAL SO FISCHER WILL BRING HIS FATHER."
00:49:06.694,00:49:11.407,"UM, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THIS LAYOUT."
00:49:11.449,00:49:13.409,"NO, NO, NO. DON'T -- DON'T SHOW ME SPECIFICS."
00:49:13.451,00:49:15.327,ONLY THE DREAMER SHOULD KNOW THE LAYOUT.
00:49:15.369,00:49:17.872,WHY IS THAT SO IMPORTANT?
00:49:17.914,00:49:19.749,IN CASE ONE OF US BRINGS IN OUR PROJECTIONS.
00:49:19.791,00:49:21.793,WE DON'T WANT THEM KNOWING THE DETAILS OF THE MAZE.
00:49:21.834,00:49:25.630,YOU MEAN IN CASE YOU BRING MAL IN.
00:49:25.671,00:49:28.382,"YOU CAN'T KEEP HER OUT, CAN YOU?"
00:49:28.424,00:49:29.801,RIGHT.
00:49:29.842,00:49:34.221,"YOU CAN'T BUILD BECAUSE, IF YOU KNOW THE MAZE, THEN SHE KNOWS IT."
00:49:34.263,00:49:36.432,"WELL, SHE'D SABOTAGE THE WHOLE OPERATION."
00:49:36.474,00:49:37.974,"COBB, DO THE OTHERS KNOW?"
00:49:38.016,00:49:39.602,"NO. NO, THEY DON'T."
00:49:39.644,00:49:41.978,YOU'VE GOTTA WARN THEM IF THIS IS GETTING WORSE.
00:49:42.020,00:49:43.063,NO ONE SAID IT'S GETTING WORSE.
00:49:44.189,00:49:45.775,I NEED TO GET HOME.
00:49:45.817,00:49:48.402,THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT RIGHT NOW.
00:49:48.444,00:49:51.029,WHY CAN'T YOU GO HOME?
00:49:53.866,00:49:57.662,BECAUSE THEY THINK I KILLED HER.
00:49:58.663,00:50:01.039,THANK YOU.
00:50:01.081,00:50:02.416,FOR WHAT?
00:50:02.458,00:50:04.168,FOR NOT ASKING WHETHER I DID.
00:50:04.209,00:50:07.212,I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S EMPIRE.
00:50:07.254,00:50:11.300,"NOW, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN IDEA THAT ROBERT HIMSELF WOULD CHOOSE TO REJECT."
00:50:11.342,00:50:14.303,WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO PLANT IT DEEP IN HIS SUBCONSCIOUS.
00:50:14.345,00:50:16.681,"THE SUBCONSCIOUS IS MOTIVATED BY EMOTION, RIGHT?"
00:50:16.722,00:50:18.349,NOT REASON.
00:50:18.390,00:50:21.853,WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO TRANSLATE THIS INTO AN EMOTIONAL CONCEPT.
00:50:21.894,00:50:24.647,HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE A BUSINESS STRATEGY INTO AN EMOTION?
00:50:24.689,00:50:26.148,"THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO FIGURE OUT, RIGHT?"
00:50:26.190,00:50:29.944,"NOW, ROBERT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER IS STRESSED, TO SAY THE LEAST."
00:50:29.986,00:50:31.111,"WELL, CAN WE RUN WITH THAT?"
00:50:31.153,00:50:35.616,WE COULD SUGGEST TO HIM BREAKING UP HIS FATHER'S COMPANY AS A SCREW YOU TO THE OLD MAN.
00:50:35.658,00:50:38.452,"NO, BECAUSE I THINK POSITIVE EMOTION TRUMPS NEGATIVE EMOTION EVERY TIME."
00:50:38.494,00:50:42.498,"WE ALL YEARN FOR RECONCILIATION, FOR CATHARSIS."
00:50:42.540,00:50:46.502,WE NEED ROBERT FISCHER TO HAVE A POSITIVE EMOTIONAL REACTION TO ALL THIS.
00:50:46.544,00:50:48.379,"ALL RIGHT, WELL, TRY THIS."
00:50:48.420,00:50:53.425,"UM, MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."
00:50:53.467,00:50:54.719,THAT MIGHT WORK.
00:50:54.760,00:50:56.804,MIGHT?
00:50:56.846,00:50:58.472,WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DO A LITTLE BETTER THAN MIGHT.
00:50:58.514,00:51:00.558,"OH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION, ARTHUR."
00:51:00.599,00:51:02.727,"FORGIVE ME FOR WANTING A LITTLE SPECIFICITY, EAMES."
00:51:02.768,00:51:04.854,SPECIFICITY?
00:51:04.896,00:51:07.105,INCEPTION'S NOT ABOUT BEING SPECIFIC.
00:51:07.147,00:51:12.068,"WHEN WE GET INSIDE HIS MIND, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK WITH WHAT WE FIND."
00:51:12.110,00:51:18.242,"Eames: ON THE TOP LEVEL, WE OPEN UP HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER, AND SAY, I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS."
00:51:18.283,00:51:23.372,"THEN THE NEXT LEVEL DOWN, WE FEED HIM, I WILL CREATE SOMETHING FOR MYSELF."
00:51:23.414,00:51:26.876,"THEN, BY THE TIME WE HIT THE BOTTOM LEVEL, WE BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS."
00:51:26.918,00:51:29.545,MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE HIM.
00:51:29.587,00:51:34.759,"Arthur: THREE LAYERS DOWN, THE DREAMS ARE GONNA COLLAPSE WITH THE SLIGHTEST DISTURBANCE."
00:51:34.800,00:51:35.927,SEDATION.
00:51:35.968,00:51:42.975,"FOR SLEEP STABLE ENOUGH TO CREATE THREE LAYERS OF DREAMING, WE'LL HAVE TO COMBINE IT WITH AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL SEDATIVE."
00:51:53.903,00:51:55.696,GOOD NIGHT.
00:51:55.738,00:52:02.578,THE COMPOUND WE'LL BE USING TO SHARE THE DREAM CREATES A VERY CLEAR CONNECTION BETWEEN DREAMERS WHILST ACTUALLY ACCELERATING BRAIN FUNCTION.
00:52:02.620,00:52:05.039,"IN OTHER WORDS, IT GIVES US MORE TIME ON EACH LEVEL."
00:52:05.081,00:52:08.333,BRAIN FUNCTION IN THE DREAM WILL BE ABOUT 20 TIMES NORMAL.
00:52:08.375,00:52:12.046,"WHEN YOU ENTER A DREAM WITHIN THAT DREAM, THE EFFECT IS COMPOUNDED."
00:52:12.088,00:52:15.173,"IT'S 3 DREAMS -- THAT'S 10 HOURS TIMES -- I'M SORRY, MATH WAS NEVER MY STRONG SUBJECT."
00:52:15.215,00:52:16.842,H-HOW MUCH TIME IS THAT?
00:52:16.884,00:52:23.933,"IT'S A WEEK, THE FIRST LEVEL DOWN, SIX MONTHS, THE SECOND LEVEL DOWN, AND THE THIRD LEVEL..."
00:52:23.975,00:52:25.141,IT'S 10 YEARS.
00:52:27.812,00:52:29.939,WHO WOULD WANT TO BE STUCK IN A DREAM FOR 10 YEARS?
00:52:29.981,00:52:31.649,DEPENDS ON THE DREAM.
00:52:31.690,00:52:33.859,"SO, ONCE WE'VE MADE THE PLANT, HOW DO WE GET OUT?"
00:52:33.901,00:52:37.613,AND I'M HOPING YOU HAVE SOMETHING MORE ELEGANT IN MIND THAN SHOOTING ME IN THE HEAD.
00:52:37.655,00:52:38.948,A KICK.
00:52:38.990,00:52:40.741,WHAT'S A KICK?
00:52:40.783,00:52:42.868,"THIS, ARIADNE, WOULD BE A KICK."
00:52:46.204,00:52:48.415,IT'S THAT FEELING OF FALLING YOU GET THAT JOLTS YOU AWAKE.
00:52:48.457,00:52:50.001,SNAPS YOU OUT OF THE DREAM.
00:52:50.042,00:52:51.794,ARE WE GONNA FEEL A KICK WITH THIS KIND OF SEDATION?
00:52:51.836,00:52:53.169,"Yusuf: OH, THAT'S THE CLEVER PART."
00:52:53.211,00:52:57.008,I CUSTOMIZED THE SEDATIVE TO LEAVE INNER EAR FUNCTION UNIMPAIRED.
00:52:57.049,00:53:00.886,"THAT WAY, HOWEVER DEEP THE SLEEP, THE SLEEPER STILL FEELS FALLING."
00:53:00.928,00:53:02.596,OR TIPPING.
00:53:04.431,00:53:08.811,THE TRICK IS TO SYNCHRONIZE A KICK THAT CAN PENETRATE ALL THREE LEVELS.
00:53:08.853,00:53:12.064,WE COULD USE THE MUSICAL COUNTDOWN TO SYNCHRONIZE THE DIFFERENT KICKS.
00:53:21.073,00:53:23.117,Eames: HE HASN'T GOT ANY SURGERY SCHEDULED.
00:53:23.159,00:53:24.910,"THERE'S NO DENTAL, NOTHING."
00:53:24.952,00:53:26.620,Cobb: WASN'T HE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A KNEE OPERATION?
00:53:26.662,00:53:28.831,"NOTHING. NOTHING THAT THEY'D PUT HIM UNDER FOR, ANYWAY."
00:53:28.873,00:53:31.207,AND WE NEED -- WE NEED AT LEAST A GOOD 10 HOURS.
00:53:31.249,00:53:33.627,SYDNEY TO LOS ANGELES.
00:53:34.879,00:53:37.173,ONE OF THE LONGEST FLIGHTS IN THE WORLD.
00:53:37.213,00:53:39.091,HE MAKES IT EVERY TWO WEEKS.
00:53:39.133,00:53:41.510,"HE MUST BE FLYING PRIVATE, THEN."
00:53:41.552,00:53:45.097,NOT IF THERE WERE UNEXPECTED MAINTENANCE WITH HIS PLANE.
00:53:45.139,00:53:47.641,Arthur: IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A 747.
00:53:47.683,00:53:52.646,"BECAUSE ON A 747, THE PILOT IS UP TOP, AND THE FIRST-CLASS CABIN IS IN THE NOSE, SO NO ONE WOULD WALK THROUGH."
00:53:52.688,00:53:56.274,BUT YOU'D HAVE TO BUY OUT THE ENTIRE CABIN AND THE FIRST-CLASS FLIGHT ATTENDANT.
00:53:56.316,00:53:57.526,I BOUGHT THE AIRLINE.
00:53:59.153,00:54:01.030,IT SEEMED NEATER.
00:54:02.698,00:54:05.993,"WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE OUR 10 HOURS."
00:54:06.035,00:54:07.953,ARIADNE?
00:54:07.995,00:54:09.287,"TERRIFIC WORK, BY THE WAY."
00:54:56.334,00:55:00.422,Mal: YOU KNOW HOW TO FIND ME.
00:55:00.464,00:55:02.382,YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
00:55:05.803,00:55:09.932,YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO MARRY YOU?
00:55:09.974,00:55:13.602,OF COURSE I DO.
00:55:13.644,00:55:15.938,YOU SAID YOU HAD A DREAM.
00:55:19.066,00:55:22.736,THAT WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER.
00:55:22.778,00:55:25.530,AND WE CAN.
00:55:31.745,00:55:32.997,YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
00:55:37.293,00:55:41.172,I JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT KIND OF TESTS YOU'RE DOING ON YOUR OWN EVERY NIGHT.
00:55:41.213,00:55:42.798,"ALL RIGHT, WELL, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU."
00:55:42.840,00:55:44.340,THIS HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH ME.
00:55:44.382,00:55:45.843,YOU'VE ASKED ME TO SHARE DREAMS WITH YOU.
00:55:45.884,00:55:47.427,NOT THESE.
00:55:47.469,00:55:50.181,THESE ARE MY DREAMS.
00:56:01.192,00:56:03.819,WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF?
00:56:03.861,00:56:06.738,IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN STILL DREAM.
00:56:06.780,00:56:10.784,WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO DREAM?
00:56:10.826,00:56:13.578,"IN MY DREAMS, WE'RE STILL TOGETHER."
00:56:27.383,00:56:29.594,THESE AREN'T JUST DREAMS.
00:56:31.596,00:56:33.057,THESE ARE MEMORIES.
00:56:33.098,00:56:34.641,AND -- AND YOU SAID NEVER TO USE MEMORIES.
00:56:34.683,00:56:36.060,I KNOW I DID.
00:56:36.101,00:56:38.562,YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP HER ALIVE.
00:56:38.603,00:56:40.647,YOU CAN'T LET HER GO.
00:56:40.689,00:56:42.524,YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
00:56:42.566,00:56:45.236,THESE ARE MOMENTS I REGRET.
00:56:45.277,00:56:47.196,THEY'RE MEMORIES THAT I HAVE TO CHANGE.
00:56:47.238,00:56:51.075,"WELL, WHAT'S DOWN THERE THAT YOU REGRET?"
00:56:51.116,00:56:54.119,"LISTEN, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT ME."
00:57:02.169,00:57:04.088,THIS IS YOUR HOUSE?
00:57:04.129,00:57:07.465,"MINE AND MAL'S, YES."
00:57:07.507,00:57:09.885,WHERE IS SHE?
00:57:09.927,00:57:11.511,SHE'S ALREADY GONE.
00:57:16.183,00:57:18.476,"THAT'S MY SON, JAMES."
00:57:18.518,00:57:21.146,"HE'S DIGGING FOR SOMETHING, MAYBE A WORM."
00:57:22.273,00:57:24.233,THAT'S PHILLIPA.
00:57:24.275,00:57:29.487,"SEE, I THOUGHT ABOUT CALLING OUT TO THEM, SO THEY'D TURN AND SMILE AND I COULD SEE THOSE..."
00:57:29.529,00:57:31.698,THOSE BEAUTIFUL FACES OF THEIRS.
00:57:31.740,00:57:33.325,BUT...
00:57:33.367,00:57:35.744,IT'S ALL TOO LATE.
00:57:35.786,00:57:37.537,RIGHT NOW...
00:57:42.584,00:57:44.753,THEN I START TO PANIC.
00:57:44.795,00:57:50.467,"I REALIZE I'M GONNA REGRET THIS MOMENT, THAT I NEED TO SEE THEIR FACES ONE LAST TIME."
00:57:50.508,00:57:51.885,Marie: JAMES! PHILLIPA!
00:57:51.927,00:57:53.720,COME ON IN!
00:57:53.762,00:57:57.057,BUT THE MOMENT'S PAST.
00:57:57.099,00:58:00.560,"AND WHATEVER I DO, I CAN'T CHANGE THIS MOMENT."
00:58:00.602,00:58:04.231,AS I'M ABOUT TO CALL OUT TO THEM...
00:58:04.273,00:58:06.066,THEY RUN AWAY.
00:58:07.985,00:58:12.072,"IF I'M EVER GONNA SEE THEIR FACES AGAIN, I'VE GOTTA GET BACK HOME..."
00:58:13.240,00:58:14.283,...TO THE REAL WORLD.
00:58:56.367,00:58:57.826,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
00:58:57.868,00:59:01.163,MY NAME IS -- I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
00:59:01.205,00:59:02.956,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
00:59:10.964,00:59:13.842,I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.
00:59:13.884,00:59:16.803,HOW COULD YOU UNDERSTAND?
00:59:16.845,00:59:19.348,DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE A LOVER?
00:59:21.475,00:59:23.560,TO BE HALF OF A WHOLE?
00:59:23.601,00:59:25.770,NO.
00:59:27.272,00:59:29.941,I'LL TELL YOU A RIDDLE.
00:59:29.983,00:59:37.449,"YOU'RE WAITING FOR A TRAIN, A TRAIN THAT WILL TAKE YOU FAR AWAY."
00:59:39.201,00:59:45.416,"YOU KNOW WHERE YOU HOPE THIS TRAIN WILL TAKE YOU, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE."
00:59:45.457,00:59:47.792,BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
00:59:47.834,00:59:52.714,HOW CAN IT NOT MATTER TO YOU WHERE THAT TRAIN WILL TAKE YOU?
00:59:52.756,00:59:54.216,Cobb: BECAUSE WE'LL BE TOGETHER.
00:59:54.258,00:59:56.676,"HOW COULD YOU BRING HER HERE, DOM?"
00:59:56.718,00:59:58.053,WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
00:59:58.095,01:00:01.557,THIS IS THE HOTEL SUITE WHERE WE USED TO SPEND OUR ANNIVERSARY.
01:00:01.598,01:00:02.849,WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
01:00:04.935,01:00:06.603,YOU PROMISED!
01:00:06.644,01:00:08.813,YOU PROMISED WE'D BE TOGETHER!
01:00:08.855,01:00:10.441,"PLEASE, I NEED YOU TO STAY HERE JUST FOR NOW!"
01:00:10.482,01:00:11.900,YOU SAID WE'D BE TOGETHER!
01:00:11.942,01:00:14.111,YOU SAID WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER!
01:00:14.152,01:00:16.238,I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU.
01:00:33.922,01:00:40.554,DO YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST BUILD A PRISON OF MEMORIES TO LOCK HER IN?
01:00:40.596,01:00:43.014,DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT THAT'S GONNA CONTAIN HER?
01:00:43.056,01:00:45.142,Saito: IT'S TIME.
01:00:46.310,01:00:48.562,MAURICE FISCHER JUST DIED IN SYDNEY.
01:00:48.604,01:00:50.522,WHEN'S THE FUNERAL?
01:00:50.564,01:00:51.482,IN LOS ANGELES.
01:00:51.523,01:00:54.401,ROBERT SHOULD ACCOMPANY THE BODY NO LATER THAN TUESDAY.
01:00:54.443,01:00:56.694,RIGHT.
01:00:56.736,01:00:57.695,"COBB, I'M COMING WITH YOU."
01:00:57.737,01:00:59.948,I PROMISED MILES. NO.
01:00:59.990,01:01:02.742,THE TEAM NEEDS SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH.
01:01:05.912,01:01:11.042,"A-AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ME, BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO SHOW ARTHUR WHAT I JUST SAW."
01:01:16.340,01:01:18.675,GET US ANOTHER SEAT ON THE PLANE.
01:01:21.886,01:01:26.099,Cobb: IF I GET ON THIS PLANE AND YOU DON'T HONOR OUR AGREEMENT...
01:01:26.141,01:01:29.727,"WHEN WE LAND, I GO TO JAIL FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE."
01:01:29.769,01:01:37.986,"COMPLETE THE JOB EN ROUTE, I MAKE ONE PHONE CALL FROM THE PLANE, YOU HAVE NO TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH IMMIGRATION."
01:01:51.291,01:01:52.959,I'M SORRY.
01:01:53.001,01:01:55.504,"OH, YEAH, I'M SORRY."
01:02:29.037,01:02:31.665,"EXCUSE ME, I THINK THIS IS YOURS?"
01:02:31.707,01:02:33.333,YOU MUST HAVE DROPPED IT.
01:02:33.375,01:02:35.043,WOULD YOU GENTLEMEN CARE FOR A DRINK?
01:02:35.085,01:02:36.378,"UH, WATER, PLEASE."

01:02:43.385,01:02:47.431,"YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE, BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE RELATED TO..."
01:02:47.472,01:02:49.057,"THE MAURICE FISCHER, WOULD YOU?"
01:02:49.099,01:02:50.975,"YES, HE, UM..."
01:02:51.017,01:02:53.604,HE WAS MY FATHER.
01:02:53.645,01:02:56.022,"WELL, HE WAS A VERY INSPIRING FIGURE."
01:02:56.064,01:02:57.566,I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
01:03:00.527,01:03:01.570,HERE YOU GO.
01:03:01.612,01:03:02.779,THANK YOU.

01:03:06.199,01:03:08.826,"MAY HE REST IN PEACE, HUH?"
01:04:16.770,01:04:19.481,COULDN'T HAVE PEED BEFORE YOU WENT UNDER?
01:04:19.523,01:04:21.941,"BIT TOO MUCH FREE CHAMPAGNE BEFORE TAKEOFF, EH, YUSUF?"
01:04:21.983,01:04:23.026,HA HA BLOODY HA.
01:04:23.067,01:04:25.612,"WELL, WE KNOW HE'S GONNA BE LOOKING FOR A TAXI IN THIS WEATHER."
01:04:37.374,01:04:39.083,ASSHOLE!
01:04:39.125,01:04:42.045,"HEY, MAN, WHY DON'T YOU TRY -- WALK AWAY."
01:04:57.977,01:04:59.730,JUST HAVE HIM -- I GOTTA GO.
01:04:59.771,01:05:01.732,ALL RIGHT. TAXI!
01:05:04.359,01:05:08.321,"ALL RIGHT, THIRD AND MARKET."
01:05:08.363,01:05:10.699,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
01:05:10.741,01:05:12.283,"WELL, IT'S NOT."
01:05:12.325,01:05:15.579,"YEAH, MAYBE NOT. CAN YOU PULL OVER AND GET THIS..."
01:05:17.873,01:05:18.707,GREAT.
01:05:23.670,01:05:25.088,COME ON!
01:05:36.808,01:05:39.436,"THERE'S $500 IN THERE, AND THE WALLET'S WORTH MORE THAN THAT."
01:05:39.477,01:05:41.229,SO YOU MIGHT AT LEAST DROP ME AT MY STOP.
01:05:41.271,01:05:42.980,I'M AFRAID IT DOESN'T...
01:05:43.022,01:05:44.357,BULLET!
01:05:52.449,01:05:54.242,COVER HIM!
01:05:54.284,01:05:55.619,WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!
01:06:00.290,01:06:02.125,Ariadne: THIS WASN'T IN THE DESIGN.
01:06:02.166,01:06:04.168,COBB?
01:06:04.210,01:06:05.796,COBB?!
01:06:48.922,01:06:50.590,AAH!
01:06:56.513,01:06:57.639,READY?!
01:07:04.604,01:07:07.691,ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?!
01:07:07.732,01:07:10.401,"FISCHER'S OKAY, UNLESS HE GETS CARSICK."
01:07:10.443,01:07:11.528,SAITO?
01:07:30.588,01:07:32.423,GET FISCHER IN THE BACK ROOM NOW!
01:07:32.465,01:07:34.718,GET HIM IN THE BACK ROOM.
01:07:36.302,01:07:37.428,HAS HE BEEN SHOT?
01:07:37.470,01:07:39.055,I DON'T KNOW.
01:07:39.096,01:07:40.473,WHERE WERE YOU?
01:07:40.515,01:07:41.683,WE WERE BLOCKED BY A FREIGHT TRAIN.
01:07:41.725,01:07:44.101,WHY WOULD YOU PUT A TRAIN CROSSING IN THE MIDDLE OF A DOWNTOWN INTERSECTION?
01:07:44.143,01:07:44.936,"WELL, I DIDN'T."
01:07:44.978,01:07:45.979,WELL WHERE'D IT COME FROM?
01:07:46.021,01:07:46.980,WELL LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION!
01:07:47.022,01:07:48.398,"WHY THE HELL WERE WE AMBUSHED, HUH?!"
01:07:48.439,01:07:49.816,THOSE WERE NOT NORMAL PROJECTIONS!
01:07:49.858,01:07:51.568,"THEY'D BEEN TRAINED, FOR GOD'S SAKES!"
01:07:51.609,01:07:52.569,HOW COULD HE BE TRAINED?!
01:07:52.610,01:07:56.531,HAD AN EXTRACTOR TEACH HIS SUBCONSCIOUS TO DEFEND ITSELF.
01:07:56.573,01:07:58.533,SO HIS SUBCONSCIOUS IS MILITARIZED.
01:07:58.575,01:08:00.368,IT SHOULD'VE SHOWN IN THE RESEARCH. I'M SORRY.
01:08:00.410,01:08:02.328,SO WHY THE HELL DIDN'T IT?
01:08:02.370,01:08:04.163,DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN!
01:08:04.205,01:08:05.498,"THIS WAS YOUR JOB, GODDAMN IT!"
01:08:05.540,01:08:07.333,THIS WAS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!
01:08:07.375,01:08:09.419,YOU WERE MEANT TO CHECK FISCHER'S BACKGROUND THOROUGHLY!
01:08:09.460,01:08:10.962,WE ARE NOT PREPARED FOR THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE!
01:08:11.004,01:08:12.923,WE HAVE DEALT WITH SUB-SECURITY BEFORE!
01:08:12.964,01:08:14.758,"WE'LL BE A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL, AND WE'RE GONNA BE FINE!"
01:08:14.799,01:08:16.968,THIS WAS NOT A PART OF THE PLAN!
01:08:17.010,01:08:18.177,PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY.
01:08:18.219,01:08:19.930,"NO, DON'T DO THAT!"
01:08:19.971,01:08:21.305,DON'T DO THAT.
01:08:21.347,01:08:23.391,HE'S IN AGONY.
01:08:23.433,01:08:25.268,NO.
01:08:25.309,01:08:26.644,"WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT WON'T WAKE HIM UP?"
01:08:26.686,01:08:27.645,IT WON'T WAKE HIM UP.
01:08:27.687,01:08:28.980,"WHEN WE DIE IN A DREAM, WE WAKE UP."
01:08:29.022,01:08:31.024,NOT FROM THIS.
01:08:31.066,01:08:33.401,WE'RE TOO HEAVILY SEDATED TO WAKE UP THAT WAY.
01:08:33.443,01:08:35.904,"RIGHT. SO, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DIE?"
01:08:35.946,01:08:37.906,WE DROP INTO LIMBO.
01:08:37.948,01:08:40.033,LIMBO?!
01:08:40.075,01:08:41.785,"WELL, WHAT THE HELL IS DOWN THERE?"
01:08:41.826,01:08:43.369,"JUST RAW, INFINITE SUBCONSCIOUS."
01:08:43.411,01:08:50.126,"NOTHING IS DOWN THERE, EXCEPT FOR WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND BY ANYONE SHARING THE DREAM WHO'S BEEN TRAPPED THERE BEFORE."
01:08:50.167,01:08:52.420,"WHICH, IN OUR CASE, IS JUST YOU."
01:08:52.462,01:08:54.171,"WELL, HOW LONG COULD WE BE STUCK THERE?"
01:08:54.213,01:08:57.300,Yusuf: CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT TRYING TO ESCAPE UNTIL THE SEDATION HAS EASED.
01:08:57.341,01:08:58.551,DECADES.
01:08:58.593,01:08:59.594,I DON'T KNOW. ASK HIM.
01:08:59.636,01:09:00.971,HE'S THE ONE WHO'S BEEN THERE.
01:09:01.012,01:09:02.722,Arthur: LET'S JUST GET HIM UPSTAIRS.
01:09:04.057,01:09:05.809,GREAT.
01:09:05.850,01:09:07.477,THANK YOU.
01:09:07.518,01:09:11.564,"SO, NOW WE'RE TRAPPED IN FISCHER'S MIND, BATTLING HIS OWN PRIVATE ARMY."
01:09:11.606,01:09:17.028,"AND IF WE GET KILLED, WE'LL BE LOST IN LIMBO TILL OUR BRAINS TURN TO SCRAMBLED EGG, HMM?"
01:09:23.785,01:09:24.995,SOMEONE GOT FIRST AID?
01:09:27.622,01:09:30.291,"SO, YOU KNEW ABOUT THESE RISKS, AND YOU DIDN'T TELL US?"
01:09:30.333,01:09:31.668,THERE WEREN'T MEANT TO BE ANY RISKS.
01:09:31.709,01:09:33.711,I DIDN'T KNOW WE'D BE DEALING WITH A LOAD OF GUNFIRE.
01:09:33.753,01:09:34.921,YOU HAD NO RIGHT.
01:09:34.963,01:09:36.673,THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GO THREE LAYERS DEEP.
01:09:36.714,01:09:38.591,AND YOU.
01:09:38.633,01:09:39.968,YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS AND WENT ALONG WITH IT?
01:09:40.010,01:09:41.177,I TRUSTED HIM!
01:09:41.218,01:09:42.386,WHEN? WHEN HE PROMISED YOU HALF HIS SHARE?
01:09:42.428,01:09:44.639,NO. HIS WHOLE SHARE.
01:09:44.681,01:09:45.974,"BESIDES, HE SAID HE'D DONE IT BEFORE."
01:09:46.016,01:09:47.642,"OH, HE'D DONE IT BEFORE."
01:09:47.684,01:09:48.559,'CAUSE THAT WORKED SO GOOD?
01:09:48.601,01:09:49.853,THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
01:09:49.894,01:09:51.855,I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO TO GET BACK TO MY CHILDREN.
01:09:51.896,01:09:54.231,SO YOU LED US INTO A WAR ZONE WITH NO WAY OUT.
01:09:54.273,01:09:55.191,THERE IS A WAY OUT.
01:09:55.232,01:10:00.822,"WE CONTINUE ON WITH THE JOB, AND WE DO IT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, AND WE GET OUT USING THE KICK, JUST LIKE BEFORE."
01:10:00.864,01:10:03.700,"FORGET IT. WE GO ANY DEEPER, WE JUST RAISE THE STAKES."
01:10:03.741,01:10:05.869,"I AM SITTING THIS ONE OUT ON THIS LEVEL, BOYS."
01:10:05.910,01:10:08.204,FISCHER'S SECURITY IS SURROUNDING THIS PLACE AS WE SPEAK.
01:10:08.245,01:10:10.748,10 HOURS OF FLIGHT TIME IS A WEEK AT THIS LEVEL.
01:10:10.790,01:10:13.043,THAT MEANS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US WILL BE KILLED.
01:10:13.084,01:10:14.627,THAT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU.
01:10:14.669,01:10:18.339,WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO CONTINUE ON AND DO IT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.
01:10:20.257,01:10:22.844,DOWNWARDS IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARDS.
01:10:22.886,01:10:26.056,GET READY.
01:10:26.097,01:10:27.640,"YOU, COME ON."
01:10:32.395,01:10:35.398,I'M INSURED AGAINST KIDNAPPING FOR UP TO 10 MILLION.
01:10:35.439,01:10:37.274,THIS SHOULD BE VERY SIMPLE.
01:10:37.316,01:10:38.735,SHUT UP!
01:10:38.776,01:10:42.113,"IN YOUR FATHER'S OFFICE, BELOW THE BOOKSHELVES, IS HIS PERSONAL SAFE."
01:10:42.155,01:10:43.907,WE NEED THE COMBINATION.
01:10:43.948,01:10:46.367,I DON'T KNOW ANY SAFE.
01:10:46.409,01:10:48.661,THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW THE COMBINATION.
01:10:50.287,01:10:52.248,TELL US WHAT IT IS.
01:10:52.289,01:10:55.043,I DON'T KNOW.
01:10:59.756,01:11:02.092,WE HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY YOU DO KNOW.
01:11:02.133,01:11:04.468,YEAH? WHOSE AUTHORITY?
01:11:04.510,01:11:07.430,"$500, THIS COST?"
01:11:07.471,01:11:09.306,WHAT'S INSIDE IT?
01:11:09.348,01:11:11.559,"CASH, CARDS, I.D..."
01:11:11.601,01:11:13.186,AND THIS.
01:11:17.899,01:11:19.943,USEFUL?
01:11:19.984,01:11:21.903,MAYBE.
01:11:21.945,01:11:24.280,Cobb: YOU'RE ON.
01:11:24.321,01:11:26.950,AN HOUR?
01:11:26.991,01:11:29.285,I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ALL NIGHT TO CRACK THIS.
01:11:29.326,01:11:31.454,AND SAITO WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE SHOT IN THE CHEST.
01:11:31.495,01:11:32.789,YOU'VE GOT ONE HOUR.
01:11:32.830,01:11:35.125,"NOW, GET US SOMETHING USEFUL, PLEASE."
01:11:37.835,01:11:39.129,WHAT'S THAT?
01:11:39.170,01:11:40.337,GOOD AUTHORITY.
01:11:43.841,01:11:46.010,UNCLE PETER.
01:11:46.052,01:11:48.387,JUST -- JUST MAKE THEM STOP.
01:11:48.429,01:11:50.140,THE COMBINATION.
01:11:50.181,01:11:51.849,I DON'T KNOW IT.
01:11:51.891,01:11:54.644,WHY DOES BROWNING SAY YOU DO?
01:11:54.685,01:11:56.896,"JUST LET ME TALK TO HIM, AND I'LL FIND OUT."
01:11:59.857,01:12:02.068,YOU HAVE ONE HOUR!
01:12:03.402,01:12:04.904,AHH.
01:12:04.946,01:12:06.948,AAH.
01:12:06.990,01:12:08.407,YOU OKAY?
01:12:11.828,01:12:15.414,THOSE BASTARDS HAVE HAD AT ME FOR TWO DAYS.
01:12:15.456,01:12:20.795,"THEY HAVE SOMEONE WITH ACCESS TO YOUR FATHER'S OFFICE, AND THEY'RE TRYING TO OPEN HIS SAFE."
01:12:20.837,01:12:24.007,"THEY THOUGHT I'D KNOW THE COMBINATION, BUT I DON'T KNOW IT."
01:12:24.048,01:12:25.549,"YEAH, WELL, NEITHER DO I, SO..."
01:12:25.591,01:12:26.968,WHAT?
01:12:27.010,01:12:30.972,"MAURICE TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE PASSED, YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO OPEN IT."
01:12:31.014,01:12:33.599,"NO, HE NEVER -- HE NEVER GAVE ME ANY COMBINATION."
01:12:33.641,01:12:35.643,MAYBE HE DID.
01:12:35.685,01:12:38.437,MAYBE YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THE COMBINATION.
01:12:38.479,01:12:40.773,"WELL, WHAT, THEN?"
01:12:40.815,01:12:46.070,SOME MEANINGFUL COMBINATION OF NUMBERS BASED ON YOUR -- YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH MAURICE.
01:12:47.822,01:12:50.200,"WE DIDN'T HAVE VERY MANY, UM..."
01:12:50.241,01:12:52.451,MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCES TOGETHER.
01:12:52.493,01:12:54.411,PERHAPS AFTER YOUR MOTHER DIED.
01:12:57.332,01:12:59.959,"AFTER MY MOTHER DIED, YOU KNOW WHAT HE TOLD ME?"
01:13:00.001,01:13:03.671,"ROBERT, THERE'S REALLY..."
01:13:03.713,01:13:06.716,NOTHING TO BE SAID.
01:13:06.757,01:13:09.093,"OH, WELL, HE WAS BAD WITH EMOTION."
01:13:09.135,01:13:11.971,"I WAS 11, UNCLE PETER."
01:13:12.013,01:13:13.139,HOW'S HE DOIN'?
01:13:13.181,01:13:15.516,HE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN.
01:13:15.558,01:13:19.062,"WHEN WE GET DOWN TO THE LOWER LEVELS, THE PAIN WILL BE LESS INTENSE."
01:13:19.103,01:13:21.189,AND IF HE DIES?
01:13:21.231,01:13:22.899,WORST-CASE SCENARIO?
01:13:22.940,01:13:26.819,"WHEN HE WAKES UP, HIS MIND IS COMPLETELY GONE."
01:13:26.861,01:13:28.612,Saito: COBB...
01:13:28.654,01:13:31.324,I'LL STILL HONOR THE ARRANGEMENT.
01:13:31.366,01:13:32.658,"I APPRECIATE THAT, SAITO."
01:13:32.700,01:13:36.537,"BUT WHEN YOU WAKE UP, YOU WON'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT WE HAD AN ARRANGEMENT."
01:13:36.579,01:13:38.789,LIMBO IS GONNA BECOME YOUR REALITY.
01:13:38.831,01:13:43.127,YOU'RE GONNA BE LOST DOWN THERE SO LONG THAT YOU'RE GONNA BECOME AN OLD MAN.
01:13:43.169,01:13:44.879,FILLED WITH REGRET?
01:13:44.921,01:13:47.298,WAITING TO DIE ALONE.
01:13:47.340,01:13:49.217,NO.
01:13:49.259,01:13:51.510,I'LL COME BACK.
01:13:51.552,01:13:54.471,AND WE'LL BE YOUNG MEN TOGETHER AGAIN.
01:14:00.144,01:14:01.896,BREATHE.
01:14:01.938,01:14:04.648,THESE PEOPLE ARE GONNA KILL US IF WE DON'T GIVE THEM THE COMBINATION.
01:14:04.690,01:14:06.109,THEY JUST WANT TO RANSOM US.
01:14:06.150,01:14:07.944,I HEARD THEM.
01:14:07.985,01:14:11.322,"THEY'RE GONNA LOCK US IN THAT VAN, AND THEN DRIVE IT INTO THE RIVER."
01:14:11.364,01:14:12.865,ALL RIGHT.
01:14:12.907,01:14:15.243,SOMETHING FOR YOU.
01:14:15.285,01:14:21.749,MAURICE ALWAYS SAID IT WAS HIS MOST PRECIOUS GIFT TO YOU -- A WILL.
01:14:21.791,01:14:23.459,MAURICE'S WILL IS WITH PORT AND DUNN.
01:14:23.500,01:14:25.169,THAT'S AN ALTERNATE.
01:14:25.211,01:14:27.880,THIS WOULD SUPERSEDE THE OTHER IF YOU WANT IT TO.
01:14:27.922,01:14:30.591,IT SPLITS UP THE COMPONENT BUSINESSES OF FISCHER MORROW.
01:14:30.633,01:14:34.470,IT'D BE THE END OF THE ENTIRE EMPIRE AS WE KNOW IT.
01:14:34.511,01:14:37.514,DESTROYING MY WHOLE INHERITANCE.
01:14:37.556,01:14:40.351,WHY WOULD HE SUGGEST SUCH A THING?
01:14:40.393,01:14:41.727,I JUST DON'T KNOW.
01:14:43.813,01:14:46.649,"HE LOVED YOU, ROBERT."
01:14:46.690,01:14:48.401,IN HIS OWN WAY.
01:14:48.443,01:14:51.154,IN HIS OWN WAY?
01:14:51.195,01:14:53.697,AT THE END...
01:14:53.739,01:14:56.533,HE CALLED ME IN TO HIS DEATHBED.
01:14:56.575,01:14:59.578,HE COULD BARELY SPEAK.
01:14:59.620,01:15:04.417,BUT HE TOOK THE TROUBLE TO TELL ME ONE LAST THING.
01:15:06.336,01:15:08.629,HE PULLED ME CLOSE.
01:15:10.673,01:15:14.051,AND I COULD ONLY MAKE OUT...
01:15:14.093,01:15:15.719,ONE WORD.
01:15:18.722,01:15:21.809,DISAPPOINTED.
01:15:27.190,01:15:28.316,WHEN WERE YOU IN LIMBO?
01:15:29.942,01:15:34.322,"YOU MIGHT HAVE THE REST OF THE TEAM CONVINCED TO CARRY ON WITH THIS JOB, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THE TRUTH."
01:15:34.364,01:15:35.823,TRUTH? WHAT TRUTH?
01:15:35.865,01:15:40.328,"THE TRUTH THAT, AT ANY MINUTE, YOU MIGHT BRING A FREIGHT TRAIN THROUGH THE WALL."
01:15:40.370,01:15:44.832,THE TRUTH THAT MAL IS BURSTING THROUGH YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS.
01:15:44.874,01:15:49.253,"AND THE TRUTH THAT, AS WE GO DEEPER INTO FISCHER, WE'RE ALSO GOING DEEPER INTO YOU."
01:15:49.295,01:15:53.049,AND...I'M NOT SURE WE'RE GONNA LIKE WHAT WE FIND.
01:15:56.511,01:15:58.429,WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER.
01:15:58.471,01:16:01.516,WE WERE EXPLORING THE CONCEPT OF A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM.
01:16:01.557,01:16:03.059,I KEPT PUSHING THINGS.
01:16:03.100,01:16:05.436,I WANTED TO GO DEEPER AND DEEPER.
01:16:05.478,01:16:07.271,I WANTED TO GO...FURTHER.
01:16:07.313,01:16:16.364,"I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT THAT HOURS COULD TURN INTO YEARS DOWN THERE, THAT WE COULD GET TRAPPED SO DEEP THAT WHEN WE..."
01:16:16.406,01:16:23.704,"WHEN WE WOUND UP ON THE SHORE OF OUR OWN SUBCONSCIOUS, WE LOST SIGHT OF WHAT WAS REAL."
01:16:28.959,01:16:32.171,"WE CREATED, WE BUILT THE WORLD FOR OURSELVES."
01:16:32.213,01:16:36.633,WE DID THAT FOR YEARS.
01:16:36.675,01:16:40.054,WE BUILT OUR OWN WORLD.
01:16:40.096,01:16:41.889,HOW LONG WERE YOU STUCK THERE?
01:16:41.931,01:16:45.684,SOMETHING LIKE 50 YEARS.
01:16:47.853,01:16:51.065,JESUS.
01:16:51.107,01:16:53.484,HOW COULD YOU STAND IT?
01:16:53.526,01:16:57.154,"IT WASN'T SO BAD AT FIRST, FEELING LIKE GODS."
01:16:57.196,01:16:59.740,THE PROBLEM WAS KNOWING THAT NONE OF IT WAS REAL.
01:16:59.782,01:17:04.078,"EVENTUALLY, IT JUST BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO LIVE LIKE THAT."
01:17:04.120,01:17:05.496,AND WHAT ABOUT FOR HER?
01:17:07.540,01:17:14.297,"SHE HAD LOCKED SOMETHING AWAY, SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE HER."
01:17:14.338,01:17:17.425,"A TRUTH THAT SHE HAD ONCE KNOWN, BUT..."
01:17:17.467,01:17:19.343,BUT CHOSE TO FORGET.
01:17:22.305,01:17:25.891,LIMBO BECAME HER REALITY.
01:17:25.933,01:17:28.269,WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WOKE UP?
01:17:28.311,01:17:32.523,"WELL, TO WAKE UP FROM THAT AFTER -- AFTER YEARS, AFTER DECADES..."
01:17:32.565,01:17:37.903,TO BECOME OLD SOULS THROWN BACK INTO YOUTH LIKE THAT?
01:17:37.945,01:17:40.531,I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH HER.
01:17:40.573,01:17:43.867,SHE JUST WOULDN'T ADMIT IT.
01:17:43.909,01:17:46.703,"EVENTUALLY, SHE TOLD ME THE TRUTH."
01:17:46.745,01:17:56.172,SHE WAS POSSESSED BY AN IDEA -- THIS ONE VERY SIMPLE IDEA THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING.
01:17:56.213,01:17:59.550,THAT OUR WORLD WASN'T REAL.
01:17:59.592,01:18:04.930,"THAT SHE NEEDED TO WAKE UP TO COME BACK TO REALITY, THAT..."
01:18:04.972,01:18:07.850,IN ORDER TO GET BACK HOME...
01:18:07.891,01:18:10.060,WE HAD TO KILL OURSELVES.
01:18:16.733,01:18:18.902,WHAT ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN?
01:18:18.944,01:18:23.782,"SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE PROJECTIONS, THAT OUR REAL CHILDREN WERE WAITING FOR US UP THERE SOMEWHERE."
01:18:23.824,01:18:25.117,Mal: I'M THEIR MOTHER!
01:18:25.159,01:18:26.702,CALM DOWN.
01:18:26.743,01:18:28.120,DON'T YOU THINK I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE?
01:18:28.162,01:18:29.913,"IF THIS IS MY DREAM, WHY CAN'T I CONTROL THIS?"
01:18:29.955,01:18:31.374,BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE DREAMING!
01:18:31.415,01:18:37.754,"SHE WAS CERTAIN THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I BEGGED, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I PLEADED."
01:18:40.383,01:18:44.094,"SHE WANTED TO DO IT, BUT SHE COULD NOT DO IT ALONE."
01:18:44.136,01:18:46.847,"SHE LOVED ME TOO MUCH, SO..."
01:18:46.889,01:18:50.601,SHE CAME UP WITH A PLAN ON OUR ANNIVERSARY.
01:19:16.168,01:19:18.128,"SWEETHEART, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
01:19:18.170,01:19:20.130,JOIN ME.
01:19:20.172,01:19:22.466,JUST -- JUST STEP BACK INSIDE.
01:19:22.508,01:19:24.009,JUST STEP BACK INSIDE NOW.
01:19:24.051,01:19:25.886,NO.
01:19:25.928,01:19:28.431,"I'M GOING TO JUMP, AND YOU'RE COMING WITH ME."
01:19:28.472,01:19:30.474,"NO, I'M NOT."
01:19:30.516,01:19:32.435,"N-NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME."
01:19:32.476,01:19:35.730,"IF YOU JUMP, YOU'RE NOT GONNA WAKE UP, REMEMBER?"
01:19:35.771,01:19:37.147,YOU'RE GONNA DIE.
01:19:37.189,01:19:39.442,"NOW, JUST -- JUST STEP BACK INSIDE."
01:19:39.483,01:19:41.068,COME ON.
01:19:41.110,01:19:43.070,STEP BACK INSIDE SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS.
01:19:43.112,01:19:45.406,WE'VE TALKED ENOUGH.
01:19:46.156,01:19:47.866,MAL.
01:19:47.908,01:19:50.160,"COME OUT ONTO THE LEDGE, OR I'LL JUMP RIGHT NOW."
01:19:50.202,01:19:51.245,OKAY.
01:19:54.331,01:19:57.627,WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS.
01:19:57.668,01:19:59.503,ALL RIGHT?
01:19:59.545,01:20:02.423,I'M ASKING YOU TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH.
01:20:02.465,01:20:04.467,"NO, HONEY."
01:20:04.508,01:20:09.054,"NO, I CA-- YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THAT."
01:20:09.096,01:20:11.724,"TAKE A SECOND, THINK ABOUT OUR CHILDREN."
01:20:11.766,01:20:14.727,THINK ABOUT JAMES.
01:20:14.769,01:20:16.520,THINK ABOUT PHILLIPA NOW.
01:20:16.562,01:20:18.897,"IF I GO WITHOUT YOU, THEY'LL TAKE THEM AWAY ANYWAY."
01:20:18.939,01:20:20.733,WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
01:20:20.775,01:20:25.488,"I FILED A LETTER WITH OUR ATTORNEY, EXPLAINING HOW I'M FEARFUL FOR MY SAFETY."
01:20:28.865,01:20:30.326,HOW YOU'VE THREATENED TO KILL ME.
01:20:33.162,01:20:34.664,WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
01:20:34.705,01:20:36.123,"I LOVE YOU, DOM."
01:20:36.165,01:20:38.875,WHY DID YOU -- WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?
01:20:38.917,01:20:41.170,I'VE FREED YOU FROM THE GUILT OF CHOOSING TO LEAVE THEM.
01:20:41.211,01:20:44.214,WE'RE GOING HOME TO OUR REAL CHILDREN.
01:20:44.256,01:20:46.509,"OH, NO, NO, NO. MAL, YOU LISTEN TO ME, ALL RIGHT?"
01:20:46.550,01:20:47.802,"MAL, LOOK AT ME, PLEASE?!"
01:20:47.843,01:20:49.512,YOU'RE WAITING FOR A TRAIN.
01:20:49.553,01:20:51.305,"MAL, GODDAMN IT, DON'T DO THIS!"
01:20:51.347,01:20:54.141,A TRAIN THAT WILL TAKE YOU FAR AWAY.
01:20:54.183,01:20:56.352,JAMES AND PHILLIPA ARE WAITING FOR US!
01:20:56.393,01:20:58.103,YOU KNOW WHERE YOU HOPE THIS TRAIN WILL TAKE YOU.
01:20:58.145,01:20:59.522,THEY'RE WAITING FOR US!
01:20:59.563,01:21:01.190,"MAL, LOOK AT ME!"
01:21:01.231,01:21:03.734,BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
01:21:03.776,01:21:05.736,BECAUSE YOU'LL BE TOGETHER.
01:21:05.778,01:21:07.697,SWEETHEART!
01:21:07.738,01:21:09.532,"MAL, NO!!"
01:21:09.573,01:21:10.949,JESUS CHRIST!
01:21:14.995,01:21:17.707,SHE HAD HERSELF DECLARED SANE BY THREE DIFFERENT PSYCHIATRISTS.
01:21:17.748,01:21:22.085,IT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TRY TO EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF HER MADNESS.
01:21:22.127,01:21:24.046,"SO, I RAN."
01:21:25.381,01:21:28.008,RIGHT NOW...
01:21:34.097,01:21:36.684,Marie: JAMES! PHILLIPA!
01:21:36.726,01:21:38.728,COME ON IN! COME ON!
01:21:38.769,01:21:40.521,"ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO."
01:21:40.563,01:21:44.692,"Cobb: I LEFT MY CHILDREN BEHIND, AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BUY MY WAY BACK EVER SINCE."
01:21:44.734,01:21:47.361,YOUR GUILT DEFINES HER.
01:21:47.403,01:21:49.530,IT'S WHAT POWERS HER.
01:21:49.572,01:21:52.825,BUT YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IDEA THAT DESTROYED HER.
01:21:52.867,01:21:56.579,AND IF WE ARE GONNA SUCCEED IN THIS...
01:21:56.620,01:21:59.039,YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE YOURSELF...
01:21:59.081,01:22:01.751,AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONFRONT HER.
01:22:01.792,01:22:03.377,BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT ALONE.
01:22:03.419,01:22:06.338,"NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT -- I'M DOING IT FOR THE OTHERS."
01:22:06.380,01:22:11.719,BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO IDEA THE RISK THEY'VE TAKEN COMING DOWN HERE WITH YOU.
01:22:16.181,01:22:17.516,WE HAVE TO MOVE.
01:22:17.558,01:22:19.769,TIME'S UP.
01:22:19.810,01:22:21.771,ALL RIGHT.
01:22:21.812,01:22:23.188,"NOT CONSCIOUSLY, ANYWAY."
01:22:23.230,01:22:25.148,"HOW ABOUT INSTINCTIVELY, HUH?"
01:22:25.190,01:22:29.862,I GOT SOMEBODY STANDING IN YOUR FATHER'S OFFICE RIGHT NOW READY TO TAP IN THE COMBINATION.
01:22:29.904,01:22:33.407,GIVE ME THE FIRST SIX NUMBERS THAT COME TO YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW.
01:22:33.449,01:22:36.159,I HAVE NO IDEA.
01:22:36.201,01:22:38.370,"I SAID, RIGHT NOW!"
01:22:38.412,01:22:40.831,"FIVE, TWO, EIGHT..."
01:22:40.873,01:22:42.207,"FOUR, NINE, ONE."
01:22:44.543,01:22:47.254,TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.
01:22:47.296,01:22:49.757,ALL RIGHT. BAG 'EM.
01:22:49.799,01:22:51.467,YOU'RE GOING FOR A RIDE.
01:22:55.721,01:22:57.640,Fischer: WE'RE WORTH MORE TO YOU ALIVE.
01:22:57.681,01:22:59.767,YOU HEAR ME?
01:23:04.271,01:23:05.689,WHAT'D YOU GET?
01:23:07.566,01:23:09.819,THAT BOY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER IS EVEN WORSE THAN WE IMAGINED.
01:23:09.860,01:23:11.278,THIS HELPS US HOW?
01:23:11.320,01:23:15.073,"THE STRONGER THE ISSUES, THE MORE POWERFUL THE CATHARSIS."
01:23:15.115,01:23:17.827,HOW ARE WE GONNA RECONCILE THEM IF THEY'RE SO ESTRANGED?
01:23:17.868,01:23:19.787,"WELL, I'M WORKING ON THAT, AREN'T I?"
01:23:19.829,01:23:22.289,THE PROJECTIONS ARE CLOSING IN QUICK.
01:23:22.331,01:23:25.250,WE GOTTA BREAK OUT OF HERE BEFORE WE'RE TOTALLY BOXED IN.
01:24:01.662,01:24:05.415,"WE MUSTN'T BE AFRAID TO DREAM A LITTLE BIGGER, DARLING."
01:24:21.473,01:24:25.310,NOW WE NEED TO SHIFT HIS ANIMOSITY FROM HIS FATHER TO HIS GODFATHER.
01:24:25.352,01:24:27.062,YOU'RE GONNA DESTROY HIS ONE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP?
01:24:27.103,01:24:31.567,"NO, WE REPAIR HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER WHILST EXPOSING HIS GODFATHER'S TRUE NATURE."
01:24:31.608,01:24:34.778,WE SHOULD CHARGE FISCHER A LOT MORE THAN SAITO FOR THIS JOB.
01:24:34.820,01:24:35.821,Arthur: WHAT ABOUT HIS SECURITY?
01:24:35.863,01:24:37.573,IT'S GONNA GET WORSE AS WE GO DEEPER.
01:24:37.614,01:24:40.367,I THINK WE RUN WITH MR. CHARLES.
01:24:40.409,01:24:41.911,Eames: WHO'S MR. CHARLES?
01:24:41.952,01:24:45.873,"THE SECOND WE GET INTO THAT HOTEL AND APPROACH FISCHER, HIS SECURITY IS GONNA BE ALL OVER US."
01:24:45.915,01:24:48.124,WE RUN WITH MR. CHARLES LIKE WE DID ON THE STEIN JOB.
01:24:48.166,01:24:50.502,SO YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE?
01:24:50.544,01:24:54.339,"THE SUBJECT REALIZED HE WAS DREAMING, AND HIS SUBCONSCIOUS TORE US TO PIECES."
01:24:54.381,01:24:56.592,EXCELLENT.
01:24:56.633,01:24:58.552,I'M GONNA NEED SOME KIND OF DISTRACTION.
01:24:58.594,01:25:01.137,HOW ABOUT A LOVELY LADY WHO I'VE USED BEFORE?
01:25:01.179,01:25:03.306,"LISTEN TO ME. YOU DRIVE CAREFULLY, ALL RIGHT?"
01:25:03.348,01:25:05.684,EVERYTHING DOWN THERE IS GONNA BE UNSTABLE AS HELL.
01:25:09.730,01:25:11.314,Arthur: DON'T JUMP TOO SOON.
01:25:11.356,01:25:13.483,WE ONLY GOT ONE SHOT AT THAT KICK. WE GOTTA MAKE IT.
01:25:13.525,01:25:14.985,I'LL PLAY THE MUSIC TO LET YOU KNOW IT'S COMING.
01:25:15.027,01:25:17.195,THE REST IS ON YOU.
01:25:17.237,01:25:18.363,YOU READY?
01:25:20.323,01:25:21.575,SWEET DREAMS.
01:25:21.617,01:25:24.244,Woman: AM I BORING YOU?
01:25:24.286,01:25:25.746,I WAS TELLING YOU MY STORY.
01:25:25.788,01:25:28.082,I GUESS IT WASN'T TO YOUR LIKING.
01:25:28.123,01:25:30.042,UH...
01:25:30.084,01:25:32.711,"UM, I HAVE A LOT ON MY MIND."
01:25:32.753,01:25:35.547,THERE GOES MR. CHARLES.
01:25:40.010,01:25:43.263,"MR. FISCHER, RIGHT?"
01:25:43.305,01:25:45.808,PLEASURE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
01:25:45.849,01:25:47.559,I...HMM.
01:25:47.601,01:25:48.685,AND YOU MUST BE?
01:25:48.727,01:25:49.979,LEAVING.
01:25:53.899,01:25:55.191,IN CASE YOU GET BORED.
01:26:00.238,01:26:01.991,SHE MUST'VE BLOWN YOU OFF.
01:26:02.032,01:26:04.576,"THAT IS, UNLESS HER PHONE NUMBER REALLY IS ONLY SIX DIGITS."
01:26:06.078,01:26:11.959,"FUNNY WAY TO MAKE FRIENDS, SOMEONE STEALING YOUR WALLET LIKE THAT."
01:26:15.253,01:26:18.841,"GODDAMN IT. THE WALLET ALONE IS WORTH AT LEAST FIVE -- ABOUT $500, RIGHT?"
01:26:18.882,01:26:20.258,"LISTEN, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT."
01:26:20.300,01:26:22.260,"MY PEOPLE ARE ALREADY ON IT, AS WE SPEAK."
01:26:22.302,01:26:24.096,WHO OR WHAT IS MR. CHARLES?
01:26:24.138,01:26:28.350,IT'S A GAMBIT DESIGNED TO TURN FISCHER AGAINST HIS OWN SUBCONSCIOUS.
01:26:28.391,01:26:30.310,AND WHY DON'T YOU APPROVE?
01:26:30.352,01:26:34.439,"BECAUSE IT INVOLVES TELLING THE MARK THAT HE'S DREAMING, WHICH INVOLVES ATTRACTING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO US."
01:26:34.481,01:26:36.441,DIDN'T COBB SAY NEVER TO DO THAT?
01:26:36.483,01:26:40.863,MM. SO NOW YOU'VE NOTICED HOW MUCH TIME COBB SPENDS DOING THINGS HE SAYS NEVER TO DO.
01:26:43.615,01:26:45.408,"MR. SAITO, CAN I HAVE A MOMENT?"
01:26:45.450,01:26:46.910,"I-I'M SORRY, BUT..."
01:26:46.952,01:26:48.203,Man: HOLD ON! WAIT!
01:26:48.244,01:26:50.706,YOU LOOK A BIT PERKIER.
01:26:50.747,01:26:53.042,"VERY AMUSING, MR. EAMES."
01:26:59.214,01:27:01.216,TURBULENCE ON THE PLANE?
01:27:01.257,01:27:02.843,"NO, IT'S MUCH CLOSER."
01:27:02.885,01:27:04.636,THAT'S YUSUF'S DRIVING.
01:27:12.561,01:27:14.897,"UH, I'M SORRY."
01:27:14.938,01:27:16.940,Cobb: ROD GREEN FROM MARKETING.
01:27:16.982,01:27:19.484,"BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL, IS IT?"
01:27:20.903,01:27:24.489,MY NAME IS MR. CHARLES.
01:27:24.531,01:27:27.367,I'M THE HEAD OF YOUR SECURITY DOWN HERE.
01:27:28.535,01:27:30.204,GET OUT ON A DIFFERENT FLOOR AND KEEP MOVING.
01:27:30.245,01:27:31.830,DUMP THE WALLET.
01:27:31.872,01:27:33.957,SECURITY WILL BE LOOKING FOR THAT.
01:27:33.999,01:27:36.251,WE NEED TO BUY COBB A LITTLE MORE TIME.
01:27:39.963,01:27:43.341,"SECURITY, HUH?"
01:27:43.383,01:27:45.301,YOU WORK FOR THE HOTEL?
01:27:45.343,01:27:47.096,"NO, NO."
01:27:47.137,01:27:50.682,I SPECIALIZE IN A VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF SECURITY.
01:27:50.724,01:27:53.393,SUBCONSCIOUS SECURITY.
01:27:53.435,01:27:55.478,YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DREAMS?
01:27:55.520,01:27:57.147,"ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, UM..."
01:27:57.189,01:27:58.523,EXTRACTION?
01:27:58.565,01:28:01.777,I AM HERE TO PROTECT YOU.
01:28:13.705,01:28:20.087,"MR. FISCHER, I'M HERE TO PROTECT YOU IN THE EVENT THAT SOMEONE TRIES TO ACCESS YOUR MIND THROUGH YOUR DREAMS."
01:28:20.129,01:28:23.257,YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE.
01:28:23.298,01:28:25.467,THEY'RE COMING FOR YOU.
01:28:37.980,01:28:39.481,OHH!
01:28:43.443,01:28:45.946,"STRANGE WEATHER, ISN'T IT?"
01:28:49.992,01:28:51.910,YOU FEEL THAT?
01:28:53.578,01:28:55.330,WHAT'S HAPPENING?
01:28:55.371,01:29:01.003,"COBB IS DRAWING FISCHER'S ATTENTION TO THE STRANGENESS OF THE DREAM, WHICH IS MAKING HIS SUBCONSCIOUS LOOK FOR THE DREAMER."
01:29:01.044,01:29:02.629,FOR ME.
01:29:02.671,01:29:04.047,"QUICK, GIVE ME A KISS."
01:29:09.261,01:29:11.554,THEY'RE STILL LOOKING AT US.
01:29:11.596,01:29:13.974,"YEAH, IT WAS WORTH A SHOT."
01:29:14.016,01:29:15.851,WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET OUT OF HERE.
01:29:30.324,01:29:32.826,Cobb: YOU FEEL THAT?
01:29:32.868,01:29:35.578,"YOU'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TRAINED FOR THIS, MR. FISCHER."
01:29:35.620,01:29:38.248,PAY ATTENTION TO THE STRANGENESS OF THE WEATHER...
01:29:38.290,01:29:39.541,THE SHIFT IN GRAVITY.
01:29:39.582,01:29:41.335,NONE OF THIS IS REAL.
01:29:41.375,01:29:42.627,YOU'RE IN A DREAM.
01:29:46.882,01:29:52.221,"NOW, THE EASIEST WAY FOR YOU TO TEST YOURSELF IS TO TRY AND REMEMBER HOW YOU ARRIVED AT THIS HOTEL."
01:29:52.262,01:29:53.930,CAN YOU DO THAT?
01:29:53.972,01:29:56.474,"YEAH, I, I..."
01:29:56.516,01:29:58.685,"NOW, BREATHE, BREATHE."
01:29:58.727,01:30:02.272,"ACCEPT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE IN A DREAM, AND I'M HERE TO PROTECT YOU."
01:30:02.314,01:30:03.606,GO ON.
01:30:05.859,01:30:07.443,MM-HMM.
01:30:09.612,01:30:12.282,YOU'RE NOT REAL?
01:30:12.324,01:30:13.867,"NO, NO."
01:30:13.909,01:30:15.702,I'M A PROJECTION OF YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS.
01:30:15.744,01:30:21.083,I WAS SENT HERE TO PROTECT YOU IN THE EVENT THAT EXTRACTORS TRIED TO PULL YOU INTO A DREAM.
01:30:21.124,01:30:24.627,"AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW, MR. FISCHER."
01:30:24.669,01:30:26.046,YEAH.
01:30:26.088,01:30:28.173,OKAY.
01:30:28.215,01:30:31.301,OKAY.
01:30:32.928,01:30:34.054,CAN YOU GET ME OUT OF HERE?
01:30:34.096,01:30:36.306,RIGHT AWAY.
01:30:36.348,01:30:38.432,FOLLOW ME.
01:30:52.572,01:30:53.865,HOLD ON A SECOND!
01:30:58.912,01:31:00.872,JESUS CHRIST!
01:31:00.914,01:31:03.457,"THESE MEN WERE SENT HERE TO ABDUCT YOU, ALL RIGHT?"
01:31:03.499,01:31:06.002,"IF YOU WANT MY HELP, YOU HAVE TO REMAIN CALM."
01:31:07.170,01:31:09.839,"I NEED YOU TO WORK WITH ME, MR. FISCHER."
01:31:21.226,01:31:25.147,"IF THIS IS A DREAM, I SHOULD JUST KILL MYSELF TO WAKE UP, RIGHT?"
01:31:25.188,01:31:27.649,"I WOULDN'T DO THAT IF I WERE YOU, MR. FISCHER."
01:31:27.690,01:31:30.777,"I BELIEVE THEY HAVE YOU SEDATED, AND IF YOU PULL THAT TRIGGER..."
01:31:30.819,01:31:32.904,YOU MAY NOT WAKE UP.
01:31:32.946,01:31:35.573,YOU MAY GO INTO A FURTHER DREAM STATE.
01:31:35.615,01:31:38.160,"NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT."
01:31:38.201,01:31:42.164,YOU REMEMBER THE TRAINING.
01:31:42.205,01:31:44.582,REMEMBER WHAT I SAID TO YOU.
01:31:44.624,01:31:46.584,GIVE ME THE GUN.
01:31:58.472,01:31:59.806,THIS ROOM SHOULD BE DIRECTLY BELOW 528?
01:31:59.848,01:32:01.975,YEAH.
01:32:10.442,01:32:12.902,"THINK, MR. FISCHER, THINK."
01:32:12.944,01:32:15.364,WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER FROM BEFORE THIS DREAM?
01:32:15.405,01:32:17.115,"UH...THERE WAS, UM..."
01:32:17.157,01:32:18.783,THERE WAS A LOT OF GUNFIRE.
01:32:18.825,01:32:21.328,THERE WAS...RAIN.
01:32:21.370,01:32:23.913,UNCLE PETER.
01:32:23.955,01:32:25.832,"OH, MY GOD, WE'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED."
01:32:25.874,01:32:27.209,WHERE WERE THEY HOLDING YOU?
01:32:27.250,01:32:29.836,UH...
01:32:29.878,01:32:32.381,THEY HAD US IN THE BACK OF A VAN.
01:32:32.422,01:32:34.007,THAT EXPLAINS THE GRAVITY SHIFTS.
01:32:34.049,01:32:36.468,YOU'RE IN THE BACK OF A VAN RIGHT NOW. KEEP GOING.
01:32:36.510,01:32:39.012,"IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH, UM..."
01:32:39.054,01:32:42.682,SOMETHING TO DO WITH A...A SAFE?
01:32:42.724,01:32:44.767,"GOD, WHY IS IT SO HARD TO REMEMBER?"
01:32:44.809,01:32:47.854,IT'S LIKE TRYING TO REMEMBER A DREAM AFTER YOU'VE WOKEN UP.
01:32:47.896,01:32:49.898,"LISTEN, IT TAKES YEARS OF PRACTICE."
01:32:49.939,01:32:55.070,YOU AND BROWNING HAVE BEEN PULLED INTO THIS DREAM BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO STEAL SOMETHING FROM YOUR MIND.
01:32:55.111,01:32:58.698,I NEED YOU TO FOCUS AND TRY AND REMEMBER WHAT THAT IS.
01:32:58.740,01:33:00.158,"WHAT IS IT, MR. FISCHER?"
01:33:00.200,01:33:02.118,"OH, A C-COMBINATION."
01:33:02.160,01:33:04.578,THEY DEMANDED THE FIRST NUMBERS TO POP INTO MY HEAD.
01:33:04.620,01:33:07.249,THEY'RE TRYING TO EXTRACT A NUMBER FROM YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS.
01:33:07.290,01:33:08.791,IT CAN REPRESENT ANYTHING.
01:33:08.833,01:33:11.253,WE'RE IN A HOTEL RIGHT NOW.
01:33:11.294,01:33:12.754,WE SHOULD TRY HOTEL ROOMS.
01:33:12.795,01:33:15.131,"WHAT WAS THE NUMBER, MR. FISCHER?"
01:33:15.173,01:33:17.759,TRY AND REMEMBER FOR ME.
01:33:17.800,01:33:19.719,FIVE.
01:33:19.761,01:33:22.055,"FIVE, TWO..."
01:33:22.097,01:33:23.557,IT WAS A LONG NUMBER.
01:33:23.597,01:33:25.058,"WELL, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH."
01:33:25.100,01:33:26.600,YEP.
01:33:26.642,01:33:27.769,SO DO YOU USE A TIMER?
01:33:27.810,01:33:30.021,"NO, I HAVE TO JUDGE IT FOR MYSELF."
01:33:30.063,01:33:34.067,"WHILE YOU'RE ALL ASLEEP IN 528, I WAIT FOR YUSUF'S KICK."
01:33:34.109,01:33:36.528,"WELL, HOW WILL YOU KNOW?"
01:33:36.570,01:33:40.656,"AND THEN WHEN THE VAN HITS THE BARRIER OF THE BRIDGE, THAT SHOULD BE UNMISTAKABLE."
01:33:40.698,01:33:43.743,"SO WE GET A NICE, SYNCHRONIZED KICK."
01:33:43.785,01:33:46.829,"IF IT'S TOO SOON, WE WON'T GET PULLED OUT."
01:33:46.871,01:33:49.874,"BUT IF IT'S TOO LATE, I WON'T BE ABLE TO DROP US."
01:33:49.916,01:33:51.667,"WELL, WHY NOT?"
01:33:51.709,01:33:53.753,'CAUSE THE VAN WILL BE IN FREE FALL.
01:33:53.795,01:33:55.838,CAN'T DROP YOU WITHOUT GRAVITY.
01:33:55.880,01:33:57.299,RIGHT.
01:34:02.137,01:34:03.472,THEY'RE WITH ME.
01:34:03.513,01:34:04.764,GO ON.
01:34:28.955,01:34:30.582,MR. CHARLES.
01:34:30.624,01:34:32.125,"DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, MR. FISCHER?"
01:34:32.167,01:34:33.793,"YEAH, I-I THINK SO."
01:34:33.835,01:34:35.711,THEY WERE TRYING TO PUT YOU UNDER.
01:34:35.753,01:34:38.465,I'M ALREADY UNDER.
01:34:38.507,01:34:41.092,"WHAT DO YOU MEAN, A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM?"
01:34:41.134,01:34:44.179,HEY.
01:34:44.220,01:34:46.348,I'M SORRY?
01:34:46.389,01:34:48.933,"OH, I'M SORRY."
01:34:50.644,01:34:53.313,"WELL, GOOD-LOOKING FELLOW, I'M SURE."
01:34:53.355,01:34:54.439,AH.
01:34:54.481,01:34:56.107,"NO, NO, NO, NO."
01:34:56.149,01:34:58.026,THAT'S FISCHER'S PROJECTION OF BROWNING.
01:34:58.067,01:34:59.444,LET'S FOLLOW HIM AND SEE HOW HE BEHAVES.
01:34:59.486,01:35:00.945,WHY?
01:35:00.987,01:35:05.158,BECAUSE HOW HE ACTS WILL TELL US IF FISCHER IS STARTING TO SUSPECT HIS MOTIVES THE WAY WE WANT HIM TO.
01:35:05.200,01:35:06.535,Shh!
01:35:10.372,01:35:11.789,UNCLE PETER?
01:35:11.831,01:35:14.167,YOU SAID YOU WERE KIDNAPPED TOGETHER?
01:35:14.209,01:35:15.960,"WELL, N-NOT EXACTLY."
01:35:16.002,01:35:17.295,THEY WERE TORTURING HIM.
01:35:17.337,01:35:18.796,AND YOU SAW THEM TORTURE HIM?
01:35:25.887,01:35:28.348,THE KIDNAPPERS ARE WORKING FOR YOU?
01:35:28.390,01:35:30.808,"OH, ROBERT."
01:35:30.850,01:35:32.894,YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THAT SAFE OPEN?
01:35:32.935,01:35:34.812,TO GET THE ALTERNATE WILL?
01:35:34.854,01:35:37.357,FISCHER MORROW HAS BEEN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
01:35:37.399,01:35:39.359,I CAN'T LET YOU DESTROY IT.
01:35:39.401,01:35:42.028,I'M NOT GONNA THROW AWAY MY INHERITANCE! WHY WOULD I?!
01:35:42.070,01:35:46.199,I COULDN'T LET YOU RISE TO YOUR FATHER'S LAST TAUNT.
01:35:46.241,01:35:47.825,WHAT TAUNT?
01:35:47.867,01:35:49.994,"THE WILL, ROBERT."
01:35:50.036,01:35:51.871,THAT'S HIS LAST INSULT.
01:35:51.913,01:35:59.879,A CHALLENGE FOR YOU TO BUILD SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF BY TELLING YOU YOU'RE NOT WORTHY OF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
01:36:05.427,01:36:08.971,"WHAT, BUT THAT -- THAT HE WAS, UM, DISAPPOINTED?"
01:36:09.013,01:36:11.558,HMM?
01:36:11.600,01:36:13.435,BUT...
01:36:13.476,01:36:15.353,HE'S WRONG.
01:36:15.395,01:36:18.147,YOU CAN BUILD A BETTER COMPANY THAN HE EVER DID.
01:36:18.189,01:36:19.815,Cobb: MR. FISCHER?
01:36:19.857,01:36:21.401,HE'S LYING.
01:36:21.443,01:36:23.278,HOW DO YOU KNOW?
01:36:23.319,01:36:24.778,"TRUST ME, IT'S WHAT I DO."
01:36:23.319,01:36:26.281,"HE'S HIDING SOMETHING, AND WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT IS."
01:36:27.657,01:36:31.286,I NEED YOU TO DO THE SAME THING TO HIM THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO TO YOU.
01:36:33.747,01:36:36.999,WE'LL ENTER HIS SUBCONSCIOUS AND FIND OUT WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW.
01:36:38.460,01:36:40.002,ALL RIGHT.
01:36:45.925,01:36:48.094,HE'S OUT.
01:36:48.136,01:36:49.387,WHOSE SUBCONSCIOUS ARE WE GOING INTO EXACTLY?
01:36:49.429,01:36:50.972,WE'RE GOING INTO FISCHER'S.
01:36:51.013,01:36:54.726,BUT I TOLD HIM IT WAS BROWNING'S SO HE'D COME BE A PART OF OUR TEAM.
01:36:54.768,01:36:58.229,HE'S GONNA HELP US BREAK INTO HIS OWN SUBCONSCIOUS.
01:36:58.271,01:37:01.065,SECURITY'S GONNA RUN YOU DOWN HARD.
01:37:01.107,01:37:03.443,AND I WILL LEAD THEM ON A MERRY CHASE.
01:37:03.485,01:37:05.111,JUST BE BACK BEFORE THE KICK.
01:37:05.153,01:37:06.738,"GO TO SLEEP, MR. EAMES."
01:37:09.949,01:37:13.202,Arthur: YOU GOOD?
01:37:15.497,01:37:17.666,HEY. YOU READY?
01:37:17.707,01:37:19.250,"YES, YES."
01:37:19.292,01:37:20.876,I'M -- I'M READY.
01:37:32.639,01:37:35.099,Ariadne: COBB?
01:37:35.141,01:37:36.601,COBB.
01:37:36.643,01:37:37.935,WHAT'S DOWN THERE?
01:37:41.189,01:37:43.775,"HOPEFULLY, THE TRUTH WE WANT FISCHER TO LEARN."
01:37:43.817,01:37:46.027,"I MEAN, WHAT'S DOWN THERE FOR YOU?"
01:37:55.787,01:37:58.080,OHH!
01:38:19.394,01:38:20.978,WHOA!
01:38:42.584,01:38:43.585,OHH!
01:40:22.224,01:40:23.810,DID YOU SEE THAT?
01:40:42.704,01:40:45.122,"Cobb: EAMES, THIS IS YOUR DREAM."
01:40:45.164,01:40:46.916,I NEED YOU TO DRAW THE SECURITY AWAY FROM THE COMPLEX.
01:40:46.958,01:40:48.001,YOU UNDERSTAND?
01:40:48.041,01:40:49.293,WHO GUIDES FISCHER IN?
01:40:49.335,01:40:51.170,NOT ME.
01:40:51.212,01:40:52.964,"IF I KNOW THE ROUTE, EVERYTHING COULD BE COMPROMISED."
01:40:53.006,01:40:54.298,I-I DESIGNED THE PLACE.
01:40:54.340,01:40:55.633,"NO, YOU'RE WITH ME."
01:40:55.675,01:40:57.802,I COULD DO IT.
01:40:57.844,01:41:00.095,ALL RIGHT. YOU BRIEF HIM ON THE ROUTE INTO THE COMPLEX.
01:41:00.137,01:41:02.473,"FISCHER, YOU'LL BE GOING WITH HIM."
01:41:02.515,01:41:04.517,ALL RIGHT.
01:41:04.559,01:41:05.685,YOU KEEP THIS LIVE.
01:41:05.727,01:41:07.687,I'LL BE LISTENING IN THE WHOLE TIME.
01:41:07.729,01:41:11.482,THE WINDOWS ON THAT UPPER FLOOR ARE BIG ENOUGH FOR ME TO COVER YOU FROM THAT SOUTH TOWER. YOU SEE IT?
01:41:11.524,01:41:13.442,YEAH.
01:41:13.484,01:41:19.365,"IN ORDER TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR FATHER, YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO BREAK INTO BROWNING'S MIND ON YOUR OWN."
01:41:19.407,01:41:20.491,"COME ON, FISCHER!"
01:42:16.213,01:42:18.925,SOUND THE ALARM!
01:42:18.967,01:42:19.801,"GO, GO, GO!"
01:42:19.842,01:42:21.552,MOVE!
01:42:22.720,01:42:24.263,GO!
01:42:39.445,01:42:40.362,SOD IT!
01:42:51.206,01:42:53.459,I HOPE YOU'RE READY.
01:43:02.301,01:43:03.803,"NO, IT'S TOO SOON."
01:43:09.934,01:43:11.769,"COBB, DO YOU HEAR THAT?"
01:43:11.811,01:43:13.980,I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago.
01:43:14.022,01:43:15.397,I THOUGHT IT WAS THE WIND UP HERE.
01:43:15.439,01:43:17.900,"YEAH, I HEAR IT."
01:43:17.942,01:43:19.652,"SO, WHAT DO WE DO?"
01:43:19.694,01:43:21.278,WE MOVE FAST.
01:43:27.076,01:43:28.285,YUSUF IS 10 SECONDS FROM THE JUMP.
01:43:31.246,01:43:32.456,WHICH GIVES ARTHUR THREE MINUTES.
01:43:34.333,01:43:37.252,HEY!
01:43:37.294,01:43:39.130,WHICH GIVES US WHAT?
01:43:39.172,01:43:40.715,CAN THEY MAKE THAT ROUTE IN UNDER AN HOUR?
01:43:40.756,01:43:42.675,THEY STILL HAVE TO CLIMB DOWN TO THE MIDDLE TERRACE.
01:43:42.717,01:43:44.426,"WELL, THEN, THEY NEED A NEW ROUTE, A MORE DIRECT ROUTE."
01:43:56.522,01:43:57.732,IT'S DESIGNED AS A LABYRINTH.
01:43:57.773,01:44:00.818,"THERE MUST BE ACCESS ROUTES THAT CUT THROUGH THE MAZE, RIGHT?"
01:44:00.860,01:44:01.903,EAMES?
01:44:24.800,01:44:26.427,DID EAMES ADD ANY FEATURES?
01:44:26.468,01:44:27.887,I DON'T THINK I SHOULD TELL YOU.
01:44:27.929,01:44:29.805,"IF MAL FINDS OUT, THEN -- WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS!"
01:44:29.847,01:44:30.932,DID HE ADD ANYTHING?
01:44:32.391,01:44:34.351,HE ADDED AN AIR-DUCT SYSTEM THAT CAN CUT THROUGH THE MAZE.
01:44:34.393,01:44:35.853,GOOD.
01:44:35.895,01:44:36.979,Saito?
01:44:47.990,01:44:48.950,AH!
01:45:03.923,01:45:05.507,LOOK.
01:45:09.302,01:45:11.889,PARADOX.
01:46:21.834,01:46:24.086,WHAT WAS THAT?
01:46:24.128,01:46:26.463,"COBB! COBB, DID WE MISS IT?"
01:46:26.505,01:46:28.341,"YEAH, WE MISSED IT."
01:46:28.381,01:46:30.425,MAN.
01:46:30.467,01:46:33.637,COULDN'T SOMEONE HAVE DREAMT OF A GODDAMN BEACH?!
01:46:33.679,01:46:36.389,HUH?
01:46:36.431,01:46:37.892,EAMES: What the hell do we do now?!
01:46:37.933,01:46:41.562,WE FINISH THE JOB before the next kick.
01:46:41.603,01:46:43.314,WHEN THE VAN HITS THE WATER.
01:47:05.794,01:47:08.672,"Female computerized voice: IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A CALL, PLEASE HANG UP AND TRY AGAIN."
01:47:08.714,01:47:10.632,"IF YOU NEED HELP, HANG UP..."
01:47:10.674,01:47:14.553,HOW DO I DROP YOU WITHOUT GRAVITY?
01:47:17.098,01:47:19.516,"ARTHUR HAS A COUPLE MINUTES, AND WE HAVE ABOUT 20."
01:47:42.248,01:47:44.666,YOU OKAY?
01:47:48.796,01:47:51.882,Man: RUN! TURN AROUND!
01:47:51.924,01:47:54.135,MOVE TO BASE!
01:47:57.096,01:47:58.347,THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.
01:47:58.389,01:47:59.807,THEY'RE HEADING YOUR WAY LIKE THEY KNOW SOMETHING.
01:48:02.017,01:48:04.937,"JUST -- JUST BUY US MORE TIME, ALL RIGHT? COME ON!"
01:48:04.979,01:48:06.397,ON MY WAY.
01:48:06.439,01:48:07.940,Man: COME ON! MOVE!
01:49:45.913,01:49:48.832,THAT'S THE ANTECHAMBER OUTSIDE THE STRONG ROOM.
01:49:48.874,01:49:50.834,DOES THE STRONG ROOM HAVE ANY WINDOWS?
01:49:50.876,01:49:52.669,"NO, I MEAN, IT WOULDN'T BE VERY STRONG IF IT DID."
01:49:52.711,01:49:54.629,"WELL, LET'S HOPE FISCHER LIKES WHAT HE FINDS IN THERE."
01:49:56.549,01:49:58.591,ARE THOSE PROJECTIONS JUST A PART OF HIS SUBCONSCIOUS?
01:49:58.633,01:50:00.428,YES.
01:50:00.469,01:50:02.012,ARE YOU DESTROYING THOSE PARTS OF HIS MIND?
01:50:02.054,01:50:03.264,"NO, NO."
01:50:29.290,01:50:30.665,WE'RE HERE.
01:50:30.707,01:50:32.126,"YOU'RE CLEAR, BUT HURRY."
01:50:32.167,01:50:33.335,THERE'S AN ENTIRE ARMY HEADED YOUR WAY.
01:50:59.403,01:51:01.155,I'M IN.
01:51:06.743,01:51:07.828,THERE HE IS!
01:51:50.663,01:51:51.997,THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE IN THERE.
01:51:52.039,01:51:53.165,"FISCHER, IT'S A TRAP."
01:51:54.542,01:51:56.793,COME ON.
01:52:02.174,01:52:05.177,COBB. NO.
01:52:05.219,01:52:07.221,SHE -- SHE IS NOT REAL.
01:52:07.262,01:52:09.014,HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
01:52:09.056,01:52:10.641,SHE'S JUST A PROJECTION.
01:52:10.683,01:52:12.725,FISCHER.
01:52:16.438,01:52:18.899,HELLO.
01:52:22.861,01:52:25.989,"EAMES! EAMES, GET TO THE ANTECHAMBER NOW!"
01:53:09.617,01:53:10.618,WHAT HAPPENED?
01:53:10.659,01:53:13.412,MAL KILLED FISCHER.
01:53:15.205,01:53:17.416,I COULDN'T SHOOT HER.
01:53:17.458,01:53:19.376,"LOOK, THERE'S NO USE IN REVIVING HIM."
01:53:19.418,01:53:21.420,HIS MIND'S ALREADY TRAPPED DOWN THERE.
01:53:21.462,01:53:22.713,IT'S ALL OVER.
01:53:22.755,01:53:25.966,"SO THAT'S IT, THEN?"
01:53:26.007,01:53:28.677,WE'RE DONE. I'M SORRY.
01:53:32.681,01:53:34.683,"WELL, IT'S NOT ME THAT DOESN'T GET BACK TO MY FAMILY, IS IT?"
01:53:35.684,01:53:37.144,IT'S A SHAME.
01:53:35.684,01:53:40.021,I REALLY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN IN THERE.
01:53:40.063,01:53:41.231,LET'S SET THE CHARGES.
01:53:43.858,01:53:45.193,"NO, THERE'S STILL ANOTHER WAY."
01:53:46.320,01:53:48.322,WE JUST HAVE TO FOLLOW FISCHER DOWN THERE.
01:53:48.363,01:53:50.449,NOT ENOUGH TIME.
01:53:50.491,01:53:54.119,"NO, BUT THERE WILL BE ENOUGH TIME DOWN THERE."
01:53:54.161,01:53:55.704,AND WE WILL FIND HIM.
01:53:55.746,01:53:59.916,"OKAY, AS SOON AS ARTHUR'S MUSIC KICKS IN, JUST USE THE DEFIBRILLATOR TO REVIVE HIM."
01:53:59.958,01:54:02.670,WE CAN GIVE HIM HIS OWN KICK DOWN BELOW.
01:54:02.711,01:54:04.630,"LOOK, YOU GET HIM IN THERE."
01:54:04.672,01:54:11.679,"AS SOON AS THE MUSIC ENDS, YOU BLOW UP THE HOSPITAL, AND WE ALL RIDE THE KICK BACK UP THE LAYERS."
01:54:11.720,01:54:17.309,"WELL, IT'S WORTH A SHOT, IF SAITO CAN HOLD THE GUARDS OFF WHILE I SET THE CHARGES."
01:54:17.351,01:54:18.893,"SAITO WILL NEVER MAKE IT, WILL HE?"
01:54:20.895,01:54:22.606,"COBB, COME ON."
01:54:22.648,01:54:24.316,GO FOR IT.
01:54:24.358,01:54:27.486,"BUT IF YOU ARE NOT BACK BEFORE THE KICK, I AM GONE WITH OR WITHOUT YOU."
01:54:27.528,01:54:28.903,SHE'S RIGHT.
01:54:33.950,01:54:36.453,CAN I TRUST YOU TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN HERE?
01:54:36.495,01:54:38.455,"I MEAN, MAL'S GONNA BE DOWN THERE."
01:54:38.497,01:54:40.499,I KNOW WHERE TO FIND HER.
01:54:40.541,01:54:41.583,HOW DO YOU KNOW?
01:54:41.625,01:54:44.336,"BECAUSE, SHE WANTS ME TO COME AFTER HIM."
01:54:44.378,01:54:47.130,SHE WANTS ME BACK DOWN THERE WITH HER.
01:55:13.657,01:55:15.116,YOU ALL RIGHT?
01:55:21.456,01:55:23.458,THIS IS YOUR WORLD?
01:55:23.500,01:55:25.711,IT WAS.
01:55:25.753,01:55:27.796,THIS IS WHERE SHE'LL BE.
01:55:27.838,01:55:30.424,COME ON.
01:56:15.385,01:56:17.429,SAITO.
01:56:17.471,01:56:20.265,SAITO.
01:56:20.307,01:56:23.560,"I NEED YOU -- I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF FISCHER WHILE I GO SET SOME CHARGES, OKAY?"
01:56:23.602,01:56:25.479,NO ROOM FOR TOURISTS ON THESE JOBS.
01:56:29.650,01:56:30.692,DON'T BE SILLY.
01:57:02.432,01:57:05.477,Ariadne: YOU BUILT ALL THIS?
01:57:05.519,01:57:06.812,THIS IS INCREDIBLE.
01:57:06.854,01:57:08.313,WE BUILT FOR YEARS.
01:57:08.355,01:57:10.858,THEN WE STARTED IN ON THE MEMORIES.
01:57:17.739,01:57:19.825,THIS WAY.
01:58:00.699,01:58:02.534,THIS WAS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.
01:58:02.576,01:58:05.787,PLACES FROM OUR PAST.
01:58:05.829,01:58:07.789,THAT WAS OUR FIRST APARTMENT.
01:58:07.831,01:58:10.124,THEN WE MOVED TO THAT BUILDING RIGHT THERE.
01:58:10.166,01:58:12.753,"AFTER MAL BECAME PREGNANT, THAT BECAME OUR HOME."
01:58:12.794,01:58:15.296,YOU RECONSTRUCTED ALL OF THIS FROM MEMORY?
01:58:15.338,01:58:17.716,"LIKE I TOLD YOU, WE HAD LOTS OF TIME."
01:58:17.758,01:58:19.300,WHAT IS THAT?
01:58:19.342,01:58:22.679,THAT'S THE HOUSE MAL GREW UP IN.
01:58:22.721,01:58:24.305,"WELL, WILL SHE BE IN THERE?"
01:58:24.347,01:58:27.392,NO. COME ON.
01:58:27.434,01:58:30.771,"WE BOTH WANTED TO LIVE IN A HOUSE, BUT WE LOVED THIS TYPE OF BUILDING."
01:58:30.812,01:58:33.982,"IN THE REAL WORLD, WE'D HAVE TO CHOOSE, BUT NOT HERE."
01:59:14.439,01:59:16.650,HOW ARE WE GONNA BRING FISCHER BACK?
01:59:16.691,01:59:19.193,WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF A KICK.
01:59:19.235,01:59:21.113,WHAT?
01:59:21.154,01:59:23.031,I'M GONNA IMPROVISE.
01:59:23.073,01:59:25.325,"LISTEN, THERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ME."
01:59:25.366,01:59:27.285,ABOUT INCEPTION.
01:59:39.923,01:59:42.926,AN IDEA IS LIKE A VIRUS.
01:59:42.968,01:59:44.803,RESILIENT.
01:59:44.845,01:59:47.263,HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS.
01:59:47.305,01:59:50.684,AND THE SMALLEST SEED OF AN IDEA CAN GROW.
01:59:50.725,01:59:53.854,IT CAN GROW TO DEFINE...
01:59:53.895,01:59:56.773,OR DESTROY YOU.
01:59:58.900,02:00:02.654,"THE SMALLEST IDEA, SUCH AS..."
02:00:02.696,02:00:06.116,YOUR WORLD IS NOT REAL.
02:00:06.158,02:00:09.410,SIMPLE LITTLE THOUGHT THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING.
02:00:09.452,02:00:12.998,SO CERTAIN OF YOUR WORLD.
02:00:13.040,02:00:15.167,OF WHAT'S REAL.
02:00:15.208,02:00:17.669,DO YOU THINK HE IS?
02:00:17.711,02:00:22.049,OR DO YOU THINK HE'S AS LOST AS I WAS?
02:00:22.090,02:00:24.092,"I KNOW WHAT'S REAL, MAL."
02:00:26.636,02:00:28.304,NO CREEPING DOUBTS?
02:00:28.346,02:00:31.265,"NOT FEELING PERSECUTED, DOM?"
02:00:31.307,02:00:35.896,CHASED AROUND THE GLOBE BY ANONYMOUS CORPORATIONS AND POLICE FORCES?
02:00:35.937,02:00:39.107,THE WAY THE PROJECTIONS PERSECUTE THE DREAMER?
02:00:39.149,02:00:42.736,ADMIT IT.
02:00:42.777,02:00:45.822,YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ONE REALITY ANYMORE.
02:00:45.864,02:00:48.033,SO CHOOSE.
02:00:48.075,02:00:50.284,CHOOSE TO BE HERE.
02:00:50.326,02:00:52.620,CHOOSE ME.
02:00:55.165,02:00:57.625,AAH!
02:00:57.667,02:00:58.710,UNH!
02:01:17.520,02:01:19.355,YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
02:01:19.397,02:01:22.525,I HAVE TO GET BACK TO OUR CHILDREN BECAUSE YOU LEFT THEM.
02:01:22.567,02:01:25.361,BECAUSE YOU LEFT US.
02:01:25.403,02:01:27.280,YOU'RE WRONG.
02:01:27.321,02:01:29.699,YOU'RE CONFUSED.
02:01:29.741,02:01:33.536,OUR CHILDREN ARE HERE.
02:01:33.578,02:01:35.747,"AND YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THEIR FACES AGAIN, WOULDN'T YOU?"
02:01:35.789,02:01:37.540,YES...
02:01:37.582,02:01:39.876,"BUT I'M GONNA SEE THEM UP ABOVE, MAL."
02:01:53.056,02:01:55.683,UP ABOVE?
02:01:55.725,02:01:58.103,LISTEN TO YOURSELF.
02:01:58.145,02:02:00.105,THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN.
02:02:00.147,02:02:02.149,WATCH.
02:02:02.190,02:02:03.984,JAMES? PHILLIPA?
02:02:04.025,02:02:06.194,"DON'T DO THIS, MAL."
02:02:06.236,02:02:07.612,THOSE AREN'T MY CHILDREN.
02:02:07.654,02:02:10.782,"YOU KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT, BUT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT."
02:02:10.824,02:02:14.911,AND WHAT IF YOU'RE WRONG?
02:02:14.953,02:02:17.789,YOU KEEP TELLING YOURSELF WHAT YOU KNOW.
02:02:17.831,02:02:21.793,BUT WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE?
02:02:21.835,02:02:23.795,WHAT DO YOU FEEL?
02:02:23.837,02:02:27.423,GUILT.
02:02:27.465,02:02:29.843,"I FEEL GUILT, MAL."
02:02:29.884,02:02:32.720,"AND NO MATTER WHAT I DO, NO..."
02:02:32.762,02:02:42.022,"NO MATTER HOW HOPELESS I AM, NO MATTER HOW CONFUSED, THAT GUILT IS ALWAYS THERE, REMINDING ME OF THE TRUTH."
02:02:42.063,02:02:44.398,WHAT TRUTH?
02:02:46.026,02:02:52.157,THAT THE IDEA THAT CAUSED YOU TO QUESTION YOUR REALITY CAME FROM ME.
02:02:54.450,02:02:58.330,YOU PLANTED THE IDEA IN MY MIND?
02:02:58.371,02:03:01.582,WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?
02:03:01.624,02:03:07.547,THE REASON I KNEW INCEPTION WAS POSSIBLE WAS BECAUSE I...
02:03:07.588,02:03:09.841,I DID IT TO MY OWN WIFE.
02:03:09.883,02:03:11.551,WHY?
02:03:11.592,02:03:14.054,WE WERE LOST IN HERE.
02:03:14.095,02:03:19.475,"I KNEW WE NEEDED TO ESCAPE, BUT SHE WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT."
02:03:22.312,02:03:28.401,"SHE HAD LOCKED SOMETHING AWAY, SOMETHING..."
02:03:28.442,02:03:33.614,"THAT TRUTH THAT SHE HAD ONCE KNOWN, BUT CHOSE TO FORGET."
02:03:33.656,02:03:36.076,AND SHE COULDN'T BREAK FREE.
02:03:38.494,02:03:42.207,SO I DECIDED TO SEARCH FOR IT.
02:03:42.249,02:03:47.503,I WENT DEEP INTO THE RECESS OF HER MIND AND FOUND THAT SECRET PLACE.
02:03:47.545,02:03:49.297,AND I BROKE IN...
02:03:49.339,02:03:52.425,AND I PLANTED AN IDEA.
02:03:52.466,02:03:55.595,A SIMPLE LITTLE IDEA THAT WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING...
02:04:01.184,02:04:04.229,...THAT HER WORLD WASN'T REAL.
02:04:15.740,02:04:19.827,THAT DEATH WAS THE ONLY ESCAPE.
02:04:26.500,02:04:28.544,YOU'RE WAITING FOR A TRAIN.
02:04:30.422,02:04:34.134,A TRAIN THAT'LL TAKE YOU FAR AWAY.
02:04:34.175,02:04:37.345,YOU KNOW WHERE YOU HOPE THIS TRAIN WILL TAKE YOU.
02:04:39.806,02:04:41.933,BUT YOU CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE!
02:04:43.143,02:04:44.394,YET IT DOESN'T MATTER!
02:04:44.436,02:04:46.896,"NOW, TELL ME WHY!"
02:04:46.938,02:04:48.648,BECAUSE YOU'LL BE TOGETHER!
02:04:52.819,02:04:59.909,"BUT I NEVER KNEW THAT THAT IDEA WOULD GROW IN HER MIND LIKE A CANCER, THAT EVEN AFTER SHE WOKE...."
02:05:02.829,02:05:04.998,THAT EVEN AFTER YOU CAME BACK TO REALITY...
02:05:08.376,02:05:10.920,...THAT YOU'D CONTINUE TO BELIEVE YOUR WORLD WASN'T REAL.
02:05:13.756,02:05:16.176,THAT DEATH WAS THE ONLY ESCAPE.
02:05:16.217,02:05:19.220,"MAL, NO! JESUS!"
02:05:19.262,02:05:21.473,YOU INFECTED MY MIND.
02:05:21.514,02:05:23.099,I WAS TRYING TO SAVE YOU.
02:05:23.141,02:05:24.517,YOU BETRAYED ME.
02:05:24.558,02:05:26.936,BUT YOU CAN MAKE AMENDS.
02:05:26.978,02:05:28.813,YOU CAN STILL KEEP YOUR PROMISE.
02:05:28.855,02:05:34.694,"WE CAN STILL BE TOGETHER, RIGHT HERE, IN THE WORLD WE BUILT TOGETHER."
02:06:56.901,02:06:58.570,"COBB, WE NEED TO GET FISCHER."
02:06:58.611,02:07:00.405,YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM.
02:07:00.447,02:07:03.408,"IF I STAY HERE, WILL YOU LET HIM GO?"
02:07:03.450,02:07:04.658,WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
02:07:08.413,02:07:11.082,FISCHER IS ON THE PORCH.
02:07:11.124,02:07:12.584,"GO CHECK HE'S ALIVE, ARIADNE."
02:07:12.625,02:07:14.294,"COBB, YOU CAN'T DO THIS."
02:07:14.335,02:07:17.338,GO CHECK HE'S ALIVE RIGHT NOW.
02:07:33.354,02:07:35.982,"HE'S HERE! AND IT'S TIME, BUT YOU HAVE TO COME NOW!"
02:07:36.023,02:07:37.691,"TAKE FISCHER WITH YOU, ALL RIGHT?"
02:07:37.733,02:07:39.486,YOU CAN'T STAY HERE TO BE WITH HER.
02:07:41.321,02:07:43.323,I'M NOT.
02:07:43.364,02:07:45.116,SAITO'S DEAD BY NOW.
02:07:45.158,02:07:46.742,THAT MEANS HE'S DOWN HERE SOMEWHERE.
02:07:46.784,02:07:48.453,THAT MEANS I HAVE TO FIND HIM.
02:07:50.413,02:07:53.874,I CAN'T STAY WITH HER ANYMORE BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T EXIST.
02:07:53.916,02:07:57.295,I'M THE ONLY THING YOU DO BELIEVE IN ANYMORE.
02:07:58.879,02:08:02.049,I WISH.
02:08:02.091,02:08:07.221,"I WISH MORE THAN ANYTHING, BUT..."
02:08:07.263,02:08:11.976,"I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU WITH ALL YOUR COMPLEXITY, ALL YOUR PERFECTION, ALL YOUR IMPERFECTION."
02:08:12.018,02:08:14.145,YOU ALL RIGHT?
02:08:14.187,02:08:16.523,LOOK AT YOU.
02:08:16.564,02:08:18.816,YOU'RE JUST A SHADE.
02:08:18.858,02:08:22.362,YOU'RE JUST A SHADE OF MY REAL WIFE.
02:08:22.403,02:08:25.198,"AND YOU WERE THE BEST THAT I COULD DO, BUT..."
02:08:25.239,02:08:28.784,"I'M SORRY, YOU'RE JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH."
02:08:28.826,02:08:31.120,DOES THIS FEEL REAL?!
02:08:32.872,02:08:35.208,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
02:08:43.924,02:08:46.719,"NO, NO! NO!"
02:08:46.760,02:08:49.805,"IN THERE, NOW."
02:09:32.599,02:09:36.561,I WAS DIS...
02:09:36.603,02:09:40.273,I WAS DIS-- DISA...
02:09:40.314,02:09:41.566,"I KNOW, DAD."
02:09:41.608,02:09:43.067,DISA...
02:09:48.448,02:09:53.453,I KNOW YOU WERE DISAPPOINTED I COULDN'T BE YOU.
02:09:53.494,02:09:55.079,NO.
02:09:55.121,02:09:57.457,"NO, NO, NO."
02:09:57.498,02:10:01.001,I WAS DISAPPOINTED...
02:10:01.043,02:10:03.837,THAT YOU TRIED.
02:11:49.402,02:11:51.278,"THAT'S THE KICK, ARIADNE!"
02:11:51.320,02:11:52.363,YOU HAVE TO GO NOW!
02:12:05.585,02:12:08.755,DON'T LOSE YOURSELF!
02:12:08.796,02:12:09.963,I WILL!
02:12:50.003,02:12:52.965,WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO MARRY YOU?
02:12:53.006,02:12:55.008,YES.
02:12:55.050,02:12:58.011,YOU SAID YOU DREAMT THAT WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER.
02:12:59.972,02:13:02.349,BUT WE DID.
02:13:02.391,02:13:05.060,WE DID.
02:13:05.102,02:13:07.271,YOU DON'T REMEMBER?
02:13:10.316,02:13:15.154,"I MISS YOU MORE THAN I CAN BEAR, BUT..."
02:13:15.195,02:13:19.074,WE HAD OUR TIME TOGETHER.
02:13:19.116,02:13:22.578,AND I HAVE TO LET YOU GO.
02:13:22.620,02:13:27.040,I HAVE TO LET YOU GO.
02:14:16.382,02:14:18.300,"I'M SORRY, ROBERT."
02:14:45.118,02:14:49.874,"YOU KNOW, THE WILL MEANS THAT DAD WANTED ME TO BE MY OWN MAN..."
02:14:49.916,02:14:53.502,NOT JUST TO LIVE FOR HIM.
02:14:53.544,02:14:57.506,"THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO, UNCLE PETER."
02:15:05.932,02:15:07.516,WHAT HAPPENED?
02:15:07.558,02:15:08.642,COBB STAYED.
02:15:08.684,02:15:10.061,WITH MAL?
02:15:10.102,02:15:11.270,"NO, TO FIND SAITO."
02:15:13.188,02:15:14.523,HE'LL BE LOST.
02:15:17.109,02:15:19.278,"NO, HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT."
02:15:34.835,02:15:37.755,Saito: HAVE YOU COME TO KILL ME?
02:15:41.968,02:15:44.053,I'M WAITING FOR SOMEONE.
02:15:49.182,02:15:51.560,SOMEONE FROM A HALF-REMEMBERED DREAM.
02:15:53.771,02:15:56.107,COBB?
02:15:57.858,02:15:59.610,IMPOSSIBLE.
02:15:59.652,02:16:03.864,WE WERE YOUNG MEN TOGETHER.
02:16:03.906,02:16:07.034,I'M AN OLD MAN.
02:16:07.076,02:16:10.454,FILLED WITH REGRET.
02:16:12.873,02:16:17.544,WAITING TO DIE ALONE.
02:16:17.586,02:16:20.965,I'VE COME BACK FOR YOU.
02:16:23.634,02:16:27.847,TO REMIND YOU...
02:16:30.891,02:16:35.312,SOMETHING YOU ONCE KNEW.
02:16:35.354,02:16:39.066,THAT THIS WORLD IS NOT REAL.
02:16:43.737,02:16:48.617,TO CONVINCE ME TO HONOR OUR ARRANGEMENT?
02:16:48.659,02:16:52.079,"TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH, YES."
02:16:57.501,02:16:59.419,COME BACK...
02:17:01.547,02:17:05.592,...SO WE CAN BE YOUNG MEN TOGETHER AGAIN.
02:17:08.428,02:17:10.389,COME BACK WITH ME.
02:17:13.767,02:17:15.602,COME BACK.
02:17:24.904,02:17:27.239,"Flight attendant: HOT TOWEL, SIR?"
02:17:27.280,02:17:30.951,WE'LL BE LANDING IN LOS ANGELES IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES.
02:17:30.993,02:17:33.495,DO YOU NEED IMMIGRATION FORMS?
02:17:34.538,02:17:36.707,THANK YOU.
02:17:36.749,02:17:39.043,"HOT TOWEL, SIR?"
02:17:39.085,02:17:40.502,"UH, NO."
02:17:40.544,02:17:42.295,DO YOU NEED IMMIGRATION FORMS?
02:18:53.284,02:18:55.161,"WELCOME HOME, MR. COBB."
02:18:55.202,02:18:57.163,"THANK YOU, SIR."
02:19:41.081,02:19:43.375,WELCOME.
02:19:43.416,02:19:45.169,THIS WAY.
02:20:06.273,02:20:09.693,JAMES? PHILLIPA?
02:20:12.863,02:20:14.698,LOOK WHO'S HERE.
02:20:19.119,02:20:21.621,HEY.
02:20:21.663,02:20:23.874,"HEY, GUYS!"
02:20:23.916,02:20:25.918,HEY! HOW ARE YOU?

02:20:30.256,02:20:32.132,WHAT ARE YOU BUILDING?
02:20:32.174,02:20:34.093,WE'RE BUILDING A HOUSE ON THE CLIFF!
02:20:34.134,02:20:35.886,ON THE CLIFF?
02:20:35.928,02:20:38.055,"COME ON, I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME."
