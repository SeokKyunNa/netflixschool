00:01:44.229,00:01:45.188,YOU MEANT TO DO THAT!
00:01:45.230,00:01:46.273,"NO, YOU STARTLED ME."
00:01:46.314,00:01:47.441,"YEAH, YOU MEANT TO DO THAT."
00:01:47.482,00:01:49.902,"S-- NO, I DON'T THINK I DID."
00:01:49.944,00:01:52.654,"LISTEN, THIS WASN'T SOME WEST ENGLEWOOD DRUG SWEEP."
00:01:52.696,00:01:53.822,THE SEARCH WAS GOOD.
00:01:53.864,00:01:55.991,THERE'S NO CHANCE CARTER TOSSES IT.
00:01:56.033,00:01:58.660,WILL YOU CALM DOWN?
00:01:58.702,00:01:59.995,"WHAT, SO YOU CAN SMEAR ME?"
00:02:00.037,00:02:01.914,IMPLY THAT I INVENTED A PHANTOM WITNESS?
00:02:01.956,00:02:03.498,DID YOU?
00:02:01.956,00:02:05.417,"THE -- THE JADED LAWYER WITH NO, UH, NO RESPECT FOR THE LAW."
00:02:05.459,00:02:07.002,THAT'S ORIGINAL.
00:02:07.044,00:02:08.587,I RESPECT THE LAW JUST FINE.
00:02:08.629,00:02:10.047,I'M JUST NOT IN AWE OF IT.
00:02:10.089,00:02:11.548,I'M NOT ENCUMBERED BY IT.
00:02:11.590,00:02:18.138,"IF THE GREAT STATE OF ILLINOIS CAN'T MEET ITS BURDEN OF PROOF, IF I WALK WITH A GUILTY CLIENT, IT'S ON YOU."
00:02:18.179,00:02:20.432,"SO I SUGGEST YOU DO YOUR JOB, KATTAN."
00:02:20.474,00:02:25.228,"NOW, IF YOU'D LIKE TO FINISH THAT CLICHÃ©, YOU FOLLOWED ME INTO THE PISSER TO UNLOAD."
00:02:25.270,00:02:26.563,DID IT INVOLVE MY REFLECTION?
00:02:26.605,00:02:28.732,"MAYBE SLEEPING AT NIGHT, HOW DO I DO IT?"
00:02:28.774,00:02:31.986,I DO IT ON A TEMPUR-PEDIC BED...
00:02:32.027,00:02:33.654,...IN A HIGHLAND PARK HOME...
00:02:33.695,00:02:35.322,WITH A FERRARI IN THE DRIVEWAY...
00:02:35.363,00:02:38.575,NEXT TO A LOVING WIFE WITH THE ASS OF A HIGH SCHOOL VOLLEYBALLER.
00:02:38.617,00:02:45.124,"AND -- AND -- AND HOW DOES IT FEEL, HANK, KNOWING EVERY PERSON YOU REPRESENT IS GUILTY?"
00:02:45.165,00:02:47.375,IT'S FINE.
00:02:47.417,00:02:49.336,INNOCENT PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD ME.
00:02:50.629,00:02:53.256,"BURDEN OF PROOF, KATTAN."
00:02:53.298,00:02:54.967,"Man: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT."
00:02:55.009,00:02:56.927,YOU SAID THIS WOULDN'T GO TO TRIAL.
00:02:56.969,00:02:58.470,"I'M SORRY, DID I SAY THAT?"
00:02:58.512,00:03:00.305,I HIRED YOU TO MAKE THIS GO AWAY.
00:03:00.347,00:03:06.269,WRONG. YOU HIRED ME BECAUSE WE BOTH KNOW YOU WOULDN'T LAST TWO DAYS IN A FEDERAL PENITENTIARY.
00:03:06.311,00:03:08.313,STOP TELLING ME HOW TO DO MY JOB.
00:03:08.355,00:03:15.362,"DO I TELL YOU HOW TO COMMIT FRAUD, DENY COVERAGE TO TERMINALLY ILL POLICY HOLDERS OR EMBEZZLE $140 MILLION WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?"
00:03:15.403,00:03:18.281,I WOULDN'T DO THAT 'CAUSE THAT'S YOUR GIG.
00:03:18.323,00:03:19.658,THAT'S YOUR FORTE.
00:03:19.700,00:03:21.284,I'M HEARING YOU.
00:03:21.326,00:03:22.870,I'M GLAD.
00:03:28.834,00:03:31.336,Gus: ALL RISE.
00:03:31.378,00:03:33.212,COURT IS IN SESSION.
00:03:33.254,00:03:35.423,THE HONORABLE JUDGE STANLEY CARTER PRESIDING.

00:03:38.259,00:03:42.347,"Judge: BEFORE I RULE ON THE DEFENSE MOTION, IS THERE ANYTHING EITHER COUNSEL WOULD CARE TO ADD?"
00:03:42.389,00:03:44.516,"Kattan: YES, YOUR HONOR."
00:03:44.558,00:03:47.936,WE WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE ANY DOUBT AS TO THE VALIDITY OF OUR SEARCH.
00:03:47.978,00:03:52.649,"YOUR -- YOUR HONOR, CAN I...APPROACH, YOUR HONOR?"
00:03:59.907,00:04:02.283,"UH, I NEED A CONTINUANCE."
00:04:02.325,00:04:05.162,ABSOLUTELY NOT!
00:04:06.747,00:04:09.583,MY MOM PASSED AWAY THIS MORNING.
00:04:09.624,00:04:11.168,Kattan: MY ASS.
00:04:12.711,00:04:14.546,I'LL REPLAY IT.
00:04:16.715,00:04:21.762,"IS THIS THE FIRST TIME YOUR MOM PASSED AWAY, OR IS THIS SOMETHING YOU DO ON ALL THE CASES YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE?"
00:04:23.555,00:04:25.099,I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
00:04:25.140,00:04:26.975,THANK YOU.
00:04:27.017,00:04:28.476,WHAT A SCHMUCK YOU ARE.
00:04:30.353,00:04:33.023,"YOU KNOW, HE -- HE PEED ON ME."
00:04:33.065,00:04:36.484,JUST NOW IN THE RESTROOM.
00:04:36.526,00:04:37.945,"KATTAN, STEP AWAY."
00:04:37.986,00:04:40.530,"Lauren: DADDY, ARE YOU SAD ABOUT YOUR MOM?"
00:04:40.572,00:04:43.117,"YEAH, BABY."
00:04:44.576,00:04:46.828,WHY CAN'T I GO WITH YOU?
00:04:46.870,00:04:49.873,'CAUSE IT'S DEPRESSING.
00:04:49.915,00:04:53.334,"SO, GRANDPA PALMER'S DEAD, TOO?"
00:04:53.376,00:04:55.295,"NO, GRANDPA PALMER'S DEAD TO ME."
00:04:55.336,00:04:57.547,THAT'S LIKE A FIGURE OF SPEECH.
00:04:57.589,00:05:00.341,YOU MIGHT HAVE MISHEARD SOMETHING I SAID.
00:05:00.383,00:05:03.220,SOUNDS COMPLICATED.
00:05:03.262,00:05:04.512,TRUST ME.
00:05:04.554,00:05:07.099,"NOBODY WANTS TO GO TO CARLINVILLE, INDIANA."
00:05:07.141,00:05:09.601,EVERYBODY WANTS TO LEAVE.
00:05:15.107,00:05:17.525,YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?
00:05:17.567,00:05:19.987,HMM?

00:05:26.076,00:05:27.452,"I LOVE YOU, BABY."
00:05:27.494,00:05:30.164,DON'T EAT IT BEFORE BREAKFAST.
00:05:31.372,00:05:33.959,GOT YOU.

00:05:42.301,00:05:44.343,I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD -- LOU SHRUBNER.
00:05:44.385,00:05:46.429,IS THAT YOUR DIVORCE ATTORNEY?
00:05:46.471,00:05:49.266,HE'S GOOD.
00:05:49.308,00:05:51.977,"SHE'LL BE LIVING WITH ME, BY THE WAY."
00:05:52.019,00:05:53.603,HANK.

00:06:00.694,00:06:02.029,BROWNIE MEETINGS ARE WHICH NIGHT?

00:06:06.033,00:06:07.326,WHAT DOES SHE EAT FOR BREAKFAST?
00:06:07.366,00:06:09.161,DO YOU EVEN KNOW HER PEDIATRICIAN'S NAME?
00:06:09.203,00:06:11.412,HIS PHONE NUMBER?
00:06:11.454,00:06:13.748,I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU PUNISH HER FOR THIS.
00:06:13.790,00:06:15.416,"OKAY, SHE UNDERSTANDS."
00:06:15.458,00:06:19.046,SHE KNOWS IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT HER DADDY'S NEVER HOME BEFORE HER BEDTIME.
00:06:19.087,00:06:21.089,ON HIS PHONE ON THE WEEKENDS.
00:06:21.131,00:06:23.967,SHE KNOWS THAT IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT HER MOM IS SAD ALL THE TIME.
00:06:24.009,00:06:25.468,SAD? YOU'RE SAD?
00:06:25.510,00:06:27.095,YES!
00:06:27.137,00:06:33.352,"I'M SORRY YOU FELT SO SAD, YOU GOT ON FACEBOOK, FRIENDED YOUR OLD GORE-TEX-WEARING COLLEGE BUDDY JOSH AND FUCKED HIM."
00:06:33.392,00:06:35.062,HE'S SO RUGGED.
00:06:35.103,00:06:36.604,HE'S SO WISE.
00:06:36.646,00:06:39.566,I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE NOT HANGING OFF A MOUNTAIN WITH HIM IN A NET RIGHT NOW.
00:06:45.739,00:06:47.741,WANT TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME?

00:10:19.077,00:10:21.413,HER HEART JUST KIND OF TURNED OFF.
00:10:26.376,00:10:29.254,I FOUND HER BY THE HYDRANGEAS.
00:10:29.296,00:10:31.131,GOOD JOB.

00:10:52.026,00:10:54.654,IRELAND?
00:10:54.695,00:10:57.907,"SNAKES ARE YOUR CONSTANT, BUT ST. PATRICK, NOT ST. FRANCIS."
00:10:57.949,00:11:00.827,"AND IT WAS IRELAND, NOT INDIANA."
00:11:00.868,00:11:04.080,"TRUST ME, NO ONE IS DISPERSING REPTILES IN INDIANA."
00:11:05.706,00:11:07.000,WERE YOU THERE?
00:11:07.041,00:11:08.502,I WAS NOT THERE.

00:11:29.648,00:11:34.944,I PARKED UP -- TRIED TO GET A SPACE IN THE BIG LOT.
00:11:34.986,00:11:37.280,"I HAD TO GO AROUND, BUT I EVENTUALLY FOUND ONE."
00:11:37.322,00:11:38.823,HERE YOU GO.
00:11:40.241,00:11:41.742,WHERE'S THE FAMILY?
00:11:41.784,00:11:43.702,COULDN'T MAKE IT.
00:11:43.744,00:11:46.623,"OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT KIDS IN CHICAGO, THEY GO TO SCHOOL IN THE SUMMER."
00:11:46.665,00:11:49.459,THERE ISN'T. THEY JUST DO -- THEY GOT -- I'M ALONE.
00:11:49.501,00:11:50.960,WHAT'S THE STORY?
00:11:51.002,00:11:52.253,THERE IS NO STORY.
00:11:52.295,00:11:53.963,OH.
00:12:16.861,00:12:21.157,"DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF, MR. WILLIAMS?"
00:12:21.199,00:12:25.328,ANYTHING THAT WOULD ENLIGHTEN US CONCERNING YOUR SITUATION?
00:12:26.371,00:12:27.914,WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?
00:12:27.955,00:12:29.624,"YOU KNOW, NOBODY'S HIRING."
00:12:29.666,00:12:32.919,YOU CAN'T GET SPINACH OUT OF A TURNIP.
00:12:32.960,00:12:35.380,I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT.
00:12:35.422,00:12:36.715,"YOU CAN'T, HUH?"
00:12:36.755,00:12:39.593,THAT YOUR NEW TRUCK OUT FRONT?
00:12:41.261,00:12:43.804,WHICH ONE?
00:12:43.846,00:12:45.139,YEAH.
00:12:45.181,00:12:46.600,'Yeah' is not an affirmation...
00:12:46.641,00:12:50.019,YEAH IS NOT AN AFFIRMATION A MAN USES IN COURT.
00:12:50.061,00:12:51.563,"YES, SIR."
00:12:51.605,00:12:53.106,"JUDGE, YOUR HONOR."
00:12:53.147,00:12:56.526,GO ON. PITCH THEM.

00:13:12.875,00:13:18.715,"GUS, UH, WOULD YOU GIVE THOSE TO MR. WILLIAMS' EX-WIFE, PLEASE?"
00:13:18.757,00:13:23.010,THEN ESCORT MR. WILLIAMS TO HIS EX-TRUCK.
00:13:23.052,00:13:24.971,YOU'RE GONNA SIGN THAT VEHICLE OVER TO HER.
00:13:25.012,00:13:38.067,"AND YOU, MA'AM, ARE GONNA GO DOWN TO DEVANEY MOTORS, ASK FOR MIKE DEVANEY -- THE FATHER, NOT THE NITWIT SON -- AND SELL YOUR NEW TRUCK BACK TO HIM FOR WHATEVER THE TURNIP THERE PUT DOWN ON IT."
00:13:38.109,00:13:39.152,THIS AIN'T FAIR.
00:13:38.109,00:13:41.446,HOW -- HEY! ONE MORE WORD.
00:13:42.447,00:13:44.031,LOOK AROUND YOU.

00:22:28.346,00:22:30.224,"NO, HE ISSUED K-9 COMMANDS TO GET OUR ATTENTION."
00:22:30.266,00:22:31.725,HE HURLED PERIODICALS FOR SPORT.
00:22:31.767,00:22:35.813,"Glen: PLEASE, WITH ALL THE TROUBLE YOU MADE, YOU'RE LUCKY THAT'S ALL YOU GOT."

00:29:17.673,00:29:19.425,They think that he -- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
00:29:19.466,00:29:21.968,"UNLESS HE KILLED SOMEBODY, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN."
00:29:22.010,00:29:24.555,"They found a body, Hank."
00:29:27.266,00:29:32.812,"Judge: YOU MEAN, JUDGE, I CAN MILK HER, KILL HER, COOK HER, EAT HER EVEN, BUT THAT'S ILLEGAL?"
00:29:34.356,00:29:35.441,TRUE STORY!
00:29:35.482,00:29:37.859,Hanson: MR. PALMER.
00:29:37.901,00:29:40.153,"JUDGE PALMER, DEPUTY HANSON."
00:29:40.195,00:29:43.198,"SIR, DID ANYBODY OTHER THAN YOU HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR VEHICLE?"
00:29:43.240,00:29:44.408,"NO, SIR. NO, SIR."
00:29:44.450,00:29:45.743,YOU GOT TO BE SHITTING ME.
00:29:45.784,00:29:47.578,IS THIS AN INTERVIEW?
00:29:47.620,00:29:53.792,WE'VE GOT A WITNESS THAT PUTS HIS CAR ON ROUTE 30 HEADING TOWARDS SHELBY ROAD AT THE APPROXIMATE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.
00:29:53.833,00:29:56.754,"OH, BOY! BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO PUT HIS CAR AT THE SCENE."
00:29:56.795,00:29:59.590,ANY STRIP-MALL LAWYER IS GONNA CHEW THAT UP AND SPIT IT OUT.
00:29:59.632,00:30:00.716,STOLEN VEHICLE.
00:30:00.758,00:30:02.509,YOU NEED HIM BEHIND THE WHEEL.
00:30:02.551,00:30:04.428,"HANK, LET'S GO, PAL."
00:30:04.470,00:30:06.680,"WHOA, BOTH WAYS BOBBY, GRADUATION NIGHT."
00:30:06.722,00:30:09.308,"THE QUARRY, YOUR RANCHERO."
00:30:09.349,00:30:13.103,"YOU AND KEVIN THOMPSON IN THE BACKSEAT, NAKED, HUFFING WHIPPETS."
00:30:13.145,00:30:15.522,SHALL I CONTINUE?
00:30:15.564,00:30:17.023,IT'S JUST A RUMOR.
00:30:17.065,00:30:18.275,WHERE WERE WE?
00:30:20.235,00:30:22.780,HE'S BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BENCH TOO LONG.
00:30:22.821,00:30:24.990,"HE FORGETS, IF YOU DON'T TALK, YOU WALK."
00:30:25.031,00:30:26.450,WE DON'T HIDE BEHIND THE LAW HERE.
00:30:26.492,00:30:28.160,THERE'S DAMAGE TO THE FRONT OF MY CAR.
00:30:28.201,00:30:30.912,"I WENT TO THE CONVENIENCE STORE LAST NIGHT, ALL RIGHT?"
00:30:30.954,00:30:33.707,EVERY WORD LIMITS HIS OPTIONS.
00:30:33.749,00:30:36.293,"IMAGINE A FARAWAY PLACE, HANK..."
00:30:36.335,00:30:38.378,WHERE PEOPLE VALUE YOUR OPINION.
00:30:38.420,00:30:39.421,NOW GO THERE.
00:30:39.463,00:30:41.465,WHAT ABOUT BOOZE?
00:30:41.507,00:30:44.050,80% OF HIT-AND-RUNS INVOLVE LIQUOR.
00:30:44.092,00:30:46.428,HIS WIFE JUST DIED.
00:30:46.470,00:30:49.807,BUT YOU NEED AN ADMISSION FROM HIM.
00:30:49.848,00:30:52.934,"BETTER YET, A VOLUNTARY URINE SAMPLE."
00:30:52.976,00:30:55.562,THERE YOU GO. FILL 'ER UP.
00:30:55.604,00:31:00.859,A BLADDER FULL OF COURTESY COFFEE AND A SINCE YOU'RE IN THE JOHN ANYWAY SORT OF THING?
00:31:00.900,00:31:02.611,JUST MIGHT CATCH HIM OFF GUARD.
00:31:02.653,00:31:05.113,WE CAN GET EVERYTHING WE NEED FROM A HAIR SAMPLE.
00:31:08.200,00:31:10.076,SURE CAN.
00:31:10.118,00:31:11.787,YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOURSELF.
00:31:11.829,00:31:14.164,YOU'LL BE HALFWAY TO MANSLAUGHTER BY LUNCH.
00:31:14.206,00:31:18.460,"JUDGE PALMER, WE'RE, UH -- WE'RE GONNA NEED TO IMPOUND YOUR VEHICLE."
00:31:21.839,00:31:23.173,Hank: TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
00:31:23.215,00:31:24.299,Judge: I DON'T REMEMBER.
00:31:24.341,00:31:25.342,BECAUSE YOU WERE DRUNK?
00:31:25.384,00:31:27.052,"NO, BECAUSE I CAN'T REMEMBER."
00:31:27.093,00:31:29.012,DON'T YOU THINK I WANT TO REMEMBER?! I CAN'T!
00:31:29.054,00:31:31.849,"FOR ALL I KNOW, I NEVER HIT ANYTHING OR ANYBODY!"
00:31:31.890,00:31:33.475,"SO, I WAS IN THE LIQUOR CABINET."
00:31:33.517,00:31:37.103,WHAT KIND OF RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC KEEPS A STOCKED LIQUOR CABINET?
00:31:37.145,00:31:38.397,RECOVERED.
00:31:38.438,00:31:39.981,IT'S A REMINDER THAT I'M STRONGER.
00:31:40.023,00:31:41.608,IT HOLDS NO POWER OVER ME.
00:31:41.650,00:31:45.028,"RIGHT NOW, THAT COP HANSON'S ON HIS WAY TO THE MINI MART..."
00:31:45.070,00:31:46.446,OH.
00:31:46.488,00:31:54.037,...TO ASK SOME SCARED-SHITLESS HIGH SCHOOL CLERK WITH HALF A JOINT IN HIS FRONT POCKET IF YOU HAD THE ODOR OF AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE ON YOUR BREATH.
00:31:54.079,00:31:55.997,BLOODSHOT EYES?
00:31:56.039,00:31:57.750,SLURRED SPEECH?
00:32:08.635,00:32:11.930,THEY SHOULDN'T DRIVE TOGETHER.
00:32:11.971,00:32:14.974,"I'M ON YOUR SIDE, JUDGE."
00:32:15.016,00:32:20.814,"AND IF THIS GOES SOUTH, AND IT MIGHT, YOU NEED TO SAY WITH SOME SEMBLANCE OF A STRAIGHT FACE THAT YOU HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK IN 28 YEARS."
00:32:20.856,00:32:22.357,WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.
00:32:22.399,00:32:24.401,"IF YOU HIT SOMEBODY, THEY SWERVED IN FRONT OF YOU."
00:32:24.443,00:32:27.446,I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU DRY OUT AND PRACTICE THAT NARRATIVE.
00:32:27.487,00:32:29.656,NARRATE THIS!
00:32:36.288,00:32:38.624,Hank: WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO FILE ANOTHER CONTINUANCE.
00:32:38.665,00:32:40.083,WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?
00:32:40.125,00:32:42.043,"TRUST ME, I'M GONNA BE BACK FAST AS I CAN."
00:32:42.085,00:32:43.587,IT'S A PERSONAL MATTER.
00:32:43.629,00:32:45.798,"YEAH, I'D LOVE TO WALK OUT ON IT, BUT I CAN'T."
00:32:47.841,00:32:49.802,"KAREN, HOLD ON."
00:32:52.011,00:32:54.932,"WHY THE HELL ARE YOU CALLING ME, LISA?"
00:32:54.973,00:32:57.183,LAUREN?
00:32:57.225,00:33:00.103,"HI, HONEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MOMMY'S PHONE?"
00:33:00.145,00:33:02.648,"NO, NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT."
00:33:02.689,00:33:04.357,WHAT'S UP?
00:33:04.399,00:33:06.526,"I MISS YOU, TOO."
00:33:06.568,00:33:09.070,"EITHER I'LL COME HOME, OR MAYBE YOU'LL COME HERE."
00:33:09.112,00:33:12.115,"LOOK, LOOK, WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT, DON'T WORRY."
00:33:12.157,00:33:13.617,I PROMISE.
00:33:13.659,00:33:15.452,I'LL TAKE YOU SHOPPING.
00:33:15.494,00:33:17.245,WANT A CELLPHONE?
00:33:17.287,00:33:19.205,I'LL GET YOU...
00:33:19.247,00:33:20.916,DADDY HAS TO WORK.
00:33:20.958,00:33:22.793,YEAH.
00:33:22.835,00:33:25.796,FORENSICS FOUND TRACES OF BLOOD ON YOUR DAD'S CAR.
00:33:25.838,00:33:27.589,SO?
00:33:27.631,00:33:28.799,GREAT.
00:33:28.841,00:33:31.677,IT MATCHES THE VICTIM.
00:33:31.718,00:33:32.970,I'M SORRY.
00:33:33.011,00:33:34.137,IT'S MURDER TWO.
00:33:34.179,00:33:35.848,MURDER?
00:33:35.889,00:33:37.432,"SO, ARE YOU A CLAIRVOYANT?"
00:33:37.474,00:33:40.519,"THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE OF IT, SON -- HE'S JUST FUCKING OUT OF HIS MIND."
00:33:40.560,00:33:42.103,THAT'S A ROOKIE MOVE.
00:33:42.145,00:33:44.940,VICTIM IS MARK BLACKWELL.
00:33:44.982,00:33:48.067,"PRETTY AMAZING COINCIDENCE, DON'T YOU THINK?"
00:33:48.109,00:33:50.779,BLACKWELL?
00:34:32.487,00:34:34.573,YOU KILLED HIM!
00:34:34.614,00:34:36.241,"Glen: OH, SHIT, THAT'S MRS. BLACKWELL."
00:34:36.282,00:34:37.743,YOU KILLED MY SON!
00:34:37.784,00:34:39.786,"ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT."
00:34:39.828,00:34:41.120,STRAIGHT IN.
00:34:41.162,00:34:46.835,"WHEN MY LAWYERS ARE DONE WITH YOU, I'LL BE LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE!"
00:34:46.877,00:34:48.587,"WE'RE SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS, MA'AM."
00:34:48.628,00:34:50.047,SORRY?
00:34:50.088,00:34:51.256,YOU WILL BE!
00:34:51.297,00:34:52.799,"HANK, COME ON!"
00:34:52.841,00:34:55.844,AND YOU CAN SHOVE ALL THAT MA'AM SHIT.
00:34:55.886,00:34:57.470,Man: MOM.
00:34:57.512,00:34:58.889,I RECOGNIZE YOU.
00:34:58.931,00:35:00.724,YOU'RE NO ALTAR BOY.
00:35:06.479,00:35:08.523,IT'S ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.
00:35:21.453,00:35:23.622,WHY WERE THOSE PEOPLE SO MAD?
00:35:28.543,00:35:30.503,SHE SPIT ON THE WINDOW.
00:35:30.545,00:35:32.464,"LOOK, DAD'S A JUDGE, YOU KNOW?"
00:35:32.505,00:35:35.675,"SOMETIMES, I MEAN, HE HAS TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS."
00:35:35.717,00:35:37.176,THERE WAS A GIRL.
00:35:37.218,00:35:39.429,W-WHAT WAS HER NAME?
00:35:39.471,00:35:42.390,HOPE STEVENS.
00:35:42.432,00:35:46.185,"THERE WAS A GUY, MARK BLACKWELL."
00:35:46.227,00:35:50.107,"HOPE WAS HIS GIRLFRIEND, JUST TURNED 16."
00:35:50.189,00:35:52.692,"HE TOOK A .38 TO HER HOUSE, SHOT THE PLACE UP."
00:35:52.734,00:35:54.111,CAN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?
00:35:54.152,00:35:55.988,I DON'T GET IT.
00:35:54.152,00:36:03.787,"W-WHY -- HE SHOT OUT HER BEDROOM WINDOWS, ANGRY OVER WHATEVER KIDS GET ANGRY ABOUT WHEN THEY'VE BEEN, UH, DATING FOR WHAT -- SIX MONTHS?"
00:36:03.829,00:36:05.330,"NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME."
00:36:05.371,00:36:07.916,HE STOOD IN COURT AND WEPT LIKE A LOST CHILD.
00:36:07.958,00:36:10.585,"SAID HE WAS DRUNK, WOULD NEVER DO IT AGAIN."
00:36:10.627,00:36:13.171,"IF HE'D MEANT TO HURT HER, HE WOULD HAVE."
00:36:13.212,00:36:14.631,I BELIEVED HIM!
00:36:14.673,00:36:16.091,I BELIEVED HIM.
00:36:16.133,00:36:17.634,I BELIEVED HIM.
00:36:20.720,00:36:22.973,I GAVE HIM THE MINIMUM -- 30 DAYS.
00:36:23.015,00:36:25.266,I REMEMBER THE MORNING HE GOT OUT.
00:36:25.308,00:36:31.148,"GLEN AND I WERE IN THE BACKYARD, WITH HIS BREAKING BALL."
00:36:31.189,00:36:35.986,"PITCHING SCOUTS HAD STARTED TO COME TO HIS GAMES, FROM CINCINNATI, ST. LOUIS."
00:36:36.028,00:36:38.655,"BUT, UH..."
00:36:38.697,00:36:42.283,"GOD HELP US, WHILE WE DID THAT..."
00:36:42.325,00:36:44.161,BLACKWELL...
00:36:44.202,00:36:45.996,DRUG HER DOWN TO A SPILL POND.
00:36:46.038,00:36:49.582,Glen: IT WAS ABOUT 50 YARDS BEHIND HER HOUSE.
00:36:49.624,00:36:54.379,AND HE HAULED HER INTO 2 FEET OF WATER AND KNEELED ON HER CHEST UNTIL HE DROWNED HER.
00:36:56.214,00:37:00.259,DAD GAVE HIM 20 YEARS.
00:37:01.344,00:37:03.972,STOP THE CAR.
00:37:04.014,00:37:06.265,"SHIT-FOR-BRAINS, AM I SPEAKING KOREAN?"
00:37:06.307,00:37:07.517,STOP THE GODDAMN CAR!
00:37:14.649,00:37:16.317,I NEED MY WALK.
00:37:16.359,00:37:18.778,"LEAVING THE SCENE, BLOOD EVIDENCE, MOTIVE."
00:37:18.820,00:37:21.698,"BIGGEST MISTAKE OF YOUR CAREER, AND YOU JUST HAPPEN TO RUN HIM OVER?"
00:37:21.740,00:37:22.949,I COULD CONVICT YOU OVER COFFEE.
00:37:22.991,00:37:24.325,"BUT, NO, NO, ROUTINES ARE IMPORTANT."
00:37:24.367,00:37:26.078,CLOSE THE DOOR.
00:37:26.119,00:37:30.957,"IF THE BLOOD MATCHES, AND I HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT IT DOES, THEN I MUST HAVE CLIPPED HIM."
00:37:30.999,00:37:32.876,I DON'T REMEMBER ANY OF THAT.
00:37:32.918,00:37:36.129,THE I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED DEFENSE DOESN'T FLY WITH A CORPSE.
00:37:36.171,00:37:38.464,WE NEED TO ESTABLISH A FIRM DEFENSE.
00:37:38.506,00:37:42.844,WE GOT TO GET THE CHARGES DROPPED AND MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY AT THE PRELIMINARY HEARING.
00:37:42.886,00:37:44.012,WE NEVER GO TO TRIAL.
00:37:44.054,00:37:45.972,"THERE'S NO WE HERE, HENRY."
00:37:46.014,00:37:47.599,"THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT, PERIOD."
00:37:47.640,00:37:49.684,ANY DECENT LAWYER CAN ARGUE THIS EASILY.
00:37:49.726,00:37:53.354,"AND BY DECENT, I MEAN HONEST."
00:37:53.396,00:37:57.650,SOMEONE WITH INTEGRITY THAT AN INDIANA JUDGE WILL RESPECT.
00:37:57.692,00:37:59.819,I RETAINED ONE OF THAT BREED THIS MORNING.
00:37:59.861,00:38:00.946,ALL RIGHT?
00:38:00.987,00:38:03.823,I WISH I LIKED YOU MORE.
00:38:05.324,00:38:07.869,"Glen: AH, BOY."
00:38:07.911,00:38:09.871,HE DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
00:38:09.913,00:38:11.289,I WISH HE'D DIED INSTEAD OF MOM.
00:38:11.330,00:38:12.582,CUT IT OUT!
00:38:12.624,00:38:14.542,JUST CUT IT OUT!
00:38:14.584,00:38:15.794,THAT'S AWFUL.
00:38:14.584,00:38:17.670,"HE SAYS JUMP, YOU SAY, HOW HIGH?"
00:38:17.712,00:38:19.798,"HANK, YOU SHOOT YOUR MOUTH OFF TOO DAMN MUCH!"
00:38:19.839,00:38:22.759,Hank: DRIVING MISS DAISY.
00:38:22.801,00:38:24.010,MAYBE WE SHOULD FOLLOW DAD.
00:38:24.052,00:38:25.762,SHOULD I?
00:38:25.804,00:38:27.847,WHERE WERE YOU TWO WHEN THEY WERE DISTRIBUTING TESTICLES?
00:38:27.889,00:38:29.599,"FUCK IT, I'M OUT."
00:38:29.641,00:38:31.684,GOOD. GOOD!
00:38:37.816,00:38:40.485,"HEY, JUDGE, WHERE YOU GOING?"
00:38:40.526,00:38:42.403,INDIANA STATE PENITENTIARY'S THIS WAY.
00:38:42.445,00:38:44.823,KISS MY ASS.
00:38:55.000,00:38:59.087,WHAT LINE WERE WE IN WHEN THEY WERE DISTRIBUTING TESTICLES?
00:39:26.447,00:39:28.867,"YOU KNOW I HAVE TO GO, RIGHT?"
00:40:47.570,00:41:11.261,"JAGGED VACANCE, THICK WITH ICE I COULD SEE FOR MILES, MILES, MILES YOU'RE HERE TO LISTEN, NOT TALK, OKAY?"
00:41:13.679,00:41:17.516,"YOU KNOW, THE GREAT THING ABOUT AUTHENTIC MERCURY GLASS IS THE DOUBLE-WALL."
00:41:17.558,00:41:19.060,YOU SEE THAT IN THERE?
00:41:19.102,00:41:21.396,AND RIGHT ON THE BOTTOM -- NEW ENGLAND GLASS COMPANY.
00:41:21.438,00:41:22.897,"I MEAN, WHAT A GREAT FIND."
00:41:22.939,00:41:24.774,"UH, WOW."
00:41:24.816,00:41:28.069,"GUYS, YOU WANT TO HEAD UPSTAIRS TO MY OFFICE?"
00:41:28.111,00:41:31.530,JUDGE WARREN CAUGHT IT.
00:41:31.572,00:41:35.785,"YES, I DO."
00:41:31.572,00:41:37.745,"HE'S TOUGH, HE'S FAIR, AND FULL OF HIMSELF."
00:41:37.787,00:41:42.500,"THEY ASSIGNED A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, DWIGHT DICKHAM, OUT OF GARY?"
00:41:42.541,00:41:44.294,I WONDER WHY SO FAR.
00:41:44.336,00:41:47.172,THE PRELIMINARY HEARING'S SET FOR NEXT FRIDAY.
00:41:47.213,00:41:49.257,WOW! UH...
00:41:49.299,00:41:51.384,WE'RE IN A BIT OF A PICKLE.
00:41:51.426,00:41:52.760,"IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD, C.P."

00:42:03.771,00:42:06.607,"YES, YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT, OR, YES, YOU ATTENDED ONE?"
00:42:08.067,00:42:10.445,YOU CAN'T PRACTICE LAW WITHOUT GOING TO LAW SCHOOL.
00:42:10.487,00:42:11.529,"YEAH, VALPO."
00:42:12.613,00:42:14.657,VALPO?
00:42:14.699,00:42:16.534,"IT'S, UH -- UH, MOM!"

00:42:19.537,00:42:20.788,COME ON!
00:42:20.830,00:42:22.957,I HATE WHEN SHE STACKS BOOKS HERE.
00:42:22.999,00:42:24.917,"UM, IT'S, UH, HERE IN INDIANA."
00:42:24.959,00:42:26.544,WHERE -- DID YOU GO OUT OF STATE?
00:42:26.585,00:42:28.087,NORTHWESTERN.
00:42:28.129,00:42:30.673,"WOW, THAT'S A DANDY OF A SCHOOL."
00:42:30.715,00:42:32.467,EVER DEFENDED IN A JURY TRIAL?
00:42:32.509,00:42:33.592,"YES, I HAVE."
00:42:33.634,00:42:34.593,CHARGE?
00:42:34.635,00:42:36.429,ASSAULT.
00:42:36.471,00:42:38.223,THIRD.
00:42:38.264,00:42:39.640,IT WAS A GUILTY VERDICT.
00:42:39.682,00:42:45.188,COACH BLAKELY BROKE A CLIPBOARD OVER HIS QUARTERBACK'S HEAD DURING HALFTIME AT THE HOMECOMING GAME.
00:42:45.230,00:42:47.524,"NOW, IN HIS DEFENSE -- NOW HE GETS ONE."
00:42:47.565,00:42:49.150,...JOHN JR.
00:42:49.192,00:42:50.651,"HE JUST KEEPS SELLING, DOESN'T HE?"
00:42:50.693,00:42:53.405,SIT DOWN.
00:42:50.693,00:42:57.700,"UH, JUST SO YOU KNOW, SUMMERS I INTERNED AT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IN EVANSVILLE."
00:42:57.742,00:43:04.832,"AND AFTER GRADUATION, I CLERKED TWO YEARS FOR JUSTICE ROBERTS ON THE INDIANA SUPREME COURT, WHICH WAS A PRETTY COOL EXPERIENCE."
00:43:04.874,00:43:07.585,THE WORD WOW IS NOT YOUR FRIEND IN COURT.
00:43:07.626,00:43:09.254,THANK YOU.

00:43:24.643,00:43:26.229,YOU'RE MY GUY.
00:43:26.271,00:43:29.274,"YOUR HONOR, I'M GONNA FIGHT LIKE A BADGER FOR YOU."
00:43:29.315,00:43:30.691,YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT.
00:43:45.039,00:43:47.250,MORNING.

00:44:12.484,00:44:18.364,"YOUR HONOR, THE DEADLINE FOR FILING A CHANGE-OF-VENUE MOTION..."
00:44:18.406,00:44:19.949,HAS ALREADY COME AND GONE.
00:44:19.991,00:44:29.501,"SO, UNLESS THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WARRANTS FILING THE MOTION OUT OF TIME SAY IF THE COUNTY UP AND MOVED OVERNIGHT..."
00:44:30.460,00:44:31.961,...BARRING THAT...
00:44:32.003,00:44:34.755,THIS TRIAL HAPPENS RIGHT HERE IN CARLINVILLE.
00:44:34.797,00:44:37.425,"THIS IS A PRELIMINARY HEARING, NOT A TRIAL."
00:44:37.467,00:44:38.968,"WHAT'S THE STORY, MR. DICKHAM?"
00:44:39.010,00:44:41.179,FILING FOR A CHANGE OF VENUE?
00:44:43.806,00:44:49.020,"OUT OF CURIOSITY, YOUR HONOR, IF I WERE TO ASK FOR A CHANGE OF VENUE, YOU'D SAY WHAT?"
00:44:49.061,00:44:51.981,"YOU MISSED THE DEADLINE, BUT I'LL CONSIDER IT."
00:44:52.023,00:44:53.232,AND THEN?
00:44:53.274,00:44:55.109,DENY IT.
00:44:55.151,00:44:57.403,"NO MOTION, YOUR HONOR."
00:44:59.113,00:45:04.243,WE'RE HERE TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE TO BIND THIS OVER FOR TRIAL.
00:45:04.285,00:45:11.250,"I WANT TO HOLD THE PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE UNTIL I'VE TAKEN TESTIMONY, AFTER WHICH I'LL HEAR ARGUMENTS."
00:45:11.292,00:45:15.129,"WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY, LET'S GET STARTED, GENTLEMEN."
00:45:15.171,00:45:18.257,"C.P.: SHERIFF, AFTER YOU ARRIVED, WHAT -- WHAT HAPPENED?"
00:45:18.299,00:45:21.344,"WHEN I APPROACHED THE VICTIM, HE WAS UNRESPONSIVE."
00:45:21.386,00:45:25.515,"AND AT THAT TIME, DID YOU OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE?"
00:45:25.557,00:45:27.517,"HE WAS DEAD, SON."
00:45:27.559,00:45:28.809,"SO, NO."
00:45:28.851,00:45:31.187,THAT'S A NO.
00:45:31.229,00:45:34.065,Dickham: AND EXACTLY WHAT DID MR. PALMER TELL YOU?
00:45:34.106,00:45:38.570,MR. PALMER STATED HE DROVE HIS VEHICLE -- HIS 1971 CADILLAC DEVILLE?
00:45:38.611,00:45:40.613,CORRECT.
00:45:40.655,00:45:42.615,OKAY.
00:45:44.242,00:45:45.742,WE GET THIS WHOLE CASE DISMISSED.
00:45:45.784,00:45:47.453,IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
00:45:45.784,00:45:49.830,AND DID YOU SEE -- EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME!
00:45:49.872,00:45:51.207,YEAH?
00:45:51.249,00:45:52.833,"SIR, ARE YOU CO-COUNSEL?"
00:45:52.875,00:45:54.877,HE IS NOT.
00:45:54.919,00:45:56.879,SIT AND ZIP IT!
00:45:59.798,00:46:03.844,"Dickham: SIR, DID YOU FORM AN OPINION AS TO THE CAUSE OF DEATH?"
00:46:03.886,00:46:07.932,MASSIVE INTERNAL DAMAGE -- INJURIES CONSISTENT WITH BEING STRUCK BY A CAR.
00:46:07.973,00:46:09.141,"THANK YOU, DR. PUTNEY."
00:46:09.183,00:46:10.893,"NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, YOUR HONOR."
00:46:10.935,00:46:13.020,"CROSS-EXAMINATION, MR. KENNEDY?"
00:46:13.062,00:46:17.024,"UH, NO FURTHER QUE-- NO, NO QUESTIONS, YOUR HONOR."
00:46:17.066,00:46:21.946,"Dickham: SO YOU WERE WORKING THAT NIGHT AT THE MINI MART, AND YOU SAW JUDGE PALMER AND MR. BLACKWELL."
00:46:21.987,00:46:23.698,THEY WAS BOTH OVER BY THE COOLER.
00:46:23.740,00:46:25.575,DID YOU SEE THEM MAKE EYE CONTACT?
00:46:25.617,00:46:30.955,"YEAH, I SAW MR. BLACKWELL AND JUDGE PALMER MAKE EYE CONTACT."
00:46:30.996,00:46:32.915,AND THEN WHAT DID JUDGE PALMER DO?
00:46:32.957,00:46:34.292,DROPPED HIS EGGS.
00:46:36.544,00:46:39.547,THAT'S IT. OUT!
00:46:39.589,00:46:41.716,YOU READ THAT.
00:46:46.887,00:46:48.931,NOT MY FIRST TIME.
00:46:56.981,00:47:00.859,"Dickham: SO, AFTER THAT, DID THEY GO OUT TOGETHER?"
00:47:00.901,00:47:03.279,DID YOU SEE HIM FOLLOW HIM?
00:47:03.321,00:47:06.991,Gus: ALL RISE.
00:47:07.032,00:47:10.369,THE HONORABLE JUDGE SANFORD WARREN PRESIDING.
00:47:11.412,00:47:13.748,Judge Warren: BE SEATED.
00:47:13.790,00:47:23.758,"BASED ON THE TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESSES AND THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY MR. DICKHAM, THE COURT FINDS PROBABLE CAUSE TO HOLD THIS OVER FOR TRIAL."
00:47:23.800,00:47:28.387,JURY SELECTION WILL BEGIN ONE WEEK FROM TODAY.
00:47:28.429,00:47:30.598,SEE YOU FOLKS IN COURT.
00:47:58.417,00:48:01.629,AGREEMENT FROM THE GIPPER'S COACH.
00:48:02.921,00:48:04.923,EXCUSE ME?
00:48:04.965,00:48:09.094,"AGREEMENT FROM THE GIPPER'S COACH, 10 LETTERS."
00:48:09.136,00:48:11.806,AYE OF KNUTE.
00:48:11.848,00:48:15.476,"KNUTE ROCKNE, THE GREAT NOTRE DAME COACH FROM SOUTH BEND, INDIANA."
00:48:15.518,00:48:18.646,"HE KNOWS THE ANSWER, YET HE ASKS."
00:48:18.688,00:48:21.148,COME IN. SIT DOWN.
00:48:21.190,00:48:23.442,LET'S HOLD SOME COURT.
00:48:25.444,00:48:26.821,SIT DOWN.
00:48:26.863,00:48:28.989,"NOW, PEACEFULLY..."
00:48:29.031,00:48:29.990,...EASILY...
00:48:30.032,00:48:32.201,EASILY...
00:48:33.828,00:48:39.083,WHY DO YOU THINK DICKHAM MISSED THE FILING DEADLINE FOR A CHANGE OF VENUE?
00:48:39.124,00:48:41.335,"OH, HE DIDN'T MISS THE DEADLINE."
00:48:41.377,00:48:44.921,"FOR EVERY TWO PEOPLE WHO STAND IN FRONT OF YOU, ONE WINS, ONE LOSES."
00:48:44.963,00:48:47.592,"ONE LOVES YOU, ONE HATES YOU."
00:48:47.633,00:48:50.302,PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT DICKHAM HAD NO INTENTION OF FILING.
00:48:50.344,00:48:51.596,HE WANTS THE TRIAL HERE.
00:48:53.347,00:48:56.100,C.P. STEPPED DOWN THIS MORNING.
00:48:57.727,00:48:59.144,WHY?
00:48:59.186,00:49:02.106,SAID HE'D ASSIST A MORE SEASONED ATTORNEY.
00:49:02.147,00:49:06.736,COULDN'T LIVE WITH HIMSELF IF HIS LACK OF EXPERIENCE COST THE CASE.
00:49:06.778,00:49:09.405,"CONFIDENTIALLY, WHAT WERE YOU DOING ON SHELBY ROAD?"
00:49:09.447,00:49:12.784,THERE'S NO ROUTE FROM THE MINI MART HOME WHERE THAT MAKES SENSE.
00:49:12.825,00:49:14.493,"WAIT, WAIT, WAIT."
00:49:14.535,00:49:17.705,ARE YOU ASKING IF YOU CAN REPRESENT ME?
00:49:20.833,00:49:22.084,OKAY.
00:49:22.126,00:49:24.712,I REMEMBER BEING AT THE MINI MART.
00:49:24.754,00:49:26.547,I NEEDED EGGS.
00:49:26.589,00:49:29.966,"THE ROAD HOME WAS WASHED OUT, WHERE IT DIPS NEAR THE OLD MILL."
00:49:30.008,00:49:32.969,"I TURNED AROUND, STOPPED AT THE LIGHT ON STATE."
00:49:33.011,00:49:35.180,"THEN, UH..."
00:49:36.849,00:49:39.811,...THEN I'M MISSING TIME.
00:49:48.110,00:49:51.447,CAN I BORROW YOUR PEN?
00:49:53.407,00:49:57.161,"TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, NO, I'M NOT ASKING IF I CAN REPRESENT YOU."
00:49:57.202,00:49:58.621,IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.
00:49:58.663,00:50:01.998,"YOU CAN'T AFFORD ME, SO I'D HAVE TO DO IT FOR FREE."
00:50:02.040,00:50:07.755,"FORTUNATELY, I'M A BIT LIGHT ON MY PRO BONO QUOTA THIS YEAR."

00:50:48.671,00:50:50.840,"NO, JUST WATCHING."
00:50:50.882,00:50:55.636,WHEN YOU SAID THAT THE OLD MAN WAS PLAYING CHESS EVERY WEDNESDAY WITH WHO WAS IT?
00:50:55.678,00:50:57.262,WITH DOC MORRIS.
00:50:57.304,00:50:59.306,'CAUSE HE DOESN'T PLAY CHESS.
00:51:01.099,00:51:04.937,"IN FACT, THE ONLY THING HE DETESTS MORE THAN BOARD GAMES IS DOCTORS."
00:51:04.979,00:51:07.481,HE DOES SO PLAY CHESS.
00:51:07.523,00:51:10.066,I'LL SHOW YOU.
00:51:10.108,00:51:13.821,"IT'S NOT REALLY READY YET, BUT..."

00:52:28.395,00:52:32.190,"LOOK, WE BOTH KNOW YOU DIDN'T INTENTIONALLY HIT HIM, BUT THAT'S THE WAY THEY'RE GONNA SPIN IT."
00:52:32.232,00:52:35.653,"NOW, A FEW SHOTS OF JACK MIXED WITH JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF AXE TO GRIND..."
00:52:35.694,00:52:37.989,THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
00:52:38.030,00:52:40.032,"BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DRINKING, HAVE YOU?"
00:52:40.074,00:52:41.450,NO.

00:53:05.307,00:53:07.852,"YOUR MOTHER KNEW, THAT'S ALL."
00:53:07.893,00:53:10.354,THEY NEED INTENT FOR MURDER -- THAT'S OUR CASE.
00:53:10.395,00:53:13.273,WE ROLL OUT A DIMINISHED ABILITY DEFENSE DUE TO THE CHEMO.
00:53:13.315,00:53:15.985,"IF WE CAN GAIN SYMPATHY FROM THE JURY, THEY'LL NEVER CONVICT YOU."

01:00:21.159,01:00:24.288,I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD PREP YOU BEFORE YOU MEET GRANDPA PALMER.
01:00:24.329,01:00:26.290,'CAUSE HE IS NOTHING LIKE GRANDPA SCHNEIDER.
01:00:26.331,01:00:29.585,"GRANDPA SCHNEIDER IS, KIND OF, YOU KNOW, NICE AND AFFABLE..."
01:00:29.626,01:00:32.588,"AND HE'D MAYBE TAKE YOU FOR ICE CREAM, MAYBE HE'LL READ TO YOU."
01:00:32.629,01:00:34.506,GRANDPA PALMER DOESN'T WANT TO DO ANY OF THAT.
01:00:34.548,01:00:37.217,"IF YOU ASK HIM TO READ TO YOU, HE MIGHT THROW THE BOOK AT YOU."
01:00:37.259,01:00:38.635,"BUT ANYWAY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT."
01:00:38.676,01:00:39.803,"I MEAN, HE'S NOT EVIL."
01:00:39.844,01:00:44.141,"HE'S JUST A DIRTY OLD MUMMY, AND HE CAN'T HURT YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE SPECIAL."
01:00:44.182,01:00:46.602,"OH, MY GOD, THERE HE IS."
01:00:46.643,01:00:52.524,"HE'S USUALLY WRAPPED IN GAUZE, AND OOZING AND SHUFFLING."
01:00:52.566,01:00:56.111,HE MUST HAVE COME OUTSIDE TO FEED.

01:02:06.097,01:02:07.891,I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU ALONE NOW.
01:02:11.811,01:02:13.897,WHOSE ROOM IS THIS?
01:02:13.938,01:02:17.275,IT WAS YOUR UNCLE GLEN'S.
01:02:17.317,01:02:20.445,WHY'S THERE SO MANY TROPHIES?
01:02:20.487,01:02:22.489,HE WAS A REALLY GOOD BASEBALL PLAYER.
01:02:22.531,01:02:24.616,REALLY GOOD.
01:02:24.658,01:02:27.703,DID HE PLAY ON TV?
01:02:27.744,01:02:30.330,HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN ON A BIG TEAM...
01:02:30.372,01:02:35.001,"BUT WHEN GLEN AND I WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL, WE GOT INTO A REALLY BAD CAR ACCIDENT."
01:02:35.043,01:02:37.337,THEN THIS HAND GOT MESSED UP.
01:02:39.256,01:02:42.467,"OH, I'M SORRY."
01:02:47.556,01:02:50.308,WHY DIDN'T HE TAKE HIS TROPHIES TO HIS OWN HOUSE?
01:02:50.350,01:02:54.062,THEY WERE MORE IMPORTANT TO HIS FATHER.
01:03:02.529,01:03:04.822,KIND OF A...TOUCHY SUBJECT.
01:03:04.864,01:03:06.783,GO TO SLEEP.
01:03:07.909,01:03:10.662,"NIGHT, BABY."
01:03:12.163,01:03:14.124,"OKAY, LET'S REHEARSE."
01:03:14.165,01:03:18.503,"MR. PALMER, MARK BLACKWELL APPEARED IN YOUR COURT PRIOR TO KILLING MISS STEVENS, CORRECT?"
01:03:18.545,01:03:20.130,UH-HUH.
01:03:20.171,01:03:27.220,"WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE APPEARED IN MY COURT, BUT -- BUT YOU'D AGREE THAT THERE WERE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THIS CASE."
01:03:27.262,01:03:30.974,MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT THEIR CASES ARE PRETTY SPECIAL.
01:03:31.015,01:03:33.268,"OKAY. BY THE WAY, THERE'S NO SNACKS ON THE WITNESS STAND."
01:03:33.310,01:03:35.853,GIVE IT BACK.
01:03:35.895,01:03:37.606,I DON'T NEED PREPARING.
01:03:37.648,01:03:39.608,YOU'VE NEVER SAT ON A WITNESS STAND.
01:03:39.650,01:03:42.569,YOU'VE NEVER BEEN IN THAT SEAT.
01:03:44.321,01:03:46.864,"DICKHAM DOESN'T HAVE INTENT, HENRY."
01:03:46.906,01:03:48.325,AND HE NEVER WILL.
01:03:48.366,01:03:49.909,DICKHAM IS A SNAKE CHARMER.
01:03:49.951,01:03:53.871,"HE'LL PLAY HIS TUNE, GET THE JURY SWINGING TO HIS VERSION OF THAT NIGHT..."
01:03:53.913,01:03:58.627,AND THEN YOU CAN SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR DREAMS OF FLAGS FLYING AT HALF-MAST WHEN YOU'RE DEAD.
01:03:58.669,01:04:02.005,IT'S HALF-STAFF.
01:04:04.716,01:04:06.384,YEAH?
01:04:06.426,01:04:07.511,FUCK IT.
01:04:07.552,01:04:09.471,ALL RIGHT.
01:04:09.513,01:04:14.892,NO NEED TO BE SO MOROSE...HENRY.
01:04:19.648,01:04:21.107,SAM.

01:04:22.484,01:04:23.735,"WELL, MY HEAD'S IN THE OVEN."
01:04:23.777,01:04:29.115,"I WAS JUST THINKING, IT WAS EITHER THAT OR MAYBE I SHOWER UP AND COME MEET YOU."
01:04:29.157,01:04:31.409,GOD. OKAY. THERE?
01:04:31.451,01:04:33.704,ALL RIGHT.
01:04:33.745,01:04:35.372,"Hank: OH, MY GOD."
01:04:35.413,01:04:37.915,LOOKS TALLER THAN IT USED TO.
01:04:37.957,01:04:40.460,DID THEY RAISE IT?
01:04:40.502,01:04:44.047,"COME ON, BIG CITY, SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT."
01:04:51.095,01:04:53.807,"ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST GONNA STRETCH OUT FOR A SEC."
01:04:53.849,01:04:55.684,"COME ON, GIVE ME A BOOST."
01:05:01.481,01:05:07.362,"YOU SILLY -- GOD, IT WAS TOO EASY."

01:05:26.172,01:05:27.716,"SO, IT'S MIDNIGHT."
01:05:27.758,01:05:31.469,"I'M ON THE DAYTON BLACKTOP, HAULING ASS HOME."
01:05:31.511,01:05:33.179,"'76 CHEVETTE, FAKE WOOD PANELING."
01:05:33.221,01:05:34.681,CHEVETTE? NO.
01:05:34.723,01:05:36.140,"I KNOW, RIGHT?"
01:05:36.182,01:05:37.475,WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
01:05:37.517,01:05:40.019,"CORNER OF MY EYE, I SPOT SOMETHING."
01:05:40.061,01:05:42.522,BIGGEST BUCK YOU HAVE EVER SEEN.
01:05:42.564,01:05:47.611,"12, 14 POINTS, 200 POUNDS, GIVE OR TAKE, CHARGING THE ROAD, STRAIGHT FOR ME."
01:05:47.652,01:05:52.574,"WE SKID, ONE HAND ON THE WHEEL, ONE HAND ON CARLA."
01:05:52.616,01:05:54.492,THIS DEER JUMPS...
01:05:54.534,01:05:56.745,FLIES OVER THE HOOD...

01:05:59.956,01:06:03.167,"HE'S COMING THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, ALL ANTLERS AND HOOFS..."
01:06:03.209,01:06:04.920,KILLING ME FOR SURE AND MAYBE BOTH OF US.
01:06:04.961,01:06:08.172,I MADE A DECISION RIGHT THEN AND THERE.
01:06:08.214,01:06:12.093,WHATEVER HAD OR HADN'T HAPPENED IN THE PAST...
01:06:12.135,01:06:15.430,I WAS GONNA BE THE HERO OF MY OWN STORY.
01:06:20.268,01:06:21.478,SOUND CORNY?
01:06:21.519,01:06:23.521,SOUNDS EPIC.
01:06:23.563,01:06:27.734,"I HAD 4 GRAND TO MY NAME, I BORROWED ANOTHER 12 FROM GRANDPA."
01:06:27.776,01:06:29.527,TOOK THAT 16 GRAND.
01:06:29.569,01:06:31.696,I MADE DAN AN OFFER FOR THE DINER THAT HE COULDN'T REFUSE.
01:06:31.738,01:06:34.407,THIS PLACE WAS ON ITS LAST LEGS -- THIS PLACE -- THIS IS YOUR PLACE.

01:06:55.136,01:06:57.514,"WHAT, YOU DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW ENOUGH TO BE IMPRESSED?"
01:06:57.555,01:07:00.057,"I ALWAYS LIKED YOU, IT'S JUST -- YOU'RE A DICK."

01:08:03.329,01:08:04.873,WHAT'S WRONG?
01:08:04.915,01:08:07.000,YOU KNOW I'M LEAVING WHEN THE TRIAL IS OVER.
01:08:07.042,01:08:08.877,ARE YOU SURE YOU -- WE SHOULD DO THIS?

01:08:10.754,01:08:13.673,HE'S SURE.
01:08:17.802,01:08:21.222,WHY DID WE COME HERE?
01:08:21.264,01:08:26.019,"I LOVE SEEING YOU HERE, BUT I'M NOT NAIVE, HANK, I KNOW YOU."
01:08:26.061,01:08:28.229,WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW?
01:08:28.271,01:08:29.606,HONESTLY.
01:08:29.647,01:08:32.525,THAT I'M A DECENT GUY?
01:08:32.567,01:08:36.780,"THAT I'M A PHENOMENAL LAWYER, THAT I GOT A WORK ETHIC THAT'LL RIVAL THE FUCKING AMISH?"
01:08:36.821,01:08:37.822,WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
01:08:37.864,01:08:39.407,SAY IT.
01:08:39.449,01:08:42.243,I'M USED TO BEING HELD UNDER SCRUTINY.
01:08:42.285,01:08:43.703,HERE'S WHAT I KNOW.
01:08:43.745,01:08:46.081,I AM NEVER LEAVING CARLINVILLE.
01:08:46.122,01:08:47.582,I LOVE IT HERE.
01:08:47.624,01:08:54.672,AND YOU'RE JUST A BOY FROM INDIANA WHO'S GONNA DO WHATEVER HE HAS TO DO TO PRETEND THAT'S NOT TRUE.
01:09:00.637,01:09:02.639,LOCK THE DOOR BEHIND YOU.
01:09:02.680,01:09:04.682,I'M GONNA GO PLAY WITH MYSELF.
01:09:04.724,01:09:06.267,I'LL BE THINKING OF YOU.
01:09:08.269,01:09:11.355,And I made out with your daughter.
01:09:23.367,01:09:25.745,THE JUDGE SAYS HE'S MISSING TIME.
01:09:25.787,01:09:27.122,EXPLAIN THAT TO ME.
01:09:27.163,01:09:29.248,IT'S CALLED CHEMO BRAIN...
01:09:29.290,01:09:31.542,ALONG WITH THE FATIGUE AND THE CRACKED SKIN.
01:09:31.584,01:09:33.837,YOU CAN SOMETIMES SUFFER FROM MEMORY LOSS...
01:09:33.878,01:09:37.590,"CONFUSION, DEMENTIA, DELUSIONS."
01:09:37.632,01:09:40.093,"VERY REAL POSSIBILITY, A PROBABILITY..."
01:09:40.135,01:09:42.345,THAT HE WAS MENTALLY IMPAIRED THE NIGHT HE HIT BLACKWELL.
01:09:42.386,01:09:44.555,"IF YOU CAN CORROBORATE THAT, I NEED IT IN MY BACK POCKET."
01:09:44.597,01:09:46.307,I'M NOT ASKING.
01:09:46.349,01:09:48.810,HE'S GETTING CHEMOTHERAPY IN A FISHING CABIN.
01:09:48.852,01:09:51.146,I DON'T THINK HE WANTS ANYONE KNOWING.
01:09:51.187,01:09:53.815,"AND I'M HIS DOCTOR, I'M BOUND BY HIS WISHES."
01:09:53.857,01:09:57.193,YOU BOUND BY HIS WISHES OR HIS VANITY?
01:09:57.234,01:09:59.529,WHEN WILL HE BE DONE WITH THE TREATMENTS?
01:09:59.570,01:10:02.239,"WELL, LIKE I TOLD YOUR FATHER, THAT'S UP TO HIM."
01:10:02.281,01:10:04.575,TO HIM?
01:10:04.617,01:10:08.163,BUT...HOW WOULD HE KNOW?
01:10:08.204,01:10:10.247,SO WHAT EXACTLY DID HE TELL YOU?
01:10:10.289,01:10:12.667,HE TOLD ME IT'S UNDER CONTROL.
01:10:12.709,01:10:15.252,"GIVE IT UP, YOU COUNTRY QUACK."
01:10:15.294,01:10:17.714,I'M NOT HIS SON.
01:10:17.755,01:10:18.923,"WOW, THIS ISN'T AN ACT, IS IT?"
01:10:18.965,01:10:20.341,YOU REALLY AREN'T A PLEASANT PERSON.
01:10:20.383,01:10:22.343,RIGHT NOW?
01:10:22.385,01:10:28.307,"ONCE I SUBPOENA YOU, GET YOU ON THE STAND AND EXTRACT THE TRUTH FROM YOUR ASS LIKE TREE SAP..."
01:10:28.349,01:10:32.020,"THEN YOU'LL REALIZE IN THAT MOMENT, CORRECT, I'M NOT A PLEASANT PERSON."
01:10:36.941,01:10:39.443,WE CAUGHT IT TOO LATE TO CUT IT OUT.
01:10:39.485,01:10:43.031,TO SLAP A BAG ON IT.
01:10:43.073,01:10:45.742,IF HE'D HAD REGULAR SCREENINGS...
01:10:45.783,01:10:51.122,BUT THE JUDGE WASN'T THE TYPE TO INVITE A CAMERA WITH ANY DEGREE OF REGULARITY.
01:10:52.749,01:10:56.836,INSISTED THAT HE TRY.
01:10:58.588,01:11:01.549,I SUSPECT HE'S STILL DOING IT FOR HER.
01:11:01.591,01:11:05.386,I'VE BEEN TREATING HIM FOR A YEAR.
01:11:05.428,01:11:09.348,HIS CONDITION IS ADVANCED.
01:11:15.312,01:11:17.815,Judge: CAFÃ© DU MONDE.

01:18:30.373,01:18:40.841,"Dickham: SIR, I APPRECIATE THE PRIMER IN DNA EVIDENCE ANALYSIS, BUT BOTTOM-LINE THIS FOR US -- WHAT DO ALL THOSE NUMBERS AND PERCENTAGES MEAN WHEN DETERMINING IF IT'S MARK BLACKWELL'S BLOOD ON JUDGE PALMER'S CAR?"
01:18:40.883,01:18:42.718,IT'S THE VICTIM'S BLOOD ON THE CAR.
01:18:42.759,01:18:45.388,Hank: DIDN'T TAKE A SWING AT MR. BLACKWELL?
01:18:45.429,01:18:46.847,"NO, SIR."

01:19:02.196,01:19:03.280,PERCOCET.

01:19:06.867,01:19:08.827,YES.
01:19:06.867,01:19:10.871,"IN THAT CONDITION, COULD HE HAVE BEEN RIDING IN A STRAIGHT LINE?"
01:19:10.913,01:19:14.166,"IF HE COULD RIDE A BIKE AT ALL, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SWERVING."
01:19:14.208,01:19:20.339,"Dickham: MRS. BLACKWELL, AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS AND ALL THAT HEARTBREAK, HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN HE WAS RELEASED?"

01:19:23.259,01:19:26.387,I'D WAITED SO LONG FOR HIM TO COME HOME.

01:19:54.790,01:19:55.916,TWICE.
01:19:55.958,01:19:58.628,ONE FOR EACH HAND.
01:19:58.669,01:20:01.672,Hanson: IT'S A 20-DEGREE BEND AT BEST.
01:20:01.714,01:20:07.928,"SO, DEPUTY HANSON, LOOKING AT THIS ROAD, THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT JUDGE PALMER TRIED TO SLOW HIS VEHICLE."
01:20:07.970,01:20:10.681,NO.
01:20:07.970,01:20:13.643,"AS A MATTER OF FACT, THERE ARE NO BRAKE MARKS AT ALL, ARE THERE?"
01:20:13.684,01:20:15.018,"NO, SIR."
01:20:15.060,01:20:17.187,"NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, YOUR HONOR."
01:20:17.229,01:20:19.231,MR. PALMER.
01:20:19.273,01:20:22.610,"DEPUTY HANSON, YOU WERE PREVIOUSLY AN OFFICER IN DETROIT."
01:20:22.652,01:20:26.029,OBJECTION. THE DEPUTY'S CREDENTIALS ARE NOT IN QUESTION.
01:20:26.071,01:20:28.407,I WAS GONNA SAY WELCOME TO CARLINVILLE.
01:20:29.533,01:20:30.909,UH-HUH.
01:20:30.951,01:20:34.955,"AS STATED BY MR. DICKHAM, THESE PHOTOS WERE TAKEN THE MORNING OF THE INCIDENT."
01:20:34.997,01:20:37.458,"UH, WHAT IS THAT?"
01:20:38.875,01:20:40.377,RIGHT THERE.
01:20:40.419,01:20:42.505,"NOT REALLY, NO."
01:20:42.546,01:20:44.381,DOES THAT HELP?
01:20:45.758,01:20:47.802,ROADKILL.
01:20:47.843,01:20:49.720,IS THERE AN OFFER OF PROOF HERE?
01:20:49.762,01:20:50.929,"WHAT'S YOUR POINT, MR. PALMER?"
01:20:50.971,01:20:53.223,THAT THERE IS A SNAPPIN' TURTLE.
01:20:54.809,01:20:56.477,AND?
01:20:56.519,01:20:59.021,AND DETROIT CAN BE FORGIVEN...
01:20:59.062,01:21:02.274,FOR NOT KNOWING WHAT RUNNING OVER A SNAPPING TURTLE IS LIKE.
01:21:02.316,01:21:05.068,NOBODY HITS ONE IF THEY SEE IT AND CAN POSSIBLY AVOID IT.
01:21:05.110,01:21:09.156,"YOU HIT A RABBIT, POSSUM, SKUNK, YOUR CAR GOES BUMP, BUMP."
01:21:09.198,01:21:13.452,BUT NAILING A BIG SNAPPER IS SIMILAR TO SMACKING INTO A CINDERBLOCK.
01:21:13.494,01:21:14.578,CAR GOES KA-BAM!
01:21:14.620,01:21:16.163,KA-BOOM!
01:21:16.205,01:21:19.958,"MR. PALMER, WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?"
01:21:20.000,01:21:25.297,"WELL, YOUR HONOR, THE PROSECUTION MAINTAINS THAT A LACK OF BRAKE MARKS..."
01:21:25.339,01:21:29.051,IS EVIDENCE THAT MR. BLACKWELL WAS DELIBERATELY STRUCK.
01:21:29.092,01:21:38.477,"THAT IT'S NOT REASONABLE TO ASSUME JUDGE PALMER COULD HAVE HIT SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL, IN THE DARK, RAINING, NOT REALIZED IT WAS A PERSON THAT WAS HIT, JUST KEPT GOING."
01:21:38.519,01:21:40.312,THAT'S BEEN FIRMLY ESTABLISHED.
01:21:40.354,01:21:42.565,ARE WE WITHIN A MILE OF A QUESTION HERE?
01:21:42.606,01:21:48.696,"QUESTION IS, DEPUTY, ANY BRAKE MARKS IN FRONT OF THAT TURTLE?"
01:21:52.115,01:21:53.701,"YES, NO?"
01:21:53.743,01:21:56.912,"NO, THERE ARE NOT."
01:21:56.953,01:21:59.081,THANK YOU.
01:21:59.122,01:22:00.875,THAT'S ALL I HAVE.
01:22:11.218,01:22:14.054,Judge: YOU REARRANGE EVERYTHING!
01:22:14.096,01:22:15.639,"ALL RIGHT, MARY!"
01:22:15.681,01:22:18.475,"WAIT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?"
01:22:18.517,01:22:20.936,WHAT? GODDAMN!
01:22:20.977,01:22:24.481,"DON'T BE A YOU-KNOW-WHAT, MARY!"
01:22:38.454,01:22:40.456,MY MEMORY PLAYS TRICKS ON ME.
01:22:40.497,01:22:44.251,IT PLAYS TRICKS ON ME.
01:22:44.293,01:22:46.462,YOU LEFT TOO SOON.
01:22:46.503,01:22:48.756,H-HEY.
01:22:48.798,01:22:51.508,I THINK I HEARD YOU HAVING A BAD DREAM.
01:23:00.851,01:23:03.061,"GOD, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HANDS?"
01:23:04.563,01:23:07.441,HERE.
01:23:21.037,01:23:22.331,HEY.
01:23:22.372,01:23:23.791,"HEY, HEY."
01:23:23.833,01:23:25.501,WHO'S THE BEST LAWYER YOU'VE EVER SEEN?
01:23:25.542,01:23:27.002,COME ON.
01:23:27.043,01:23:28.963,MINE'S ROBERT GRAHAM.
01:23:29.004,01:23:30.464,I WORK FOR HIM.
01:23:30.506,01:23:34.217,"HE JUST, HE DOESN'T LOSE."
01:23:34.259,01:23:37.179,"NOW, YOU."
01:23:37.220,01:23:40.182,UH...
01:23:40.223,01:23:41.851,MR. SHAW.
01:23:41.892,01:23:44.520,MY FIRST JOB AFTER LAW SCHOOL.
01:23:44.561,01:23:47.690,"A DRIFTER KILLED A FARMER, VIOLATED HIS WIFE."
01:23:47.731,01:23:50.275,FIVE POINTS ROAD WITH A CORN KNIFE.
01:23:50.317,01:23:53.278,VILE HUMAN BEING.
01:23:53.320,01:23:56.615,COURT ASSIGNED MR. SHAW THE CASE.
01:23:56.657,01:24:01.954,"SO, WE TOOK DINNER TO THE JAIL, 'CAUSE EVERY NIGHT, MR. SHAW SAT WITH HIM."
01:24:01.996,01:24:05.666,"PREPARED HIM, DEFENDED HIM."
01:24:05.708,01:24:07.918,NO TRICKS.
01:24:07.960,01:24:09.879,HE WON?
01:24:09.920,01:24:11.463,CH-CH.
01:24:11.505,01:24:13.674,ELECTROCUTED.
01:24:15.091,01:24:19.555,"HE WAS DEAD, BUT MR. SHAW HAD TO LIVE HERE."
01:24:21.181,01:24:24.852,"HE WAS THREATENED, SPIT ON."
01:24:24.894,01:24:27.354,PEOPLE WOULDN'T SIT NEAR HIM IN CHURCH.
01:24:27.396,01:24:31.901,"HE COULD HAVE REFUSED THE CASE EASILY, BUT HE BELIEVED IN THE LAW."
01:24:31.942,01:24:35.696,I CAN'T SAY BEST.
01:24:35.738,01:24:37.698,BUT HENRY SHAW?
01:24:40.784,01:24:43.370,MOST DECENT MAN I EVER MET.
01:24:43.412,01:24:45.915,EVER. EVER.
01:24:45.956,01:24:48.250,YEAH.
01:24:48.291,01:24:49.585,HENRY?
01:24:49.626,01:24:51.628,DECENT MAN.
01:24:51.670,01:24:53.380,GREAT MAN.
01:24:53.422,01:24:57.634,HENRY SHAW.
01:24:59.678,01:25:00.721,HANK PALMER.
01:25:00.763,01:25:02.639,WHITE: Hank?
01:25:02.681,01:25:05.308,Wondering if you can come by the station.
01:25:05.350,01:25:07.603,There's something you should see.
01:25:14.735,01:25:18.072,Hank: WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE SECURITY FOOTAGE FROM THE NIGHT OF THE ACCIDENT.
01:25:18.113,01:25:22.200,"HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS: THE JUDGE LEAVES THE STORE, HIS CAR GOES ONE WAY..."
01:25:22.242,01:25:23.786,PATIENCE.
01:25:36.632,01:25:37.549,TIME?
01:25:37.591,01:25:39.509,FOUR MINUTES 45.
01:25:44.431,01:25:46.349,HE DIDN'T GET TO THE MILL.
01:25:46.391,01:25:48.226,AND?
01:25:48.268,01:25:52.188,"IN HIS STATEMENT, JUDGE PALMER SAID HE REACHED THE ROAD NEAR THE MILL."
01:25:52.230,01:25:53.816,"IT WAS WASHED OUT, AND HE TURNED AROUND."
01:25:53.857,01:25:55.275,HE'S LYING.
01:25:55.317,01:25:58.445,IT TAKES NINE MINUTES TO GET TO THE MILL AND BACK.
01:25:58.487,01:26:00.781,YOUR DAD DID IT IN FIVE.
01:26:00.823,01:26:04.534,HE DIDN'T TURN AROUND BECAUSE IT WAS WASHED OUT.
01:26:04.576,01:26:06.369,HE TURNED AROUND TO FOLLOW BLACKWELL.
01:26:06.411,01:26:07.955,HE'S LIVED HERE HIS WHOLE LIFE.
01:26:07.997,01:26:09.790,YOU THINK HE CAN'T GAUGE WHEN THE ROAD'S GONNA FLOOD?
01:26:09.832,01:26:11.125,THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
01:26:11.166,01:26:13.251,"SHERIFF, MAY WE USE YOUR OFFICE, PLEASE?"
01:26:14.920,01:26:16.212,THANKS.
01:26:16.254,01:26:18.132,"WELL, YOU KNOW HOW TO CLEAR A ROOM."
01:26:20.425,01:26:22.385,"TEN YEARS, HE'LL DO SEVEN."
01:26:22.427,01:26:24.304,OFFER EXPIRES WHEN YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR.
01:26:24.346,01:26:27.141,YOU WANT ME TO FLY YOU?
01:26:27.182,01:26:28.892,"I LIKE YOU TOO, BUT I'M SO BORED."
01:26:28.934,01:26:31.020,I HAVE INTENT NOW.
01:26:32.938,01:26:34.356,PREMEDITATION.
01:26:34.397,01:26:39.402,I'LL PAINT YOUR FATHER AS A HOLIER-THAN-THOU PRICK DETERMINED TO SEE WHAT HE CONSIDERS JUSTICE SERVED.
01:26:39.444,01:26:44.616,"MY FATHER IS A HOLIER-THAN-THOU PRICK DETERMINED TO SEE WHAT HE CONSIDERS JUSTICE SERVED, SO IT'S GONNA BE A LIGHT DAY."
01:26:44.658,01:26:47.619,THAT'S FUNNY.
01:26:47.661,01:26:50.413,I GUESS I CAN'T FAULT YOU FOR NOT REMEMBERING ME.
01:26:50.455,01:26:52.958,I WAS JUST SECOND CHAIR FOR THE PROSECUTION.
01:26:53.000,01:26:55.502,YOU DEFENDED THAT MILWAUKEE BEER BARON'S KID.
01:26:55.544,01:26:57.546,THE ONE WHO WENT SLUMMING IN GARY.
01:26:57.587,01:27:00.632,"40 MILLION IN THE BANK, ONE DEAD PROSTITUTE?"
01:27:00.674,01:27:02.134,"BY GOD, YOU'RE GOOD."
01:27:02.176,01:27:04.344,BEST VERDICT MONEY CAN BUY.
01:27:04.386,01:27:08.140,EVERYBODY WANTS ATTICUS FINCH TILL THERE'S A DEAD HOOKER IN A HOT TUB.
01:27:08.182,01:27:10.059,THERE'S YOUR BUMPER STICKER.
01:27:10.100,01:27:14.188,"SO, IN A NUTSHELL, YOU'RE FOLLOWING ME DOWN HERE TO SETTLE A SCORE?"
01:27:14.229,01:27:16.106,"GOOD LORD, NO."
01:27:16.148,01:27:22.029,"I FOLLOWED YOU DOWN HERE BECAUSE I KNEW IF I DIDN'T, IT WAS LIKELY SOMEBODY WAS GONNA GET AWAY WITH MURDER."
01:27:22.071,01:27:24.865,MY FATHER IS A LOT OF UNPLEASANT THINGS; A MURDERER IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
01:27:24.907,01:27:26.449,BUT HE IS A LIAR.
01:27:26.491,01:27:28.077,WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT.
01:27:28.118,01:27:32.956,A LIAR WHO THINKS HE CAN OPERATE UNDER THE COLOR OF THE LAW JUST LIKE HIS SON.
01:27:32.998,01:27:36.543,"YOU'RE A SHINED-UP WOODEN NICKEL, MR. PALMER."
01:27:36.585,01:27:39.171,A BULLY WITH A BIG BAG OF TRICKS.
01:27:39.213,01:27:47.221,"BUT UNLIKE YOU, I HAVE ONE SIMPLE BELIEF: THAT THE LAW IS THE ONLY THING CAPABLE OF MAKING PEOPLE EQUAL."
01:27:47.262,01:27:55.687,"NOW, YOU MAY THINK MARK BLACKWELL WAS WHITE TRASH, AND HE MAY VERY WELL HAVE BEEN, BUT IN THE EYES OF THE STATE, HIS LIFE MATTERS."
01:27:55.729,01:27:59.775,I'M GONNA IMPALE YOUR CLIENT ON A FIRST-DEGREE-MURDER CHARGE.
01:27:59.816,01:28:03.237,AND YOU GET A FRONT-ROW SEAT.
01:28:37.437,01:28:39.773,Joe: WHY ARE WE EVEN DOWN HERE?
01:28:39.815,01:28:42.484,"LIKE, IT IS NEVER A TORNADO."
01:28:42.525,01:28:44.945,BE HAPPY YOUR GRANDPA HAS A BASEMENT.
01:28:44.987,01:28:47.489,"Hank: OH, BOY."
01:28:47.530,01:28:50.159,"Dale: DON'T WORRY, EVERYONE."
01:28:54.871,01:28:56.706,"HEY, TURN THAT ON, UNCLE DALE."
01:28:56.748,01:28:58.750,"Eric: YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON?"
01:28:58.792,01:29:00.335,"YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA SHOW ME, MAN."
01:29:00.376,01:29:03.421,"COME ON, LET'S GO."
01:29:03.463,01:29:05.132,OKAY.
01:29:05.174,01:29:12.097,"CHARLES FRANCIS JENKINS FIRST INVENTED THE PROJECTOR ON JUNE 6, 1894, IN WAYNE COUNTY, INDIANA."
01:29:12.139,01:29:14.390,"DALE, CAN YOU SHOW THE MOVIE THAT YOU MADE?"
01:29:14.432,01:29:15.725,"OKAY, YUP."
01:29:15.767,01:29:17.602,HERE WE GO.
01:29:19.354,01:29:20.396,ALL RIGHT.
01:29:20.438,01:29:22.274,YAY!
01:29:22.316,01:29:23.692,"GOOD GOING, DALE."
01:29:23.733,01:29:24.901,"Glen: WOW, THAT LOOKS LIKE CHRISTMAS."
01:29:24.943,01:29:26.653,"Amy: AH, NICE!"
01:29:26.695,01:29:29.572,"OH, FAMILY CHRISTMAS."
01:29:33.118,01:29:34.328,THAT'S US.
01:29:35.204,01:29:36.579,THAT'S OUR FAMILY.
01:29:36.621,01:29:40.542,Judge: THERE IT IS.
01:29:43.253,01:29:44.546,"Joe: OH, GRANDMA."
01:29:44.587,01:29:46.131,THAT'S SWEET.
01:29:46.173,01:29:47.716,THAT'S SWEET.
01:29:47.757,01:29:49.259,"DAD, YOU WERE CUTE ONCE."
01:29:53.055,01:29:55.598,Dale: THERE'S HANK AND DAD.
01:29:55.640,01:29:56.892,UH-OH.
01:29:56.933,01:29:58.434,"Joe: JUDGE, YOU HAD HAIR?!"
01:29:58.476,01:30:00.478,"OH, LOOK AT YOU."
01:30:10.780,01:30:12.574,WHOO!
01:30:12.615,01:30:14.701,THERE YOU ARE!
01:30:14.743,01:30:17.787,"Glen: WATCH AND LEARN, BOYS!"
01:30:18.997,01:30:20.374,LOOK AT THAT.
01:30:20.414,01:30:21.833,OOH! WOW!
01:30:21.875,01:30:23.335,LOOK AT THAT ARM!
01:30:24.586,01:30:25.754,WHOA.
01:30:25.795,01:30:28.590,VICTORY.
01:30:28.631,01:30:31.260,Dale: THAT WAS THE BEST DAY.
01:30:32.677,01:30:34.888,PROUD MAMA.
01:30:34.930,01:30:36.890,"Joe: YEAH, DAD."
01:30:42.312,01:30:44.689,HOLY SHIT.
01:30:44.731,01:30:46.400,"Eric: SHUT UP, JOE."
01:30:52.655,01:30:54.032,TURN IT OFF!
01:30:54.074,01:30:55.700,"Glen: ALL RIGHT, SPEED IT UP, MAN."
01:30:55.742,01:30:57.660,Dale: I CAN'T.
01:30:57.702,01:30:59.537,I -- IT'S FILM.
01:30:57.702,01:31:01.081,"I CAN'T -- NEXT, NEXT!"
01:31:01.123,01:31:03.250,CRANK THE FUCKING THING WITH YOUR HAND IF YOU HAVE TO.
01:31:03.292,01:31:05.252,"LET'S GO, LET'S GO."
01:31:05.294,01:31:06.460,DALE!
01:31:06.502,01:31:07.963,OH! AH.
01:31:08.004,01:31:09.089,"OKAY, ALL RIGHT!"
01:31:09.131,01:31:10.464,ENOUGH!
01:31:10.506,01:31:11.841,"DALE, YOU UNDERSTAND?"
01:31:11.883,01:31:13.260,WE'RE GONNA FIX IT.
01:31:13.302,01:31:14.219,NOT IN THIS HOUSE!
01:31:14.261,01:31:16.805,Glen: DAD! SHIT!
01:31:16.846,01:31:18.514,"Dale: OH, NO."
01:31:18.556,01:31:22.060,THAT'S IT.
01:31:22.102,01:31:26.022,I'M TIRED OF THE WAY YOU DECIDE HOW THE WORLD IS GONNA RUN.
01:31:26.064,01:31:28.942,"WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA PARCEL OUT WHO GETS TO SAY AND DO WHAT AND WHEN YOU SAY IT?"
01:31:28.984,01:31:30.568,I DECIDE IN THIS HOUSE.
01:31:30.610,01:31:32.154,YOU CAN GO DECIDE IN YOUR HOUSE.
01:31:32.195,01:31:33.571,"NO, I CAN'T!"
01:31:33.613,01:31:38.534,BECAUSE I'M STUCK IN PURGATORY WITH A CLIENT WHO'S DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO BE FOUND GUILTY.
01:31:38.576,01:31:40.120,"YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT ANYWHERE NEAR THE MILL, DID YOU?"
01:31:40.162,01:31:41.955,"OKAY. OKAY, OKAY, OKAY."

01:33:24.307,01:33:26.893,"EVERYONE IN COURT WOULD APPLAUD, YOU'D MAKE SURE THEY DID."
01:33:26.935,01:33:28.602,YOU'D TELL THEM HOW PROUD YOU WERE.
01:33:28.644,01:33:31.647,PROUD OF FUCKING STRANGERS.

01:34:07.183,01:34:08.435,IT WOULDN'T HAVE HELPED YOU!
01:34:08.477,01:34:10.728,I DIDN'T NEED HELP.
01:34:10.770,01:34:13.398,"YOU WERE HIGH, YOU ROLLED THE CAR WITH YOUR BROTHER IN IT."
01:34:13.440,01:34:17.902,"HE HAD A MAJOR LEAGUE CAREER AHEAD OF HIM, A 90-MILE-AN-HOUR FASTBALL, AND HE RUNS A TIRE SHOP."
01:34:17.944,01:34:19.779,FUCK.

01:34:23.533,01:34:26.369,I WAS 17.
01:34:26.411,01:34:28.830,YOU WERE HEADED DOWN THE WRONG PATH.
01:34:28.871,01:34:31.874,I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.
01:34:31.916,01:34:34.127,"YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T JUST GRADUATE FROM LAW SCHOOL."
01:34:34.169,01:34:35.669,I GRADUATED FIRST IN MY CLASS.
01:34:35.711,01:34:38.173,GOOD.
01:34:38.214,01:34:40.634,"I DID REALLY WELL, DAD."
01:34:40.674,01:34:42.969,YOU'RE WELCOME.
01:34:48.558,01:34:50.143,TEAR THIS HOUSE DOWN.

01:36:29.951,01:36:31.578,"NO, THERE IS NOT."
01:36:31.620,01:36:34.830,BECAUSE CARLA'S FATHER WAS NEVER GONNA BE HER FATHER.
01:36:34.872,01:36:37.459,HIM KNOWING WOULD JUST COMPLICATE THINGS.
01:36:37.500,01:36:41.379,"THERE WAS NO WABASH RIVER FLOAT TRIP, THERE WAS NO EVERCLEAR AND KOOL-AID."
01:36:41.421,01:36:43.673,IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE LIES WE TELL OURSELVES...
01:36:43.715,01:36:46.008,"IN ORDER TO MOVE ON, AND WE DID."
01:36:46.050,01:36:48.010,"GREAT, I GET TO MOVE ON, TOO."
01:36:50.555,01:36:53.182,WHAT LIES YOU GONNA TELL ME?
01:36:56.978,01:37:04.193,THAT IT WAS FINE WITH ME WHEN YOU LEFT TO GO TO THAT GODDAMN CONCERT AND YOU NEVER CALLED AGAIN.
01:37:06.070,01:37:10.450,"THAT, UM..."
01:37:06.070,01:37:13.495,I AM ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE WITH CARLA NEVER KNOWING WHO HER FATHER IS.
01:37:16.289,01:37:21.877,THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S GONNA GET HURT WHEN YOU RUN AWAY AGAIN LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.
01:37:24.046,01:37:25.131,"OH, I KNOW THAT LOOK."
01:37:25.173,01:37:26.508,Hank: YOU'RE A BULLSHITTER.
01:37:26.549,01:37:28.259,"WELL, YEAH, IT'S MY BULLSHIT."
01:37:28.301,01:37:30.261,KINDLY REMOVE YOUR SHOES FROM IT.
01:37:32.597,01:37:34.349,SEE YOU IN 20 YEARS.
01:37:34.390,01:37:36.476,LOOKING FORWARD.

01:38:21.771,01:38:28.570,"SHE WAS 23 YEARS OLD WHEN I DROVE DOWN TO BARDSTOWN, KENTUCKY, 1979 TO BUY HER."
01:38:30.739,01:38:33.491,I ALMOST CRACKED THIS BABY OPEN A THOUSAND TIMES.
01:38:33.533,01:38:35.243,"YEAH, BE GLAD YOU DIDN'T."
01:38:35.284,01:38:38.120,YEP.
01:38:39.497,01:38:42.417,YOU GONNA TELL ME I SHOULDN'T DRINK?

01:39:02.103,01:39:05.064,WHERE'S -- DO YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE?
01:39:05.106,01:39:06.190,AFTER WE DIE?
01:39:06.232,01:39:09.318,YOU ASKING ME IF I BELIEVE IN GOD?
01:39:09.360,01:39:11.696,DO YOU?

01:39:14.407,01:39:16.659,WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?
01:39:18.661,01:39:23.207,"YOU KNOW, I WAS GONNA SAY THAT, UH..."
01:39:23.249,01:39:28.087,I WAS GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR BELITTLING YOUR MARRIAGE.
01:39:30.799,01:39:34.093,IT'S NOT EASY TO HAVE A GOOD MARRIAGE.
01:39:34.135,01:39:36.846,I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
01:39:36.888,01:39:39.140,LISA AND ALL.
01:39:39.181,01:39:43.728,"I-I-I DON'T KNOW, HENRY."

01:41:30.835,01:41:32.795,I DON'T KNOW WHICH PRAYER CARD THE JUDGE WOULD LIKE.
01:41:32.837,01:41:34.839,"MAYBE ST. JOSEPH, BECAUSE HE'S THE PATRON SAINT OF FATHERS."
01:41:34.881,01:41:37.050,"OKAY, OKAY, DALE!"
01:41:34.881,01:41:38.718,"AND THERE'S A ST. JOSEPH -- ALL RIGHT, DIAL DOWN THE CRAZY NOW."

01:42:29.142,01:42:30.686,"YEAH, WELL, HE'S YOUR FATHER, YOU SHOULD BE HERE."
01:42:30.728,01:42:32.772,"OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE NUTS."
01:42:32.814,01:42:35.733,I NEVER ASKED YOU FOR A GODDAMN THING.
01:42:35.775,01:42:39.946,OKAY?
01:42:39.988,01:42:42.531,YOU CANNOT LOSE THIS CASE.

01:42:51.624,01:42:53.250,DON'T PAT ME.
01:42:53.292,01:42:55.670,"I'M THE BIG BROTHER HERE, YOU DON'T PAT ME."
01:42:58.047,01:43:01.300,"DAD WANTS TO SEE YOU, HANK."

01:43:23.739,01:43:25.491,"PLEASE, DON'T EVER SAY THAT AGAIN."
01:43:25.533,01:43:27.451,DON'T SAY THAT TO ANYBODY.
01:43:27.493,01:43:29.453,I RAN THAT MAN DOWN.
01:43:29.495,01:43:30.997,YOU'RE SPECULATING.
01:43:31.039,01:43:32.373,"I KNOW YOU, TOO."
01:43:32.414,01:43:37.128,YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE OF OVERRIDING A LIFETIME OF ETHICAL SUPERIORITY.
01:43:38.838,01:43:41.716,"I DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO FIGHT WITH YOU, HENRY."
01:43:41.757,01:43:43.300,THEN MUSTER SOME.
01:43:43.342,01:43:45.178,DO YOU REMEMBER HITTING HIM?
01:43:45.218,01:43:47.555,JUST A MATTER OF TIME.
01:43:47.596,01:43:50.349,CLOCK'S RUN OUT.
01:43:50.391,01:43:52.351,YOU'RE NOT TAKING THE STAND.
01:43:52.393,01:43:56.229,"THEN, UH, I'LL FIRE YOU AND C.P. WILL DO IT."
01:43:56.271,01:44:01.819,YOU ARE THE MOST BRUTALLY BULLHEADED CLIENT I'VE EVER HAD.
01:44:01.861,01:44:03.779,THIS IS EASY.
01:44:03.821,01:44:07.116,THE PROSECUTION CAN'T PROVE YOU HIT HIM ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN.
01:44:07.158,01:44:09.994,I'VE SPRAYED REASONABLE DOUBT ALL OVER THIS CASE.
01:44:10.036,01:44:13.455,"PLEASE, JUST -- WILL YOU JUST LET ME DO MY JOB, LET ME DO THE TALKING."
01:44:13.497,01:44:15.666,KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

01:44:35.895,01:44:38.147,"OKAY, SO..."
01:44:38.189,01:44:43.694,"YOU'RE GONNA SWEAR IN, HAND TO GOD, AND LIE UNDER OATH THAT YOU REMEMBER HITTING HIM?"
01:44:43.736,01:44:49.242,"I WON'T CONFESS TO SOMETHING I DON'T REMEMBER DOING, OKAY?"
01:44:49.282,01:44:50.283,YOU PROMISE?
01:44:50.325,01:44:51.619,THANK YOU.

01:44:52.828,01:44:54.038,ALL RIGHT.
01:44:52.828,01:44:56.249,"I'M SORRY, I JUST -- I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT."
01:45:35.037,01:45:37.330,Gus: JUDGE PALMER.
01:45:39.708,01:45:47.424,"YOU SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, SO HELP YOU GOD?"
01:45:47.466,01:45:48.801,I DO.
01:46:09.238,01:46:11.824,"JUDGE PALMER, YOU'VE BEEN ON THE BENCH HOW LONG?"
01:46:11.866,01:46:14.076,42 YEARS.
01:46:14.118,01:46:16.162,"SIR, HOW MANY VIOLENT CRIMES HAVE YOU RULED ON IN THAT TIME?"
01:46:16.204,01:46:17.830,Dickham: OBJECTION.
01:46:17.872,01:46:20.666,THE DEFENDANT'S HISTORY AS A JUDGE IS NOT RELEVANT.
01:46:20.708,01:46:26.881,"YOUR HONOR, THE STATE HAS INTRODUCED EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS SOME MOTIVE FOR THE ALLEGED CRIME RELATED TO THE JUDGE'S DUTIES."
01:46:26.922,01:46:29.382,I'M ENTITLED TO REBUT THAT LAUGHABLE PRESUMPTION.
01:46:29.424,01:46:30.718,OVERRULED.
01:46:32.803,01:46:35.556,"IT'S, UH, NOT SOMETHING I KEEP TRACK OF."
01:46:35.597,01:46:41.103,WOULD IT SURPRISE YOU TO LEARN THAT YOU PRESIDED OVER 17 MURDER TRIALS?
01:46:41.145,01:46:43.396,434 ASSAULTS...
01:46:43.438,01:46:46.650,"12,942 CIVIL CASES."
01:46:46.692,01:46:49.778,Judge: IT WOULD NOT.
01:46:49.820,01:46:51.364,DID YOU RUN OVER ANY OF THOSE FOLKS?
01:46:51.404,01:46:52.531,OBJECTION.
01:46:52.573,01:46:54.407,"REIN IT IN, MR. PALMER."
01:46:58.411,01:47:00.331,JUST LOST YOUR WIFE?
01:47:00.373,01:47:01.456,YES.
01:47:01.498,01:47:03.209,HOW LONG WERE YOU MARRIED?
01:47:03.251,01:47:04.919,50 YEARS.
01:47:04.960,01:47:06.795,HOW DID SHE PASS?
01:47:09.173,01:47:11.884,SHE SPENT THE MORNING KNEELING.
01:47:11.926,01:47:14.636,SHE FUSSED OVER HER HYDRANGEAS.
01:47:14.678,01:47:19.975,A BLOOD CLOT FORMED IN HER LEFT LEG AND WENT TO HER HEART.
01:47:20.017,01:47:23.062,"THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, WHAT DID YOU DO THAT MORNING?"
01:47:23.104,01:47:26.274,I BURIED YOUR MOTHER.
01:47:26.315,01:47:28.943,TOUGH DAY.
01:47:28.984,01:47:30.819,TIRED.
01:47:30.861,01:47:33.197,TIRED.
01:47:33.239,01:47:35.908,"DARK, RAINING."
01:47:35.950,01:47:37.910,DO YOU REMEMBER HITTING THE VICTIM?
01:47:37.952,01:47:39.745,I DO NOT.
01:47:39.787,01:47:42.331,THANK YOU.
01:47:42.373,01:47:44.666,NOTHING FURTHER.
01:47:47.086,01:47:51.632,WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU DISLIKED MARK BLACKWELL?
01:47:51.673,01:47:53.134,YES.
01:47:53.175,01:47:55.010,WISHED HIM ILL?
01:47:55.052,01:47:57.638,I DID.
01:47:57.679,01:48:00.308,DEAD?
01:48:00.349,01:48:02.977,YES.
01:48:10.818,01:48:17.116,"UH, DEPUTY HANSON TESTIFIED THAT YOU TOLD HIM THAT ONLY YOU WERE ALLOWED TO DRIVE THAT CAR."
01:48:17.158,01:48:19.410,NOT EVEN YOUR LATE WIFE.
01:48:19.452,01:48:20.869,IT'S MY CAR.
01:48:20.911,01:48:28.669,"BUT NOW A MAN'S BLOOD, A MAN THAT YOU HATE, WAS FOUND ON A CAR THAT ONLY YOU DRIVE."
01:48:28.710,01:48:30.796,BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOT THERE.
01:48:30.838,01:48:32.547,I DO NOT. NO.
01:48:32.589,01:48:39.805,"A 6'1, 220-POUND MAN -- THAT'S A PRETTY BIG OL' BOY, ON A STEEL BICYCLE."
01:48:39.847,01:48:42.975,BUT YOU'RE IN THE DARK ABOUT IT ALL.
01:48:43.017,01:48:45.227,OBJECTION.
01:48:45.269,01:48:46.687,OVERRULED.
01:48:46.728,01:48:47.980,CORRECT.
01:48:48.022,01:48:51.359,SO ON ONE OF THE WORST DAYS OF YOUR LIFE...
01:48:51.400,01:48:53.235,YOU ENTER THE MINI MART...
01:48:53.277,01:48:55.279,YOU SEE A MAN YOU HATE...
01:48:55.321,01:48:57.031,OBJECTION.
01:48:57.072,01:48:58.866,LET HIM FINISH.
01:48:58.907,01:49:22.473,"YOU SEE A MAN THAT YOU HATE, AND MINUTES LATER, YOU'VE ALTERED YOUR ROUTE, AND BOTH YOU AND THAT MAN ARE ON THE SAME ROAD AT THE SAME TIME, ONLY YOU'RE IN YOUR CAR WITH HIS BLOOD ON IT, AND HE'S IN A RAVINE WITH HIS KIDNEYS RUPTURED AND HIS BACK BROKEN, AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER HITTING HIM?"
01:49:22.515,01:49:25.142,I DO NOT.
01:49:25.184,01:49:27.061,AH.
01:49:27.102,01:49:38.280,"SO YOU'RE TELLING THIS COURT UNDER OATH, WHICH I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN MOST, THAT A-A MAN WHO KILLED SOMEBODY ON YOUR WATCH..."
01:49:38.322,01:49:41.616,A MAN YOU RELEASED...
01:49:41.658,01:49:45.246,WHO DROWNED A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL...
01:49:45.287,01:49:48.707,A MAN THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY HATE...
01:49:48.749,01:49:55.339,"ON THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE, AND YOU HAVE THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO BALANCE THE SCALES OF JUSTICE..."
01:49:55.381,01:50:00.261,AND YOUR TESTIMONY IS THAT YOU DIDN'T SEIZE THAT CHANCE AND KILL HIM.
01:50:00.302,01:50:02.846,NO.
01:50:08.561,01:50:10.645,NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.
01:50:12.689,01:50:14.942,THAT'S NOT MY TESTIMONY.
01:50:29.957,01:50:34.086,"SIR, HOW HAVE I MISCHARACTERIZED YOUR TESTIMONY?"
01:50:34.128,01:50:35.921,OBJECTION.
01:50:35.963,01:50:38.382,YOUR HONOR?
01:50:38.424,01:50:41.885,MY TESTIMONY IS...
01:50:41.927,01:50:44.430,THAT I DON'T REMEMBER HITTING HIM.
01:50:44.472,01:50:47.057,"YOUR HONOR, MAY I -- MAY I REQUEST A BRIEF RECESS?"
01:50:47.099,01:50:48.517,DENIED.
01:50:56.691,01:50:59.612,MR. PALMER...
01:50:59.694,01:51:01.280,JUDGE PALMER...
01:51:03.698,01:51:07.995,...DO YOU THINK YOU KILLED HIM INTENTIONALLY?
01:51:08.036,01:51:09.997,OBJECTION.
01:51:10.038,01:51:11.081,MOVE TO STRIKE.
01:51:13.041,01:51:14.585,YES.
01:51:18.422,01:51:20.841,Judge Warren: ORDER.
01:51:20.882,01:51:23.511,"ORDER, ORDER!"
01:51:30.142,01:51:32.436,"THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR, NO FURTHER QUESTIONS."
01:51:41.820,01:51:45.115,"REDIRECT, JUDGE?"
01:51:45.157,01:51:47.618,OKAY.
01:51:47.660,01:51:50.745,"SO, YOU THINK YOU DID IT?"
01:51:50.787,01:51:52.956,CORRECT.
01:51:52.998,01:51:55.000,BUT NOT BECAUSE YOU REMEMBER HITTING HIM.
01:51:55.042,01:51:56.751,THAT'S RIGHT.
01:51:56.793,01:52:00.464,"NO, YOUR OPINION IS YOU HIT HIM ON PURPOSE."
01:52:00.506,01:52:02.757,CORRECT?
01:52:02.799,01:52:05.052,WHY DO YOU THINK YOU CAN'T REMEMBER THE ACCIDENT?
01:52:05.093,01:52:07.971,MY WIFE JUST DIED.
01:52:08.013,01:52:10.265,UNDERGOING ANY MEDICAL TREATMENT?
01:52:10.307,01:52:12.100,OBJECTION.
01:52:12.142,01:52:14.395,"GOES TO STATE OF MIND, YOUR HONOR."
01:52:16.230,01:52:18.273,YOU AND I ARE FINALLY DONE.
01:52:18.315,01:52:19.608,"OH, WE'RE NOT DONE."
01:52:19.650,01:52:20.859,"C.P., YOU'RE UP."
01:52:20.901,01:52:22.611,"SIT DOWN, MR. KENNEDY."
01:52:22.653,01:52:24.321,YOU'RE DONE WHEN YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION.
01:52:24.363,01:52:25.822,"OH, NO, NO, NO, NO."
01:52:25.864,01:52:27.700,"NO, NO! YOU'RE NOT MY LAWYER!"
01:52:27.740,01:52:29.535,YOU'RE ON THE STAND AS A WITNESS.
01:52:29.577,01:52:32.954,"I'M OF SOUND MIND AND BODY, AND IT'S NONE OF YOUR GODDAMN BUSINESS -- GENTLEMEN."
01:52:32.996,01:52:33.955,SIT DOWN!
01:52:33.997,01:52:35.624,QUIET.
01:52:35.666,01:52:36.709,SIT DOWN!
01:52:36.749,01:52:39.836,GENTLEMEN!
01:52:39.878,01:52:43.716,IT'S YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK OTHER COUNSEL IF YOU SO CHOOSE.
01:52:43.756,01:52:47.553,BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO DO SO AFTER YOU'VE COMPLETED YOUR TESTIMONY.
01:52:47.595,01:52:50.097,"YES, SIR."
01:52:51.515,01:52:55.810,Hank: I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN: UNDERGOING ANY MEDICAL TREATMENT?
01:52:55.852,01:52:57.312,YES OR NO?
01:52:57.354,01:53:00.023,CHEMOTHERAPY.
01:53:01.400,01:53:03.402,FOR HOW LONG?
01:53:03.444,01:53:04.945,SIX MONTHS.
01:53:04.986,01:53:07.239,"CHEMO, THAT'S CANCER."
01:53:07.281,01:53:09.450,YES.
01:53:10.825,01:53:12.911,IT'S ADVANCED.
01:53:14.787,01:53:19.501,DID YOUR DOCTOR CAUTION YOU AGAINST THE POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY?
01:53:19.543,01:53:20.502,"YES, HE DID."
01:53:20.544,01:53:21.836,WHAT ARE THEY?
01:53:21.878,01:53:27.842,"NAUSEA, FATIGUE, LOSS OF APPETITE -- DELUSIONS, FITS OF ANGER, DEPRESSION, MEMORY LOSS?"
01:53:27.884,01:53:30.011,"YEAH, BUT NONE OF THAT APPLIES TO ME."
01:53:30.053,01:53:31.680,REALLY?
01:53:31.722,01:53:37.770,WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ALL THE CASES YOU PRESIDED OVER IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS IF IT WERE DETERMINED THAT YOUR MENTAL ACTUALITY WAS DIMINISHED?
01:53:37.810,01:53:40.439,OBJECTION! COUNSEL IS TRYING TO PREJUDICE THE JURY.
01:53:40.481,01:53:43.609,Judge Warren: OVERRULED.
01:53:43.651,01:53:46.903,"THEY WOULD BE DECLARED MISTRIALS, WOULD THEY NOT?"
01:53:46.945,01:53:48.863,"POTENTIALLY, YES."
01:53:48.905,01:53:51.074,A STAIN ON YOUR REPUTATION.
01:53:51.116,01:53:53.410,"YOU'D DO ANYTHING TO AVOID THAT, WOULD YOU NOT?"
01:53:53.452,01:53:58.457,"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!"
01:53:58.499,01:54:01.293,SEEING BLACKWELL THAT NIGHT?
01:54:01.335,01:54:03.128,I REMEMBER HIM.
01:54:03.170,01:54:06.799,"I JUST DON'T RECALL, UH..."
01:54:06.839,01:54:09.009,HITTING THAT SON-OF-A-BITCH.
01:54:09.050,01:54:11.219,WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER?
01:54:11.261,01:54:14.389,"I REMEMBER HE, UH..."
01:54:14.431,01:54:17.601,OPENED HIS DISGUSTING MOUTH.
01:54:20.895,01:54:23.190,WHAT COULD HE POSSIBLY HAVE SAID?
01:54:36.537,01:54:40.123,"Mark: HEY, JUDGE!"
01:54:40.165,01:54:42.501,SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR WIFE.
01:54:42.543,01:54:44.837,YOU KNOW...
01:54:46.672,01:54:50.509,...SHE AIN'T BURIED MORE THAN 50 FEET FROM HOPE.
01:54:50.551,01:54:54.513,I'M NOT GONNA HAVE TO WALK TOO FAR TO PISS ON BOTH GRAVES.
01:55:10.028,01:55:12.447,HE GOT 'EM.
01:55:18.245,01:55:19.705,NO.
01:55:22.332,01:55:24.000,IT DOESN'T ADD UP.
01:55:26.169,01:55:28.171,I DON'T BUY IT.
01:55:28.213,01:55:29.964,IT CAN'T BE THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE'S INSULTED YOU.
01:55:30.006,01:55:31.425,IT'S YOUR JOB.
01:55:31.466,01:55:34.219,WHY DID YOU GO EASY ON HIM THE FIRST TIME?
01:55:34.261,01:55:41.351,"OF ALL THE JUDGES IN INDIANA, THE ONE WITH THE TIGHTEST -- YOU GAVE HIM 30 DAYS."
01:55:41.393,01:55:44.563,"HE THREATENED HER, DISCHARGED A FIREARM AT HER RESIDENCE."
01:55:44.605,01:55:46.648,THAT'S SIX MONTHS.
01:55:46.690,01:55:48.400,EASY.
01:55:48.442,01:55:50.360,WHAT WAS YOUR REASONING?
01:55:50.402,01:55:52.404,"180 DAYS, THAT'S SOLID."
01:55:52.446,01:55:54.740,MAYBE HE'D HAVE COOLED OFF.
01:55:54.782,01:55:58.619,MAYBE HE DOESN'T KILL HOPE.
01:55:58.660,01:56:08.670,"OF ALL THE YEARS YOU SAT ON THAT BENCH, ALL THE PEOPLE THAT STOOD BEFORE YOU, THE LENIENCY, THE UNDERSTANDING, THE FREE RIDE GOES TO MARK BLACKWELL?"
01:56:08.712,01:56:11.381,HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT LAPSE IN JUDGMENT?
01:56:17.387,01:56:21.642,I LOOKED AT HIM AND SAW YOU.
01:56:23.143,01:56:26.980,SAME WILLFUL DISOBEDIENCE...
01:56:27.021,01:56:30.442,SAME RECKLESSNESS.
01:56:30.484,01:56:36.239,I LOOKED AT HIM AND SAW MY MIDDLE SON.
01:56:36.281,01:56:38.325,MY LITTLE BOY.
01:56:39.701,01:56:41.703,My little boy.
01:56:45.332,01:56:47.041,I WATCHED HIM CRY RIGHT THERE.
01:56:47.083,01:56:52.380,I WANTED TO PUT MY ARMS AROUND HIM AND TELL HIM IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS.
01:56:52.422,01:56:55.676,I WANTED SOMEONE TO HELP HIM...
01:56:55.717,01:56:58.971,LIKE I'D WANT SOMEONE TO HELP MY BOY...
01:57:04.726,01:57:07.312,...IF HE LOST HIS WAY.
01:57:11.024,01:57:14.611,IT WAS MY CHANCE TO BE...
01:57:16.655,01:57:19.741,...THAT SOMEONE.
01:57:19.783,01:57:21.159,MAYBE SO.
01:57:21.201,01:57:22.452,I HAVE MEMORIES.
01:57:24.538,01:57:26.832,OF US.
01:57:26.874,01:57:28.166,"YOU, ME."
01:57:29.417,01:57:31.795,THEN I DON'T.
01:57:34.047,01:57:35.382,HOW COME?
01:57:37.509,01:57:40.721,WHY?
01:57:40.762,01:57:42.890,WHY?
01:57:42.931,01:57:45.017,WHY?
01:57:48.478,01:57:50.731,I LOOKED AT YOU AND I SAW HIM.
01:57:57.029,01:57:59.489,"YOUR HONOR, MAY THE DEPUTY PLEASE APPROACH?"
01:58:07.581,01:58:10.333,LAST QUESTION: THIS MAN'S BEEN YOUR BAILIFF FOR 22 YEARS.
01:58:10.375,01:58:11.710,WHAT IS HIS NAME?
01:58:18.132,01:58:20.886,Gus.
01:58:24.097,01:58:25.807,YOU DON'T KNOW?
01:58:31.187,01:58:35.025,"I'D LIKE TO GO HOME NOW, YEAH?"
01:58:38.612,01:58:40.363,"NOTHING FURTHER, YOUR HONOR."
01:58:59.507,01:59:01.384,HEY.
01:59:03.344,01:59:06.640,ARE YOU OKAY?
01:59:06.681,01:59:08.809,DEPENDS ON THE VERDICT.
01:59:13.105,01:59:15.774,"I'M CARLA'S DAD, RIGHT?"
01:59:15.816,01:59:17.275,THIS AGAIN?
01:59:17.317,01:59:19.653,WHY -- WHY -- WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LET IT GO?
01:59:19.694,01:59:21.362,SHE'S FINE.
01:59:21.404,01:59:24.116,"I MEAN, IT'S OBVIOUS, SHE WAS BORN NINE MONTHS AFTER I SPLIT."
01:59:24.157,01:59:25.784,EITHER THAT OR YOU CHEATED ON ME.
01:59:25.826,01:59:27.577,"YOU KNOW, EITHER WAY IT'S NOT FINE."
01:59:27.619,01:59:29.997,IT'S JUST ONE VERSION IS SLIGHTLY LESS NOT FINE THAN THE OTHER.
01:59:30.038,01:59:31.790,AND THE THING IS...
01:59:31.832,01:59:33.750,LISTEN.
