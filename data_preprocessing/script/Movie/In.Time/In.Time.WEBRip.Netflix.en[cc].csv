00:01:01.854,00:01:04.606,WILL: I don't have time.
00:01:04.606,00:01:08.193,I don't have time to worry about how it happened.
00:01:08.193,00:01:10.654,It is what it is.
00:01:10.654,00:01:15.283,We're genetically engineered to stop aging at 25.
00:01:15.283,00:01:21.999,"The trouble is, we live only one more year unless we can get more time."
00:01:24.376,00:01:28.338,Time is now the currency.
00:01:28.338,00:01:31.842,We earn it and spend it.
00:01:31.842,00:01:35.054,The rich can live forever.
00:01:35.054,00:01:38.097,And the rest of us?
00:01:38.097,00:01:42.310,I just want to wake up with more time on my hand than hours in the day.
00:02:13.467,00:02:14.802,"Hey, Mom."
00:02:14.802,00:02:16.762,You got in late last night.
00:02:16.762,00:02:18.639,I put in some overtime.
00:02:18.639,00:02:21.266,Where'd it go?
00:02:21.266,00:02:24.478,They drink it in New Greenwich.
00:02:24.478,00:02:26.647,Fifty?
00:02:26.647,00:02:29.066,That's right.
00:02:29.066,00:02:31.234,Twenty-five for the 25th time.
00:02:31.234,00:02:33.779,"Oh, I was sure I'd have a grandchild by now."
00:02:33.779,00:02:35.280,Here we go.
00:02:35.280,00:02:37.240,Bela's daughter is always asking about you.
00:02:37.240,00:02:41.120,Who has time for a girlfriend?
00:02:41.120,00:02:42.913,What do you got?
00:02:42.913,00:02:45.791,Three days.
00:02:45.791,00:02:47.626,We owe half that in rent.
00:02:47.626,00:02:50.504,Eight for the electric and we're still late on that loan.
00:02:50.504,00:02:54.008,"I can make extra on the side, you know."
00:02:54.008,00:02:56.927,I could...
00:02:57.886,00:02:59.138,Nobody wins.
00:02:59.138,00:03:00.514,Yeah.
00:03:01.765,00:03:03.350,"Remember, I'm not here tonight."
00:03:03.350,00:03:05.226,I got two days' work in the garment district.
00:03:05.226,00:03:07.228,I know.
00:03:07.228,00:03:09.898,"After I pay off the loan, I won't have long."
00:03:09.898,00:03:11.817,Will...
00:03:11.817,00:03:14.945,I just wouldn't know what to do if I lost you.
00:03:14.945,00:03:16.738,I'm late.
00:03:16.738,00:03:20.159,Let me give you 30 minutes so you can have a decent lunch.
00:03:33.505,00:03:36.341,I love you.
00:03:36.341,00:03:39.260,"Happy birthday, Mom."
00:03:39.260,00:03:42.263,"When you get back, we're going to celebrate."
00:03:51.356,00:03:53.067,GIRL: Will!
00:03:53.067,00:03:55.944,Will! You got a minute?
00:03:55.944,00:03:58.822,"What are you talking about, Mya?"
00:03:58.822,00:04:00.949,Not a year I can use yet.
00:04:00.949,00:04:04.244,"Come on, Will."
00:04:06.205,00:04:08.582,"Here, take five minutes."
00:04:13.045,00:04:14.713,Get out of here.
00:04:28.018,00:04:31.063,Four minutes for a cup of coffee?
00:04:31.063,00:04:32.689,"Yesterday, it was three."
00:04:32.689,00:04:34.733,You want coffee or you want to reminisce?
00:04:34.733,00:04:36.568,Two coffees.
00:04:39.113,00:04:42.282,"How many shifts you got today, Borel?"
00:04:42.282,00:04:45.202,Really excited about it.
00:04:45.202,00:04:49.873,"If you had any of your father in you, we could make a fortune."
00:04:49.873,00:04:52.209,I don't fight.
00:04:55.545,00:04:58.590,There's another one.
00:05:31.706,00:05:34.334,"Whoa, what is this?"
00:05:34.334,00:05:35.585,Never met the quota.
00:05:35.585,00:05:37.212,My units are up from last week.
00:05:37.212,00:05:40.299,So's the quota. Next.
00:05:40.299,00:05:43.718,Next.
00:06:00.694,00:06:02.029,"You in, Will?"
00:06:02.029,00:06:04.405,I don't have time to gamble anymore.
00:06:04.405,00:06:06.658,"Oh, thank God."
00:06:06.658,00:06:09.744,"Because ever since you stopped playing, I started winning."
00:06:09.744,00:06:12.789,You still owe me an hour.
00:06:12.789,00:06:14.791,You seen Borel?
00:06:22.007,00:06:24.759,Will!
00:06:24.759,00:06:26.053,Your wife's looking for you.
00:06:26.053,00:06:28.180,You're not gonna believe it.
00:06:28.180,00:06:31.350,This madman's been buying drinks all night.
00:06:32.600,00:06:34.477,"Come on, let me get you home."
00:06:34.477,00:06:37.147,Soon as I finish this drink.
00:06:37.147,00:06:39.358,Hey! You!
00:06:39.358,00:06:41.109,You!
00:06:41.109,00:06:43.111,More everything!
00:06:45.739,00:06:47.824,Do you want to come home with me?
00:06:47.824,00:06:50.451,You can take us both home.
00:06:58.585,00:07:00.795,Excuse me.
00:07:00.795,00:07:02.714,You need to get out of here.
00:07:02.714,00:07:04.632,Somebody's gonna clean that clock.
00:07:04.632,00:07:08.303,Yes!
00:07:08.303,00:07:11.973,"I mean, they aren't going to rob you."
00:07:11.973,00:07:14.976,They can't take that much time and let you live to tell about it.
00:07:14.976,00:07:16.811,Yes.
00:07:16.811,00:07:19.940,I don't think you understand.
00:07:26.654,00:07:29.324,BOREL: Will. Will!
00:07:29.324,00:07:31.243,Minutemen!
00:07:31.243,00:07:33.578,Minutemen!
00:07:33.578,00:07:35.830,Those gangsters aren't playing around.
00:07:38.375,00:07:40.127,"Wait, wait."
00:07:40.127,00:07:44.047,He's asking for it.
00:07:44.047,00:07:46.674,You think he'd help us?
00:07:46.674,00:07:49.219,Don't worry. I won't do anything stupid.
00:07:49.219,00:07:51.805,Go.
00:07:56.559,00:07:58.478,The name's Fortis.
00:08:00.021,00:08:04.276,"And that, sir, is a very nice watch."
00:08:07.528,00:08:11.408,Do you mind if I try it on?
00:08:13.785,00:08:16.288,FORTIS: I'll tell you what.
00:08:16.288,00:08:19.791,I'll fight you for it.
00:08:19.791,00:08:22.085,Come on.
00:08:22.085,00:08:25.464,I'm an old man.
00:08:34.473,00:08:36.057,I need a moment.
00:08:51.406,00:08:53.908,You ready to go?
00:08:55.410,00:08:56.828,Ready to go.
00:09:00.415,00:09:02.125,Let's get you out of here.
00:09:04.669,00:09:06.754,Get him!
00:09:06.754,00:09:10.758,Stop. What are you doing?
00:09:10.758,00:09:13.261,"Yeah, it looked like it."
00:09:14.471,00:09:15.889,I know what I'm doing.
00:09:15.889,00:09:18.141,Run. Run!
00:09:29.944,00:09:32.364,Come on!
00:09:32.364,00:09:34.282,Here!
00:09:36.368,00:09:37.994,Hurry!
00:09:42.374,00:09:44.584,WILL: Move!
00:09:54.052,00:09:57.138,Where the hell are you going?
00:10:39.013,00:10:41.433,I know who took him.
00:10:41.433,00:10:43.477,I know who he is.
00:10:45.770,00:10:48.064,Who he was.
00:10:54.904,00:10:57.282,"Damn it, damn it."
00:10:59.867,00:11:02.954,What the hell are you doing here?
00:11:02.954,00:11:05.123,Flashing all that?
00:11:05.123,00:11:07.584,You out of your mind?
00:11:07.584,00:11:09.877,Henry Hamilton.
00:11:11.963,00:11:14.174,Will Salas.
00:11:23.600,00:11:24.767,God.
00:11:24.767,00:11:26.853,"Drink more, it gets better."
00:11:33.776,00:11:35.236,Not much better.
00:11:40.867,00:11:42.536,You'll be safe till morning.
00:11:42.536,00:11:44.621,I'll get you out of here.
00:11:45.913,00:11:47.541,You're from New Greenwich.
00:11:48.791,00:11:50.460,Does it show?
00:11:50.460,00:11:52.711,Nah.
00:11:59.093,00:12:01.555,Looks like you could use some help yourself.
00:12:01.555,00:12:03.348,"No, thanks."
00:12:03.348,00:12:05.058,How old are you?
00:12:05.058,00:12:07.018,In real time?
00:12:07.018,00:12:09.437,Twenty-eight.
00:12:09.437,00:12:11.814,I'm 105.
00:12:11.814,00:12:14.025,Good for you.
00:12:14.025,00:12:17.278,"You won't see 106, you have too many more nights like tonight."
00:12:17.278,00:12:19.531,You are right.
00:12:21.282,00:12:24.785,But the day comes when you've had enough.
00:12:24.785,00:12:28.289,"Your mind can be spent, even if your body's not."
00:12:30.625,00:12:33.670,We want to die.
00:12:33.670,00:12:35.213,We need to.
00:12:38.717,00:12:42.929,That's your problem?
00:12:45.139,00:12:47.808,You ever known anyone who's died?
00:12:54.274,00:12:57.527,"For a few to be immortal, many must die."
00:13:01.906,00:13:04.783,What the hell is that supposed to mean?
00:13:06.911,00:13:09.122,"You really don't know, do you?"
00:13:10.915,00:13:14.335,Everyone can't live forever.
00:13:17.213,00:13:20.967,Why do you think there are Time Zones?
00:13:20.967,00:13:26.723,Why do you think taxes and prices go up the same day in the ghetto?
00:13:26.723,00:13:30.101,The cost of living keeps rising to make sure people keep dying.
00:13:31.561,00:13:35.148,How else could there be men with a million years while most live day to day?
00:13:39.319,00:13:43.948,But the truth is there's more than enough.
00:13:45.992,00:13:49.828,No one has to die before their time.
00:13:56.753,00:14:05.470,"If you had as much time as I have on that clock, what would you do with it?"
00:14:09.557,00:14:10.975,I'd stop watching it.
00:14:14.270,00:14:17.273,I can tell you one thing.
00:14:17.273,00:14:22.487,"If I had all that time, I sure as hell wouldn't waste it."
00:14:30.537,00:14:32.246,Get some rest.
00:14:35.834,00:14:38.211,Don't worry. I won't take it in the night.
00:14:38.211,00:14:40.714,And I won't take yours.
00:14:54.977,00:14:57.104,It does get better.
00:16:59.435,00:17:01.813,"Oh, hey, Will."
00:17:03.147,00:17:06.985,Is Borel in?
00:17:06.985,00:17:08.528,Look at that.
00:17:08.528,00:17:11.238,A shame we gotta wait 25 years.
00:17:11.238,00:17:13.700,We could use that year right now.
00:17:13.700,00:17:15.034,Borel?
00:17:17.662,00:17:20.331,I'm here.
00:17:21.541,00:17:23.877,"You'd better get her inside, Greta."
00:17:32.051,00:17:34.178,Look at this.
00:17:36.096,00:17:38.474,Where did you get that?
00:17:38.474,00:17:40.852,The guy at the bar.
00:17:40.852,00:17:43.021,They were going to kill him.
00:17:43.021,00:17:46.190,He gave it to me.
00:17:46.190,00:17:48.526,He timed himself out before I could stop him.
00:17:48.526,00:17:51.070,No one gives anybody 100 years.
00:17:51.070,00:17:53.489,He didn't just give me this.
00:17:53.489,00:17:54.908,He gave me the truth about it.
00:17:54.908,00:17:56.617,You can't let anyone see that.
00:17:56.617,00:17:57.952,Hey.
00:17:57.952,00:18:00.580,You know that time will get you killed.
00:18:06.544,00:18:08.128,How long have we been friends?
00:18:09.213,00:18:11.173,"What, 10 years?"
00:18:11.173,00:18:12.717,Here.
00:18:19.139,00:18:20.600,A decade.
00:18:22.685,00:18:24.520,You've been like a brother.
00:18:26.773,00:18:28.691,Where are you going?
00:18:28.691,00:18:32.236,Where this won't look out of place.
00:18:32.236,00:18:35.155,I finally got the time to take my mom to New Greenwich.
00:18:52.966,00:18:55.134,"Greta, I'm going out!"
00:18:55.134,00:18:59.597,"COMPUTER VOICE: Loan payment received, two days. Thank you."
00:19:07.187,00:19:08.564,Dayton.
00:19:08.564,00:19:10.066,Two hours.
00:19:13.527,00:19:14.988,It's always been an hour.
00:19:14.988,00:19:17.323,Now it's two.
00:19:17.323,00:19:18.574,Since when?
00:19:18.574,00:19:21.119,Since today.
00:19:21.119,00:19:23.621,My son is meeting me.
00:19:23.621,00:19:25.372,"I can't do that, policy."
00:19:27.083,00:19:28.542,Please?
00:19:29.543,00:19:31.921,It's a two-hour walk.
00:19:34.924,00:19:37.135,I have an hour and a half.
00:19:39.679,00:19:42.181,Then you'd better run.
00:20:14.088,00:20:18.843,Stop! Please stop!
00:20:49.289,00:20:53.794,Wait! Please!
00:20:53.794,00:20:57.506,Wait! No! Please!
00:21:17.818,00:21:19.112,Mom?
00:21:19.112,00:21:20.529,Will!
00:21:24.450,00:21:26.702,Will!
00:21:26.702,00:21:29.038,Will!
00:21:41.300,00:21:44.344,"No, no, no, no!"
00:21:55.231,00:21:57.650,No!
00:21:57.650,00:22:00.194,"Mom, Mom, Mom!"
00:22:25.970,00:22:27.263,MAN: Thirteen zeros.
00:22:27.263,00:22:30.432,Unlucky for all.
00:22:30.432,00:22:35.771,"The last time anyone saw him alive, there was over a century on that clock."
00:22:35.771,00:22:37.857,"Around here, they'd kill you for a week."
00:22:37.857,00:22:39.733,What was he doing in this Time Zone?
00:22:41.902,00:22:46.615,What I was thinking was he might have brought this on himself.
00:22:46.615,00:22:49.409,"Interesting. How long you been keeping time, Jaeger?"
00:22:49.409,00:22:51.287,Five years.
00:22:51.287,00:22:54.414,Let me know what you think when you have been doing it for 50.
00:22:54.414,00:22:56.209,It doesn't matter why he came here.
00:22:56.209,00:23:00.420,What matters are the hundred years that came with him.
00:23:02.298,00:23:04.175,Gotta be a witness.
00:23:04.175,00:23:06.010,"Trust me, no one saw anything."
00:23:06.010,00:23:07.761,"What would you like us to do, sir?"
00:23:08.971,00:23:12.141,What we always do.
00:23:15.561,00:23:18.814,"Hey, Ray. I'll give you 10 minutes for an hour."
00:23:18.814,00:23:20.858,"When are you gonna get out of the game, Leila?"
00:23:20.858,00:23:22.068,You gotta be pushing 60.
00:23:22.068,00:23:24.111,Thanks for letting everyone know.
00:23:35.122,00:23:36.498,Am I in the right place?
00:23:59.897,00:24:04.442,We don't normally make pickups in this Zone.
00:24:04.442,00:24:06.612,I was lost.
00:24:12.576,00:24:15.704,COMPUTER VOICE: Please deposit one month.
00:24:38.852,00:24:42.231,Please deposit two months.
00:24:50.072,00:24:52.574,There are more of these than I remember.
00:25:03.961,00:25:06.130,That was a year.
00:25:06.130,00:25:08.506,Welcome to New Greenwich.
00:25:10.217,00:25:14.430,What are you really doing here?
00:25:14.430,00:25:17.183,I'm going to take them for everything they've got.
00:25:21.437,00:25:23.563,I'm going to make them pay.
00:26:25.834,00:26:28.586,"Please, miss."
00:26:28.586,00:26:30.588,Are you sure?
00:26:32.590,00:26:34.676,What's a night here cost?
00:26:34.676,00:26:36.887,Two months for a standard room.
00:26:40.391,00:26:41.725,Give me a suite.
00:26:52.778,00:26:54.988,Do you need help with your bags?
00:26:54.988,00:26:56.698,No.
00:27:07.625,00:27:10.254,He's fast.
00:27:10.254,00:27:13.799,The camera doesn't show us how the body got into the river.
00:27:13.799,00:27:15.842,What do we really know?
00:27:15.842,00:27:17.761,What do we know?
00:27:17.761,00:27:21.890,We know that most thefts in Dayton amount to hours or days.
00:27:21.890,00:27:24.935,This was a century.
00:27:24.935,00:27:27.854,I don't see any more in circulation.
00:27:27.854,00:27:29.398,He could have capsuled the time.
00:27:29.398,00:27:32.109,You can't hide a hundred years in the ghetto.
00:27:32.109,00:27:35.737,They can sense when a man has a month more than he should.
00:27:37.823,00:27:39.825,The time left town.
00:28:24.828,00:28:27.456,That'll be eight and a half weeks.
00:28:28.706,00:28:31.168,Take a week for yourself.
00:28:31.168,00:28:33.337,Thanks.
00:28:37.424,00:28:42.971,"You're not from around here, are you?"
00:28:42.971,00:28:46.058,You do everything a little too fast.
00:28:46.058,00:28:48.268,Not everything.
00:28:49.978,00:28:52.356,What's that place across the street?
00:28:52.356,00:28:53.899,The casino.
00:28:53.899,00:28:55.817,Can anybody go?
00:28:56.985,00:28:58.362,Not dressed like that.
00:28:59.530,00:29:01.198,Good luck.
00:29:07.580,00:29:09.498,"Sir, you were right."
00:29:09.498,00:29:20.800,"If you turn back the clocks the day of Hamilton's death, and look at the time checks, someone spent years crossing four different Time Zones from Dayton-- To New Greenwich."
00:29:20.800,00:29:26.390,"He's conscious of the surveillance, he doesn't have a bodyguard, and he runs."
00:29:26.390,00:29:28.850,"But if he has time, he doesn't need to run."
00:29:28.850,00:29:30.977,It's a hard habit to break.
00:29:32.438,00:29:34.940,You're looking for a match?
00:29:34.940,00:29:37.568,His name is Will Salas.
00:29:37.568,00:29:39.737,You know him?
00:29:39.737,00:29:41.238,No.
00:29:42.406,00:29:44.032,I remember his father.
00:29:51.624,00:29:55.085,Good evening.
00:29:55.085,00:29:57.546,I assume my time is as good as anyone's.
00:29:57.546,00:30:04.678,"Indeed it is. However, there is a voluntary donation for non-members."
00:30:12.352,00:30:13.895,What's your game?
00:30:13.895,00:30:15.147,Poker.
00:30:15.147,00:30:16.523,Right this way.
00:30:18.651,00:30:20.944,What's the limit?
00:30:20.944,00:30:22.571,There is none.
00:30:36.042,00:30:39.171,"I don't believe we've had the pleasure of your company before, Mr..."
00:30:39.171,00:30:40.964,Salas.
00:30:40.964,00:30:42.675,Will Salas.
00:30:42.675,00:30:46.637,Philippe Weis.
00:30:49.055,00:30:51.642,You could say I'm gambling my inheritance.
00:30:51.642,00:30:54.394,"You don't have a guard, Mr. Salas?"
00:30:57.314,00:30:59.733,I assumed I was amongst friends.
00:31:06.365,00:31:07.991,Bet you 50 years.
00:31:16.041,00:31:18.418,You must be young.
00:31:18.418,00:31:28.178,"When you've been 25 for 85 years, like I have, knowing only a random act of violence can take your life, you learn to appreciate what you have."
00:31:28.178,00:31:30.430,And you seem to have a lot to appreciate.
00:31:33.141,00:31:35.143,I call.
00:31:51.243,00:31:56.331,"Of course, some think what we have is unfair."
00:31:56.331,00:31:58.041,The time difference between Zones.
00:31:58.041,00:32:00.586,I've heard that.
00:32:00.586,00:32:03.338,But isn't this just the next logical step in our evolution?
00:32:03.338,00:32:06.258,And hasn't evolution always been unfair?
00:32:06.258,00:32:10.053,It's always been survival of the fittest.
00:32:10.053,00:32:12.806,Raise you another two centuries.
00:32:15.809,00:32:18.854,This is merely Darwinian capitalism.
00:32:20.188,00:32:21.690,Natural selection.
00:32:21.690,00:32:24.192,Absolutely.
00:32:24.192,00:32:26.945,The strong survive.
00:32:26.945,00:32:29.197,And I think your hand is weak.
00:32:30.323,00:32:32.117,I call.
00:32:47.048,00:32:50.302,"It appears you're all in, Mr. Salas."
00:33:19.498,00:33:21.750,Thirteen figures.
00:33:22.918,00:33:25.211,Well played.
00:33:25.211,00:33:28.006,That was some risk.
00:33:32.511,00:33:33.887,It wasn't a risk.
00:33:33.887,00:33:37.432,No offense. I knew I was going to win.
00:33:39.392,00:33:41.102,Confusing times.
00:33:42.521,00:33:45.106,"Is she my mother, my sister or my daughter?"
00:33:45.106,00:33:47.192,You're hoping she's not my wife.
00:33:47.192,00:33:51.989,Things used to be simpler once.
00:33:53.365,00:33:54.867,Very beautiful.
00:33:56.117,00:33:57.703,Daughter.
00:33:57.703,00:34:01.790,Though she does look a lot like my wife.
00:34:01.790,00:34:03.166,Will Salas.
00:34:03.166,00:34:05.585,"Congratulations, Mr. Salas."
00:34:07.045,00:34:09.130,You've taken years off my father's life.
00:34:09.130,00:34:13.719,Which is normally what you do.
00:34:13.719,00:34:16.722,We're having a party tomorrow night.
00:34:16.722,00:34:20.308,Perhaps you'll give him a chance to win back some of those years.
00:34:21.434,00:34:22.978,I'd love to.
00:34:22.978,00:34:24.396,Carl will tell you where I am.
00:34:24.396,00:34:25.814,"Good night, Mr. Salas."
00:34:25.814,00:34:28.734,"Sylvia, stay with your guards."
00:34:42.080,00:34:45.042,Fifty-nine years.
00:34:45.042,00:34:46.376,Plus tax.
00:34:57.888,00:34:59.389,The price includes delivery.
00:34:59.389,00:35:01.307,Delivery?
00:35:01.307,00:35:04.019,To wherever you're going to display it.
00:35:05.353,00:35:06.730,Display it?
00:35:06.730,00:35:08.941,"Hell, I'm going to drive it."
00:35:28.668,00:35:31.254,Will Salas.
00:35:31.254,00:35:38.095,"Allow me to introduce my mother-in-law, Clara, my wife, Michele, and my daughter, Sylvia."
00:35:38.095,00:35:40.179,I believe you two have already met.
00:35:41.347,00:35:43.892,Nice to meet you all.
00:35:43.892,00:35:47.270,PHILIPPE: I'll come find you later for our game.
00:35:47.270,00:35:50.023,I look forward to it.
00:36:04.579,00:36:07.248,"Having fun, Mr. Salas?"
00:36:09.208,00:36:11.628,"Please, call me Will."
00:36:11.628,00:36:13.672,"It's okay, Constantin."
00:36:16.257,00:36:19.552,Do you always have a hired hand standing right next to you?
00:36:19.552,00:36:22.681,No. I usually have two.
00:36:22.681,00:36:25.725,That doesn't make it very easy to get to know you.
00:36:25.725,00:36:28.770,I think that's the idea.
00:36:28.770,00:36:30.480,My father's.
00:36:30.480,00:36:32.607,I understand.
00:36:32.607,00:36:35.318,You all have a lot to lose.
00:36:35.318,00:36:37.320,So do you.
00:36:39.823,00:36:42.159,"What do you do, Will?"
00:36:42.159,00:36:45.078,I haven't quite figured that out yet.
00:36:45.078,00:36:49.833,"Yes, why bother?"
00:36:49.833,00:36:53.962,Right. Why do today what you can do in a century?
00:36:53.962,00:36:55.714,I know one thing we can do.
00:36:58.591,00:37:00.343,Dance with me.
00:37:06.683,00:37:09.686,Do you really come from time?
00:37:09.686,00:37:11.938,Why would you doubt that?
00:37:14.149,00:37:16.776,I saw you run.
00:37:16.776,00:37:19.529,Reminds me of people who come from the ghetto.
00:37:22.115,00:37:24.951,Sometimes I envy them.
00:37:27.162,00:37:30.498,You don't know anything.
00:37:30.498,00:37:34.377,"Oh, no? The clock is good for no one."
00:37:36.337,00:37:39.174,The poor die and the rich don't live.
00:37:39.174,00:37:43.595,We can all live forever as long as we don't do anything foolish.
00:37:43.595,00:37:48.433,Doesn't that scare you?
00:37:48.433,00:37:52.896,Or courageous or anything worth a damn?
00:37:57.943,00:37:59.652,Come with me.
00:38:14.167,00:38:16.253,This was tonight.
00:38:18.671,00:38:21.007,He's only an hour ahead of us.
00:38:28.056,00:38:30.642,Look at that.
00:38:30.642,00:38:33.519,I've never seen anything like it.
00:38:35.855,00:38:37.523,What are you doing?
00:38:39.067,00:38:40.652,We don't go in.
00:38:42.988,00:38:45.031,You're insane.
00:38:45.031,00:38:48.618,You have this in your backyard.
00:38:49.786,00:38:51.412,And I'm insane?
00:38:56.251,00:38:59.587,Well? What are you waiting for?
00:39:00.839,00:39:03.382,"Sylvia, come on!"
00:39:03.382,00:39:06.886,What happened to doing something foolish?
00:39:27.740,00:39:29.659,I don't know you.
00:39:31.452,00:39:33.246,We could change that.
00:39:35.832,00:39:38.376,I get it.
00:39:38.376,00:39:43.589,"You're out here, all alone, with a stranger."
00:39:44.841,00:39:47.719,You can't be too careful.
00:39:47.719,00:39:50.388,Maybe you can.
00:39:50.388,00:39:52.265,Sylvia!
00:39:53.850,00:39:55.601,Sylvia!
00:40:05.195,00:40:08.073,I have to go back.
00:40:08.073,00:40:09.991,To what?
00:40:15.496,00:40:17.665,You should go back.
00:40:29.010,00:40:31.971,Have you seen my daughter?
00:40:33.265,00:40:35.975,She's with her guards.
00:40:35.975,00:40:37.727,Right behind you.
00:40:40.188,00:40:42.148,Thank God.
00:40:42.148,00:40:46.361,"Now, how about that game?"
00:40:54.202,00:40:57.163,"It's all right, everyone."
00:40:58.706,00:41:02.419,"I'm sorry to have to break up the party, Mr. Weis."
00:41:02.419,00:41:04.503,I just need a word with your friend.
00:41:05.797,00:41:08.300,My friend?
00:41:09.301,00:41:10.802,Very well.
00:41:37.662,00:41:40.123,I'm Timekeeper Raymond Leon.
00:41:43.835,00:41:45.128,I'm Will Salas.
00:41:45.128,00:41:46.587,I know.
00:41:50.049,00:41:52.218,What are you doing in this Zone?
00:41:52.218,00:41:55.054,"It's not illegal, is it?"
00:41:55.054,00:41:58.475,"No, it's not illegal."
00:41:58.475,00:42:00.935,It's just rare.
00:42:05.523,00:42:07.066,Where did you get that?
00:42:07.066,00:42:09.235,I won it.
00:42:09.235,00:42:11.363,Gambling.
00:42:14.157,00:42:15.450,All of it?
00:42:20.538,00:42:22.790,No.
00:42:22.790,00:42:25.626,A man named Henry Hamilton gave me over a century.
00:42:28.838,00:42:30.965,He said he didn't need it anymore.
00:42:32.425,00:42:34.177,He timed himself out.
00:42:34.177,00:42:38.014,Henry Hamilton was worth thousands of years.
00:42:38.014,00:42:41.726,He could practically live forever.
00:42:41.726,00:42:47.190,You expect me to believe that he was immortal and he wanted to die?
00:42:47.190,00:42:50.943,I don't expect you to believe it.
00:42:50.943,00:42:52.570,But it's the truth.
00:42:54.531,00:42:56.699,It was a gift.
00:42:56.699,00:42:58.076,I'm not a thief.
00:42:59.660,00:43:06.251,"But, hey, if you guys are looking for stolen time, maybe you should arrest everyone here."
00:43:06.251,00:43:07.544,"Oh, I see."
00:43:07.544,00:43:10.129,You're talking about justice.
00:43:11.839,00:43:14.259,"Well, I am a Timekeeper."
00:43:14.259,00:43:17.470,I don't concern myself with justice.
00:43:17.470,00:43:21.140,I only concern myself with what I can measure.
00:43:21.140,00:43:23.768,"Seconds, minutes, hours."
00:43:26.145,00:43:28.565,I keep time.
00:43:28.565,00:43:31.692,And that time is in the wrong hands.
00:43:33.986,00:43:37.698,"That time will be held, along with you."
00:43:40.659,00:43:44.163,We'll leave you two hours for booking and processing.
00:43:46.999,00:43:51.003,Why are you investigating a suicide?
00:43:51.003,00:43:53.465,There's mass murder in the ghetto every day.
00:44:00.346,00:44:02.140,That is fascinating.
00:44:03.475,00:44:05.726,Huh.
00:44:05.726,00:44:08.480,I heard another man talk like that.
00:44:09.522,00:44:12.024,It was over 20 years ago.
00:44:14.569,00:44:18.156,You were probably too young to remember your father.
00:44:18.156,00:44:20.950,We'll arrange safe transport.
00:44:20.950,00:44:24.036,"This is New Greenwich, after all."
00:44:27.790,00:44:31.294,Sylvia? Do as I say and go with the guards.
00:44:31.294,00:44:34.005,"Oh, for God's sake, Father."
00:44:34.005,00:44:39.051,"If we can't stop one man from killing us, we should kill ourselves."
00:45:00.573,00:45:02.367,Stop him!
00:45:04.536,00:45:07.330,Move! Get out of the way!
00:45:11.626,00:45:14.462,Put it down or I'll blow her head off.
00:45:15.588,00:45:17.382,Thanks.
00:45:56.045,00:45:59.173,You're going to kill us!
00:46:24.616,00:46:27.201,What are you doing?
00:46:28.202,00:46:29.995,Do you even know how to drive?
00:46:29.995,00:46:32.540,What's there to know?
00:46:46.178,00:46:48.973,"Oh, shit."
00:47:24.008,00:47:25.842,Give me some time.
00:47:27.928,00:47:30.055,"I guess you really are from the ghetto, after all."
00:47:30.055,00:47:33.768,What the hell do you know about where I'm from?
00:47:33.768,00:47:36.646,"Or you're gonna kill me, like you killed Henry Hamilton?"
00:47:36.646,00:47:38.314,Lend me an hour.
00:47:38.314,00:47:42.276,I'm not giving you a second.
00:47:42.276,00:47:44.153,I should have listened to my father.
00:47:45.904,00:47:49.325,"Please, take me home."
00:47:49.325,00:47:51.076,I can't do that.
00:47:51.076,00:47:52.745,You're keeping me alive.
00:47:54.580,00:47:56.833,Keep that covered.
00:47:56.833,00:47:59.585,"Anybody sees it, you're definitely dead."
00:48:33.244,00:48:35.246,Now that worked too well.
00:48:35.246,00:48:37.874,You guys wasted a gorgeous car.
00:48:37.874,00:48:39.542,Look who it is.
00:48:39.542,00:48:41.460,Who it was.
00:48:44.338,00:48:45.882,He's done in minutes.
00:48:45.882,00:48:49.510,He'll wake up dead.
00:48:49.510,00:48:52.889,Too bad.
00:48:52.889,00:48:54.931,The girl's still breathing.
00:48:54.931,00:48:56.642,She's got a decade.
00:48:57.810,00:48:59.311,Holy shit.
00:48:59.311,00:49:02.314,The man he stole from me had more than a century.
00:49:06.110,00:49:09.280,What? We'll divide it later.
00:49:09.280,00:49:11.657,It's like an angel fell from the sky.
00:49:13.117,00:49:16.078,Hey.
00:49:16.078,00:49:17.872,Fortis!
00:49:17.872,00:49:19.290,Leave it!
00:49:19.290,00:49:21.500,Fortis!
00:49:46.943,00:49:48.569,Look at me.
00:49:48.569,00:49:50.404,You okay?
00:49:50.404,00:49:52.156,No.
00:49:53.574,00:49:55.326,Why are you laughing?
00:49:56.327,00:49:57.703,We're not dead.
00:49:57.703,00:49:59.413,"Yeah, we're not alive for long, either."
00:49:59.413,00:50:02.875,Where did my time go?
00:50:02.875,00:50:04.126,Ah.
00:50:04.126,00:50:06.337,You're lucky.
00:50:06.337,00:50:08.840,Minutemen.
00:50:08.840,00:50:11.216,"That's rich, coming from you."
00:50:11.216,00:50:13.093,"Please help me, Will."
00:50:11.216,00:50:15.471,"Let me guess, now you like the idea of sharing."
00:50:16.848,00:50:18.850,Come here.
00:50:20.935,00:50:24.062,"Hey, don't worry."
00:50:24.062,00:50:26.691,"Well, it's a first for me."
00:50:26.691,00:50:29.151,What are we going to do?
00:50:29.151,00:50:32.446,Whatever we have to.
00:50:52.048,00:50:54.635,"Dispatch, wire me my per diem."
00:50:54.635,00:50:56.971,COMPUTER VOICE: Time transfer.
00:51:01.141,00:51:03.561,"Cutting it close again, sir."
00:51:03.561,00:51:06.564,"Well, I'm still walking around."
00:51:06.564,00:51:10.818,"Judging by the lack of dead bodies, I have to assume they are also."
00:51:14.780,00:51:18.659,They got jacked.
00:51:18.659,00:51:22.204,He's back in his old neighborhood.
00:51:22.204,00:51:24.832,"So, where do you want us to start looking?"
00:51:26.082,00:51:29.879,We don't.
00:51:50.066,00:51:51.692,Borel?
00:51:54.528,00:51:56.781,"Borel, open up."
00:51:58.699,00:52:00.158,Greta.
00:52:01.410,00:52:02.995,Where's Borel?
00:52:02.995,00:52:05.664,He's dead.
00:52:05.664,00:52:09.125,Dead? What?
00:52:09.125,00:52:11.462,You gave him a decade.
00:52:11.462,00:52:14.673,He drank himself to death with nine years on his clock.
00:52:14.673,00:52:16.092,Jesus Christ.
00:52:18.719,00:52:20.345,"Greta, I'm so sorry."
00:52:21.597,00:52:24.058,"Goodbye, Will."
00:52:30.773,00:52:33.317,"Will, we have minutes."
00:52:33.317,00:52:35.151,What is that supposed to mean?
00:52:35.151,00:52:37.113,"We're going to die, Will!"
00:52:37.113,00:52:39.155,Shut up!
00:52:43.995,00:52:47.581,I hope those are real. Run.
00:52:57.925,00:52:59.551,Stop! Wait!
00:52:59.551,00:53:01.720,"Please, wait!"

00:53:24.160,00:53:25.703,I'll give you two days for them.
00:53:25.703,00:53:27.371,They're diamonds.
00:53:27.371,00:53:29.748,"You can take the 48 hours, or you can be a pretty corpse."
00:53:29.748,00:53:31.583,We'll take it.
00:53:42.344,00:53:43.804,Don't make a sound.
00:53:43.804,00:53:45.890,Give me my time.
00:53:52.228,00:53:54.815,Let's go.
00:53:54.815,00:53:57.068,I guess I got my wish.
00:53:57.068,00:53:59.820,I did do something foolish.
00:54:01.530,00:54:03.490,Your name's on a lot of buildings.
00:54:03.490,00:54:05.241,It's my father's name.
00:54:05.241,00:54:08.453,"How much is he worth, anyway?"
00:54:08.453,00:54:10.414,Eons.
00:54:10.414,00:54:12.624,What do you think he'd pay to get you back?
00:54:12.624,00:54:15.211,"You have no shame, do you?"
00:54:18.756,00:54:22.176,COMPUTER VOICE: Please deposit one minute.
00:54:23.301,00:54:24.678,Dial.
00:54:38.150,00:54:39.818,Hello.
00:54:39.818,00:54:43.114,"Mr. Weis, please give the phone to the Timekeeper."
00:54:48.493,00:54:51.956,"Hello, Will."
00:54:51.956,00:54:53.791,A thousand years.
00:54:55.042,00:54:57.628,You'll never live to spend it.
00:55:00.296,00:55:04.927,Then distribute it to the Time Lines in Dayton.
00:55:04.927,00:55:07.512,Do it by sunrise tomorrow and she can go home.
00:55:10.015,00:55:11.475,Will...
00:55:12.768,00:55:15.062,"I'm afraid for you, Will."
00:55:15.062,00:55:18.190,"You keep talking like him, you're going to die like him."
00:55:18.190,00:55:21.944,"My father died in a fight, trying to take a man's time."
00:55:21.944,00:55:26.364,"Oh, no. His crime wasn't taking time."
00:55:26.364,00:55:28.784,He was doing something far more dangerous.
00:55:30.202,00:55:32.621,Please don't make your father's mistake.
00:55:38.836,00:55:40.754,Dayton. Pedre Plaza.
00:55:40.754,00:55:43.132,I know it.
00:55:43.132,00:55:46.510,A thousand years to the Time Lines.
00:55:46.510,00:55:48.179,A thousand years.
00:55:50.514,00:55:52.224,It's nothing.
00:55:52.224,00:55:54.310,It's for our daughter.
00:55:55.727,00:55:58.063,"No, it's for them."
00:55:58.063,00:56:00.107,This is insane.
00:56:00.107,00:56:03.359,"They can take your time, just like that."
00:56:03.359,00:56:05.487,Or you can take theirs.
00:56:05.487,00:56:07.739,This is insane.
00:56:07.739,00:56:10.326,"Yeah, it's insane."
00:56:23.922,00:56:27.259,We should be safe here until dawn.
00:56:27.259,00:56:30.428,I pay by the day.
00:56:35.684,00:56:37.228,This is your place?
00:56:40.147,00:56:43.859,"There's water. It's cold, but it's something."
00:56:44.860,00:56:47.112,You can put on fresh clothes.
00:57:18.018,00:57:19.603,Where's your family?
00:57:21.397,00:57:23.899,My mother timed out.
00:57:26.235,00:57:27.652,This is her dress.
00:57:27.652,00:57:29.571,Yeah.
00:57:32.408,00:57:34.159,What about your father?
00:57:35.411,00:57:37.871,He died when I was a boy.
00:57:37.871,00:57:40.540,He was a fighter.
00:57:42.251,00:57:46.755,"He wasn't the strongest, but he knew how to win."
00:57:46.755,00:57:49.258,How do you win?
00:57:57.266,00:57:59.393,I'll show you.
00:58:02.562,00:58:07.276,What you do is let them have the upper hand.
00:58:07.276,00:58:10.946,"Then, he'd let his time go all the way down."
00:58:12.072,00:58:27.879,"Because he knew that when you were down to your last seconds and they think it's over, they start watching your clock and forget to watch their own."
00:58:43.937,00:58:46.482,He died in a fight?
00:58:48.817,00:58:53.197,I think he was killed for giving away what he won.
00:58:53.197,00:58:56.241,He wasn't just giving them time.
00:58:56.241,00:58:57.909,He was giving them hope.
00:59:02.831,00:59:04.624,How long have you been this old?
00:59:04.624,00:59:06.751,Twenty-five for three.
00:59:08.545,00:59:10.588,Twenty-five for two.
00:59:13.050,00:59:15.302,What was it like when your clock started?
00:59:18.763,00:59:20.015,I was in the street.
00:59:20.015,00:59:22.559,It almost knocked me over.
00:59:22.559,00:59:25.687,"My year was gone in a week, we were so in debt."
00:59:25.687,00:59:29.149,"After that, I lived day to day."
00:59:30.692,00:59:33.111,Mine was a little different.
00:59:34.279,00:59:36.281,It woke me.
00:59:48.544,00:59:51.380,I looked in the mirror.
00:59:51.380,00:59:55.300,I guess everybody does.
00:59:55.300,00:59:58.554,That's what you're gonna look like for the rest of your life.
00:59:59.721,01:00:02.182,My dad gave me a decade to celebrate.
01:00:04.268,01:00:05.643,You must hate me.
01:00:07.354,01:00:09.981,Where I come from.
01:00:09.981,01:00:13.569,"It's nobody's fault, what they're born with."
01:00:33.547,01:00:37.134,They open in a minute.
01:00:37.134,01:00:39.553,Let's see how generous your father is now.
01:01:09.916,01:01:11.960,The Timekeepers would have never let him do it.
01:01:11.960,01:01:14.796,You don't have to say that.
01:01:14.796,01:01:18.175,How do you think my father built all those buildings?
01:01:18.175,01:01:20.677,By giving away a thousand years?
01:01:24.556,01:01:26.683,Now what?
01:01:27.892,01:01:29.645,You can go home.
01:01:31.271,01:01:33.106,There's people on the streets.
01:01:33.106,01:01:35.567,I can move without being spotted.
01:01:35.567,01:01:36.901,What have you got?
01:01:39.404,01:01:41.156,Eleven hours.
01:01:42.866,01:01:44.868,How does anyone live like this?
01:01:44.868,01:01:46.744,You don't generally sleep in.
01:01:54.378,01:01:56.630,You can call for help.
01:01:56.630,01:01:58.715,"I'll watch from here, I'll make sure you're safe."
01:01:58.715,01:02:01.259,"You know, you could fight this."
01:02:01.259,01:02:04.388,I can say that running to the ghetto was my idea.
01:02:04.388,01:02:07.724,"My father'd believe that, he thinks I'm reckless."
01:02:07.724,01:02:09.267,"He has a lot of influence, Will."
01:02:09.267,01:02:11.311,He can get you a lawyer.
01:02:11.311,01:02:13.438,He can make a deal with those Timekeepers.
01:02:13.438,01:02:17.150,I'm pretty sure that Timekeeper doesn't make deals.
01:02:19.027,01:02:21.154,What are you going to do?
01:02:21.154,01:02:22.906,Steal?
01:02:24.575,01:02:27.118,Is it stealing if it's already stolen?
01:02:29.746,01:02:32.332,Here. Just in case.
01:02:33.709,01:02:35.960,I'll be right here.

01:03:17.961,01:03:19.546,I wish I could say I'm surprised.
01:03:24.593,01:03:26.261,Did you hear what I just said?
01:03:26.261,01:03:29.139,You know I'd do anything for you.

01:03:52.162,01:03:55.624,"Sorry to disappoint you, we don't keep much on us."
01:03:55.624,01:03:58.418,To discourage thieves like you.
01:04:03.590,01:04:04.924,Think of this as a gift.
01:04:06.843,01:04:08.219,Will! Come on!
01:04:30.367,01:04:32.619,I didn't mean to shoot him.
01:04:32.619,01:04:35.038,I think you did both.
01:04:35.038,01:04:36.373,You could say thank you.
01:04:36.373,01:04:39.250,Thank you.
01:04:39.250,01:04:42.128,Nine hours.
01:04:42.128,01:04:45.465,Why did you give him time?
01:04:47.175,01:04:49.594,Timekeepers live day to day.
01:04:50.970,01:04:53.640,It'll be hours before the others show up.
01:04:53.640,01:04:56.226,He could die in the ghetto.
01:04:56.226,01:04:57.977,He still might.
01:04:57.977,01:05:00.731,"Timekeeper, what's the hurry?"
01:05:00.731,01:05:04.526,Stay a while.
01:05:07.779,01:05:09.740,They're going to think you're with me.
01:05:09.740,01:05:11.408,Yes.
01:05:13.326,01:05:15.203,This is a mess.
01:05:15.203,01:05:17.121,Welcome to my world.
01:05:20.667,01:05:22.419,Back off!
01:05:24.003,01:05:27.048,You've been shot.
01:05:28.299,01:05:30.510,Where'd you get that?
01:05:42.021,01:05:43.857,What are we going to do?
01:05:43.857,01:05:46.234,We can't keep driving around in this car.
01:05:46.234,01:05:48.779,It's a cop car.
01:05:48.779,01:05:50.947,So let's make an arrest.
01:06:10.341,01:06:12.051,Was I going too fast?
01:06:12.051,01:06:15.597,Not fast enough.
01:06:15.597,01:06:18.600,The mistake you made was stopping.
01:06:18.600,01:06:22.019,"Now, let's see who you got back there."
01:06:23.396,01:06:27.317,Got to be a year or two nobody's using.
01:06:27.317,01:06:29.152,Whoa!
01:06:30.821,01:06:33.197,It went off.
01:06:33.197,01:06:34.950,I was just trying to help.
01:06:41.623,01:06:44.751,Come on.
01:06:44.751,01:06:49.840,"Now, I'd say, Your money or your life, but since your money is your life..."
01:06:49.840,01:06:51.758,How dare you steal from me?
01:06:51.758,01:06:53.384,Don't think of it as stealing.
01:06:53.384,01:06:55.512,Think of it as repossession.
01:06:55.512,01:06:58.097,I'll leave you with what I've had most every day of my life.
01:06:58.097,01:07:01.392,One day.
01:07:01.392,01:07:02.644,Are you insane?
01:07:02.644,01:07:04.729,You can do a lot in a day.
01:07:07.858,01:07:09.442,Those are pretty.
01:07:15.866,01:07:17.158,I owe you these.
01:07:17.158,01:07:19.369,You shouldn't have.
01:07:19.369,01:07:20.829,"You, out."
01:07:27.002,01:07:35.802,"FEMALE ANCHOR: Will Salas, prime suspect in the murder of Henry Hamilton, is believed to be traveling with Sylvia Weis, daughter of finance magnate, Philippe Weis."

01:07:41.766,01:07:43.768,We look cute together.
01:07:47.438,01:07:49.524,It doesn't say you're wanted.
01:07:51.026,01:07:54.029,It doesn't say I'm not.
01:07:54.029,01:07:57.407,You've forgotten I shot a cop.
01:07:57.407,01:08:00.326,"I admit, not very well."
01:08:00.326,01:08:02.286,It was your first time.
01:08:04.581,01:08:06.082,Hey.
01:08:06.082,01:08:09.627,I can say I made you do all of it.
01:08:09.627,01:08:11.629,You can go back.
01:08:11.629,01:08:14.925,Go back to what?
01:08:14.925,01:08:19.136,Do I really want to spend my whole life trying not to die by mistake?
01:08:21.598,01:08:24.517,A lot of people would say being here is a mistake.
01:08:26.895,01:08:28.897,I don't have a choice.
01:08:31.524,01:08:34.069,"I'm starting to think that I don't, either."
01:08:54.839,01:08:58.426,I want to reassure you all there is no cause for alarm.
01:08:58.426,01:08:59.928,No ransom was paid.

01:09:10.063,01:09:11.856,GUARD: Sir.
01:09:14.191,01:09:17.946,Everything is under control.
01:09:24.410,01:09:29.916,"Timekeeper. After this regrettable incident, it's really not necessary for you to come in person."
01:09:29.916,01:09:34.378,I'm afraid it really is necessary.
01:09:37.423,01:09:39.009,When can we hope for a rescue?
01:09:39.009,01:09:40.927,I believe that's the point.
01:09:40.927,01:09:43.138,She doesn't appear to want to be rescued.
01:09:44.597,01:09:46.390,Mr. Leon.
01:09:47.475,01:09:50.603,Raymond. May I call you Raymond?
01:09:52.522,01:09:55.150,I blame myself.
01:09:55.150,01:09:57.360,I invited the man into my home.
01:09:57.360,01:10:01.031,"He had so much time, how was I supposed to know?"
01:10:01.031,01:10:06.077,"Of course, Sylvia brought this on herself by her lack of vigilance."
01:10:06.077,01:10:09.539,That's why I always tried to keep her close.
01:10:09.539,01:10:13.793,But she is clearly under Will Salas' control.
01:10:21.592,01:10:28.224,"If it's a matter of resources, I'm happy to make a contribution."
01:10:28.224,01:10:30.810,"It's a scandal, what we pay our Timekeepers."
01:10:34.313,01:10:37.150,I've issued a warrant for your daughter's arrest.
01:10:37.150,01:10:41.946,"If she contacts you and you assist her in any way, I will issue a warrant for your arrest."
01:10:52.832,01:10:55.543,There is nothing I cannot buy.
01:10:57.503,01:11:02.508,Now how many of my years do you want?
01:11:04.343,01:11:11.851,"There aren't enough years, even in your lifetime, Mr. Weis. Good night."
01:11:16.773,01:11:19.776,This is called a trigger.
01:11:19.776,01:11:23.196,And you don't pull it until you actually want to shoot something.
01:11:30.078,01:11:31.454,I wanted to shoot something.
01:11:31.454,01:11:33.164,Right.
01:11:36.793,01:11:43.674,"Will, if you get a lot of time, are you really gonna give it away?"
01:11:43.674,01:11:45.802,I've only ever had a day.
01:11:45.802,01:11:49.222,How much do you need?
01:11:49.222,01:11:53.559,How can you live with yourself watching people die right next to you?
01:11:53.559,01:11:56.646,You don't watch.
01:11:56.646,01:11:58.773,You close your eyes.
01:12:07.698,01:12:10.409,I can help you get all the time you want.
01:12:17.000,01:12:20.461,I need to borrow a month.
01:12:20.461,01:12:23.923,"Today's rate, 30%."
01:12:23.923,01:12:25.842,I can't pay it back.
01:12:25.842,01:12:27.927,We can always come to some arrangement.
01:12:53.870,01:12:55.330,Let's go.
01:12:57.373,01:13:04.214,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to announce that Weis Timelenders is now offering interest-free loans with no payments."
01:13:04.214,01:13:05.422,Ever.
01:13:05.422,01:13:07.175,So help yourselves and take a day.
01:13:07.175,01:13:08.634,"Take a month. Hell, take a year."
01:13:08.634,01:13:10.970,Come on.
01:13:10.970,01:13:12.555,Take the time.
01:13:47.673,01:13:50.551,"No one's watching their clocks, huh?"
01:13:50.551,01:13:53.888,"Get out of here, or I'll confiscate every second!"
01:14:00.186,01:14:02.438,Must've thought it was a drive-through.
01:14:35.096,01:14:36.513,Turn around.
01:14:36.513,01:14:37.765,Don't move.
01:14:37.765,01:14:39.350,I don't have much.
01:14:39.350,01:14:40.893,"Everything I have, I give away."
01:14:40.893,01:14:42.228,I know.
01:15:03.416,01:15:07.503,"Yes, sir, I do know that, sir."
01:15:07.503,01:15:10.089,There are years that shouldn't be there.
01:15:13.801,01:15:16.095,"I will stop him, sir."
01:15:17.847,01:15:22.518,Doesn't he understand he's hurting the very people he's trying to help?
01:15:31.152,01:15:33.612,"Well, now."
01:15:33.612,01:15:35.614,Look at all that.
01:15:35.614,01:15:38.326,I finally had time to buy one of these.
01:15:40.577,01:15:42.746,Let's not do anything I might regret.
01:16:15.488,01:16:18.032,What was that about?
01:16:18.032,01:16:20.076,I wasted 30 days.
01:16:20.076,01:16:29.793,"FEMALE ANCHOR: Today, Sylvia Weis withdrew some of her inheritance when she and Will Salas robbed her father's time bank for the sixth time in a week."
01:16:29.793,01:16:32.547,I give her everything.
01:16:32.547,01:16:34.382,Does she want to kill me?
01:16:34.382,01:16:36.426,"You were killing her, Philippe."
01:16:38.469,01:16:40.471,You were suffocating her.
01:16:42.473,01:16:44.308,You suffocate us all.
01:16:48.604,01:16:50.606,Call.
01:16:55.319,01:16:57.696,That's good.
01:16:57.696,01:17:00.741,Just not as good as that.
01:17:00.741,01:17:02.826,Ooh!
01:17:02.826,01:17:04.954,You haven't forgotten how to play cards.
01:17:04.954,01:17:08.541,Why did I play strip poker with you?
01:17:08.541,01:17:10.293,Why did you?
01:17:16.132,01:17:17.800,Sir.
01:17:17.800,01:17:20.719,They're still there.
01:17:20.719,01:17:23.473,"How did you know, sir?"
01:17:23.473,01:17:26.016,This is where the hours and the days are.
01:17:27.935,01:17:30.896,He's paid them all off.
01:17:30.896,01:17:32.398,This is where I would hide.
01:17:40.114,01:17:41.949,Put your clothes on.
01:17:48.581,01:17:50.541,KORS: Stop!
01:17:51.834,01:17:53.752,We're trapped!
01:17:55.212,01:17:57.131,Jump. They won't do it.
01:17:57.131,01:17:58.757,We shouldn't do it.
01:18:05.055,01:18:06.599,Come on!
01:18:14.524,01:18:17.067,See? They won't jump.
01:18:19.820,01:18:21.113,So much for your theory.
01:18:21.113,01:18:22.490,Shit!
01:18:38.297,01:18:39.965,Here!
01:18:39.965,01:18:41.342,Go!
01:18:44.554,01:18:47.682,Stop! Stop!
01:19:03.989,01:19:06.659,"I'm telling you, he'll give up before we do!"
01:19:06.659,01:19:09.078,You sure about that?
01:19:09.078,01:19:10.787,No.
01:19:28.972,01:19:30.558,Go.
01:19:30.558,01:19:32.976,You can! Go!
01:19:34.311,01:19:35.730,Un-fucking-believable!
01:19:50.160,01:19:52.455,Hold on.
01:19:52.455,01:19:54.624,You two look familiar.
01:19:56.875,01:19:58.711,How about now?
01:20:24.278,01:20:25.946,Welcome to the Century.
01:20:25.946,01:20:29.408,Hi. We're looking for a quiet place to stay.
01:20:29.408,01:20:30.993,How many rooms?
01:20:30.993,01:20:32.662,All of them.
01:20:32.662,01:20:35.038,We were hoping for something long-term.
01:20:35.038,01:20:38.959,Can we rely on the discretion of your staff?
01:20:38.959,01:20:41.962,I'm sure you can.
01:20:49.178,01:20:51.806,I'm sorry.
01:20:53.557,01:20:55.601,Right.
01:21:04.652,01:21:07.029,Nobody goes anywhere!
01:21:07.029,01:21:08.614,"Wait, whoa, whoa."
01:21:09.657,01:21:12.368,MAN: Don't look at me.
01:21:12.368,01:21:14.286,You know who I'm looking for.
01:21:18.207,01:21:24.714,I'm looking for whoever gave this man a month!
01:21:24.714,01:21:33.764,And I'm gonna clean the clocks off of every one of you in this hellhole until someone says something I want to hear.
01:21:41.063,01:21:42.773,I can't hear anything.
01:21:46.861,01:21:48.404,Clean it.
01:21:49.530,01:21:52.366,"No, wait, wait."
01:21:52.366,01:21:56.953,Please don't. Please.
01:21:56.953,01:21:59.582,Please.
01:21:59.582,01:22:02.585,Please!
01:22:02.585,01:22:04.712,Please.
01:22:11.886,01:22:13.846,I believe you're next.
01:22:13.846,01:22:16.432,Um...
01:22:16.432,01:22:20.060,"At last, someone's acting reasonably."
01:22:20.060,01:22:22.730,I just want a share of the reward.
01:22:31.071,01:22:33.323,My young friend.
01:22:34.742,01:22:37.369,You'll get your reward.
01:22:44.167,01:22:46.629,Ten years.
01:22:50.257,01:22:51.967,That's insulting.
01:22:57.890,01:23:04.855,"If they catch us, there's no way they won't kill us, is there?"
01:23:06.690,01:23:09.443,Do you regret this?
01:23:09.443,01:23:11.570,You saved my life.
01:23:13.530,01:23:14.990,When?
01:23:16.575,01:23:18.577,Now.
01:23:18.577,01:23:20.955,And every day since I met you.
01:23:25.208,01:23:28.378,"You forget, I almost got you killed a few times, too."
01:23:30.297,01:23:32.967,I'm willing to overlook that.
01:23:49.065,01:23:51.819,How's the poor little rich girl?
01:23:51.819,01:23:57.324,I never got a chance to properly thank you for your time.
01:23:58.701,01:24:01.077,I'm not surprised you stayed.
01:24:01.077,01:24:04.080,"It's the life, isn't it?"
01:24:04.080,01:24:10.004,Here we don't stop living until we're actually dead.
01:24:11.380,01:24:14.132,There are a lot more ways to die around here.
01:24:14.132,01:24:17.803,"But here, there's dancing before dying."

01:24:32.776,01:24:35.029,Don't you understand?
01:24:35.029,01:24:39.700,The reason the Timekeepers leave me alone is 'cause I have boundaries.
01:24:39.700,01:24:42.285,I steal from my own people.
01:24:42.285,01:24:47.165,You surely know things are bad when I have to restore order.
01:24:49.752,01:24:54.757,"Fortunately for you, I don't like to kill a man in cold blood."
01:24:54.757,01:25:00.971,"I do it, but I prefer not to."
01:25:08.228,01:25:10.856,I think you deserve a fighting chance.
01:25:17.529,01:25:19.406,We play to zero.
01:25:19.406,01:25:22.117,What's the point?
01:25:22.117,01:25:26.997,"I lose, I die."
01:25:26.997,01:25:30.709,"If you don't fight, I'll kill you now."
01:25:30.709,01:25:32.335,And her?
01:25:33.336,01:25:38.133,"After I take you, I'll take her."
01:25:40.677,01:25:44.180,"Oh, yeah."
01:25:44.180,01:25:49.103,Then I'll collect my reward for making everything right in the world.
01:27:10.517,01:27:12.227,This way!
01:27:19.401,01:27:22.029,All the time he's taken.
01:27:22.029,01:27:24.698,"Don't you mean the time he's given away, sir?"
01:27:27.159,01:27:29.327,Even to you?
01:27:36.626,01:27:42.465,I have given 50 years of my life to this job.
01:27:42.465,01:27:45.719,I am not about to see those years go to waste.

01:28:05.155,01:28:12.913,"I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you, but by tomorrow you won't have time to stand around."
01:28:30.931,01:28:33.183,God damn it.
01:28:36.394,01:28:38.272,It's over.
01:28:38.272,01:28:40.398,We lost. We're not doing any good.
01:28:40.398,01:28:42.901,At least we're trying.
01:28:42.901,01:28:47.405,No. You don't understand.
01:28:47.405,01:28:51.534,A hundred years.

01:28:56.039,01:28:58.125,The time we're taking makes no damn difference!
01:28:58.125,01:29:00.294,What would?
01:29:00.294,01:29:04.673,A million years.
01:29:08.510,01:29:11.429,I guess it really would take a million years.

01:30:41.895,01:30:44.480,You'd steal from your own father.
01:30:44.480,01:30:47.150,Is it stealing if it's already stolen?
01:31:01.415,01:31:04.042,What's the combination?
01:31:04.042,01:31:06.086,"Well, it's not my birthday."
01:31:06.086,01:31:10.632,"You've started to regret that day, I imagine, Father."
01:31:10.632,01:31:14.803,Try 12-2-18-09.
01:31:14.803,01:31:16.888,Darwin's birthday.
01:31:18.723,01:31:21.393,Survival of the fittest.
01:31:22.936,01:31:26.731,It cost us centuries just to bribe our way in here.
01:31:26.731,01:31:28.608,Let's see what it got us.
01:31:45.083,01:31:48.670,Quality time.
01:31:48.670,01:31:51.381,There really is a man with a million years.
01:31:51.381,01:31:54.092,That's my first million.
01:31:54.092,01:31:55.551,You know how much good it could do?
01:31:55.551,01:31:57.595,I know how much harm it could do.
01:31:57.595,01:32:02.017,"Try to understand, even if you gave a year to a million people, you're just prolonging their agony."
01:32:02.017,01:32:04.269,You're prolonging their lives.
01:32:04.269,01:32:08.564,"Flooding the wrong Zone with a million years, it could cripple the system."
01:32:08.564,01:32:09.858,Let's hope so.
01:32:09.858,01:32:11.943,We're not meant to live like this.

01:32:14.988,01:32:19.284,"Although I do wonder, Father, if you've ever lived a day in your life."
01:32:19.284,01:32:24.414,Is that so? You might upset the balance for a generation.
01:32:24.414,01:32:26.624,Two.
01:32:26.624,01:32:30.504,But don't fool yourself.
01:32:30.504,01:32:33.923,Because everyone wants to live forever.
01:32:33.923,01:32:40.180,They all think they have a chance at immortality even though all the evidence is against it.
01:32:40.180,01:32:42.349,They all think they will be the exception.
01:32:42.349,01:32:48.104,"But the truth is, for a few to be immortal, many must die."
01:33:03.703,01:33:10.043,No one should be immortal if even one person has to die.
01:33:24.558,01:33:26.809,What was that?
01:33:26.809,01:33:31.147,What was that?
01:33:31.147,01:33:34.608,It must be a mistake.
01:33:34.608,01:33:35.985,It's not a mistake.
01:33:35.985,01:33:37.237,"It's gotta be a mistake, sir."
