00:00:56.765,00:00:59.267,DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER: Antarctica.
00:00:59.309,00:01:02.563,An inhospitable wasteland.
00:01:02.604,00:01:07.943,"But even here, on the Earth's frozen bottom, we find life."
00:01:15.116,00:01:16.994,And not just any life.
00:01:21.498,00:01:23.458,Penguins.
00:01:23.500,00:01:28.839,"Joyous, frolicking, waddling, cute and cuddly life."
00:01:28.881,00:01:34.261,Look at them tumbling onto their chubby bum-bums.
00:01:34.302,00:01:37.180,Who could take these frisky little snow clowns...
00:01:37.222,00:01:38.640,Seriously?
00:01:38.682,00:01:41.184,Does anyone even know where we're marching to?
00:01:41.226,00:01:43.270,Who cares?
00:01:43.311,00:01:45.313,"Me, too."
00:01:45.355,00:01:48.901,We'll just fly to the front of the line and see for ourselves.
00:01:48.943,00:01:51.946,Kowalski! Rico!
00:01:53.655,00:01:55.824,Here we go!
00:01:55.866,00:01:57.868,"Skipper, we appear to be flightless."
00:01:57.910,00:01:59.703,"Aw, well, what's the point of these?"
00:02:04.291,00:02:06.043,Whoa! I like it!
00:02:06.085,00:02:08.045,"Hey, this could be our thing!"
00:02:10.297,00:02:12.716,What are we gonna call it?
00:02:12.758,00:02:14.051,high one.
00:02:14.093,00:02:16.095,Hey! Anybody see that?
00:02:16.136,00:02:17.304,That's an egg!
00:02:17.345,00:02:18.639,Is someone gonna go get it?
00:02:18.680,00:02:19.974,W-We can't do that.
00:02:20.015,00:02:22.726,Why not?
00:02:20.015,00:02:24.979,"Well, it's a dangerous world out there, and we're just penguins."
00:02:25.020,00:02:26.939,"You know, nothing but cute and cuddly."
00:02:26.981,00:02:31.026,Yeah. Why do you think there are always documentary crews filming us?
00:02:33.487,00:02:34.863,"Well, sorry, kid."
00:02:34.905,00:02:36.824,"You know, we lose a few eggs every year."
00:02:36.865,00:02:37.950,It's just nature.
00:02:37.992,00:02:39.701,"Oh, right, nature."
00:02:39.743,00:02:41.954,"I guess that makes sense, but..."
00:02:41.996,00:02:43.664,something...
00:02:43.705,00:02:49.294,something deep down in my gut tells me that it-it makes no sense at all.
00:02:49.336,00:02:50.629,You know what?
00:02:50.671,00:02:52.506,I reject nature!
00:02:53.715,00:02:56.217,Who's with me?!
00:03:16.113,00:03:17.364,Ha-ha!
00:03:39.678,00:03:41.055,The old ship.
00:03:41.096,00:03:43.390,No one's ever returned from there alive.
00:03:44.766,00:03:46.393,"SKIPPER: Relax, Kowalski."
00:03:46.434,00:03:48.062,There's a bird down there now.
00:03:48.103,00:03:49.980,"Look, he's fine."
00:03:53.108,00:03:55.652,Leopard seals-- nature's snakes.
00:03:55.694,00:03:57.696,Aren't snakes nature's snakes?
00:03:57.738,00:04:00.448,How should I know? I live on the flipping frozen tundra.
00:04:01.700,00:04:03.118,SKIPPER: They're going for the egg!
00:04:03.160,00:04:04.870,"Give me a way down there, ASAP!"
00:04:04.912,00:04:10.458,"All one would have to do is collect 300 feet of kelp, dry it in the..."
00:04:08.456,00:04:13.253,"Tiny and helpless, the baby penguins are frozen with fear."
00:04:13.294,00:04:18.425,"They know if they fall from this cliff, they will surely die."
00:04:18.466,00:04:20.635,"Gunter, give them a shove."
00:04:20.677,00:04:25.099,KOWALSKI: ...harnessing the jellyfish we've trained to obey simple voice commands.
00:04:27.601,00:04:28.852,"Now, that's more like it!"
00:04:41.990,00:04:43.242,"That-a-boy, Rico!"
00:04:43.283,00:04:44.576,SKIPPER: Don't let him have it!
00:04:47.079,00:04:49.706,Okay. I guess that works.
00:04:53.252,00:04:54.711,KOWALSKI: Get to high ground!
00:05:00.926,00:05:03.220,SKIPPER: Boo-yah!
00:05:06.765,00:05:10.102,KOWALSKI: I'd recommend firing it now.
00:05:10.144,00:05:12.146,"Uh, we really should fire it."
00:05:10.144,00:05:13.814,Not till we see the white of its eyes.
00:05:13.855,00:05:15.983,They're mostly pupil.
00:05:16.024,00:05:17.943,"They got to have a little bit of white, right?"
00:05:17.985,00:05:21.029,None whatsoever.
00:05:22.864,00:05:25.159,SKIPPER: Fire in the hole!
00:05:40.882,00:05:44.261,"Kowalski, analysis?"
00:05:44.303,00:05:47.555,We are really awesome at this.
00:05:47.597,00:05:50.349,"Boys, we did it!"
00:05:50.391,00:05:51.977,Mission accomplished!
00:05:52.019,00:05:53.979,"Hey, hey, we can do our thing."
00:05:54.021,00:05:55.522,High one!
00:05:55.563,00:05:57.107,Yes!
00:05:58.525,00:05:59.985,Whoa-ho!
00:06:02.029,00:06:04.447,Ooh. My bad.
00:06:05.615,00:06:07.201,Look. It's...
00:06:07.242,00:06:09.953,it's the miracle of birth.
00:06:12.497,00:06:14.291,A moment...
00:06:16.918,00:06:18.295,"Oh, that's disgusting!"
00:06:18.337,00:06:21.256,I think I have amniotic sac in my mouth!
00:06:23.508,00:06:25.260,Whoa!
00:06:27.470,00:06:30.640,Hello. Are you my family?
00:06:43.111,00:06:46.198,"You don't have a family, and we're all going to die. Sorry."
00:06:46.240,00:06:47.199,Wh-What?
00:06:47.241,00:06:50.744,What? I-I thought that was what we were all nodding about.
00:06:50.785,00:06:52.871,No one's gonna die!
00:06:52.913,00:06:53.955,"Know what you've got, kid?"
00:06:53.997,00:06:55.374,You've got us.
00:06:55.414,00:06:57.292,We've got each other.
00:06:57.334,00:07:00.921,"And if that ain't a family, I don't know what is."
00:07:04.758,00:07:06.385,So adorable.
00:07:06.425,00:07:09.428,"Kowalski, what's our trajectory?"
00:07:09.470,00:07:11.639,95% certain we're still doomed.
00:07:11.681,00:07:13.892,"And the, uh, other five percent?"
00:07:13.934,00:07:17.771,KOWALSKI: Adventure and glory like no penguins have ever seen before.
00:07:17.812,00:07:19.106,I'll take that action.
00:07:19.147,00:07:20.607,But where are we going?
00:07:20.648,00:07:22.734,"SKIPPER: The future, boys."
00:07:22.776,00:07:24.694,Glorious future!
00:07:33.453,00:07:35.414,"SKIPPER: Ah, that song!"
00:07:35.455,00:07:37.874,I swear it's gonna make me lose my salmon.
00:07:37.916,00:07:39.709,"Singing getting louder, Skipper!"
00:07:39.751,00:07:41.128,Then move faster!
00:07:41.169,00:07:43.922,Somebody get that wig off Private.
00:07:47.134,00:07:48.676,"Kowalski, status report!"
00:07:48.718,00:07:50.762,I'm really getting tired of this song.
00:07:52.513,00:07:59.229,"SKIPPER: Well, the best part of owning a circus is you can transport a cannon over state lines."
00:08:12.700,00:08:19.833,"Ten years ago on this very day, a tiny egg hatched, and our world got a little bit cuter."
00:08:19.874,00:08:30.677,"So tonight, Private, we celebrate your birthday by infiltrating the United States gold depository at Fort Knox!"
00:08:30.718,00:08:32.804,What?
00:08:32.846,00:08:35.765,The object of our unholy desire.
00:08:35.807,00:08:37.767,The butter on our biscuit.
00:08:37.809,00:08:39.353,PRIVATE: Skipper?
00:08:37.809,00:08:41.355,"Private, what's our rule about interrupting analogies?"
00:08:41.396,00:08:42.647,Sorry. Please continue.
00:08:42.689,00:08:43.982,The moment's gone.
00:08:44.024,00:08:45.400,Private ruined it.
00:08:45.442,00:08:46.943,"Sir, we're approaching our target."
00:08:49.821,00:08:51.198,"But, Skipper, I really..."
00:08:51.239,00:08:53.200,"Are you questioning my leadership, Private?"
00:08:53.241,00:08:55.076,"No, sir."
00:08:55.118,00:08:58.330,'Cause I respect a soldier with some moxie.
00:08:58.372,00:08:59.873,Really? Then I really think we should...
00:08:59.914,00:09:03.293,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:09:03.335,00:09:05.379,"Oh, look at you."
00:09:05.420,00:09:08.382,Still so adorable.
00:09:08.423,00:09:10.133,SKIPPER: Fire in the hole!
00:09:13.678,00:09:14.929,Huh?
00:09:14.971,00:09:17.974,FEMALE VOICE: 8:00. Night-night time.
00:09:18.016,00:09:19.309,Wha...?
00:09:22.729,00:09:25.190,"Private, come on!"
00:09:31.946,00:09:33.907,AUTOMATED MALE VOICE: Please enter pass code.
00:09:33.948,00:09:35.367,"Kowalski, you're up."
00:09:35.409,00:09:37.369,AUTOMATED MALE VOICE: Please enter pass code.
00:09:37.411,00:09:40.455,"Rico, sonic incursion device."
00:09:43.542,00:09:45.168,"Oh, come on, you're kidding right?"
00:09:45.210,00:09:46.420,"Kentucky, Skipper."
00:09:46.461,00:09:48.671,They do love their Flatt and Scruggs.
00:09:48.713,00:09:50.340,"AUTOMATED MALE VOICE: Y'all come in now, y'hear?"
00:09:50.382,00:09:51.591,Have yourself a iced tea.
00:10:07.607,00:10:14.364,"Private, if you could have anything you wanted in the whole wide world, what would it be?"
00:10:12.028,00:10:17.367,"Well, gee, Skipper, I think to be a meaningful and valued member of this team."
00:10:17.409,00:10:18.993,"Ah. Well, we got you something else."
00:10:22.997,00:10:24.416,A vending machine?
00:10:22.997,00:10:26.042,"Well, not just any vending machine, Private."
00:10:26.084,00:10:34.926,The last remaining home in America's nanny state for those succulent but chemically hazardous bits of puffed heaven called...
00:10:34.968,00:10:40.723,"PRIVATE: Happy ding-dong birthday, you little scamp!"
00:10:40.765,00:10:43.560,Oh-ho-ho!
00:10:50.358,00:10:52.902,"You mess with the bull, you're gonna get the horns, Private."
00:10:52.944,00:10:55.405,"Now, hit that machine and get your present."
00:10:59.033,00:11:03.163,We just broke into the most secure facility in North America.
00:11:03.204,00:11:05.165,You know what that means?
00:11:03.204,00:11:09.669,"We're wanted criminals who'll be on the lam the rest of our lives, always feeling the hot breath of Johnny Law on our necks?"
00:11:09.710,00:11:14.591,"SKIPPER: No! It means, as elite units go, we're the elitest of the elite."
00:11:14.633,00:11:16.843,Top shelf in the bureau.
00:11:16.884,00:11:19.095,"The penultimate, plus one."
00:11:21.556,00:11:23.016,Where'd Private go?
00:11:23.057,00:11:25.018,"Oh, there he is."
00:11:25.059,00:11:26.102,D-3.
00:11:26.144,00:11:28.188,"Oh, Private."
00:11:28.229,00:11:29.730,"He's $3.50, sir."
00:11:29.772,00:11:31.358,"Well, that's outrageous."
00:11:31.399,00:11:32.691,Even for Private.
00:11:33.943,00:11:35.236,"Sir, the machine is alive!"
00:11:36.946,00:11:40.367,"I don't think I like your attitude, vending machine."
00:11:40.408,00:11:41.826,Or your prices!
00:11:41.868,00:11:43.161,Release them!
00:11:48.916,00:11:50.168,What the...?
00:12:47.475,00:12:48.602,"Kowalski, analysis."
00:12:48.643,00:12:50.395,All evidence indicates...
00:12:51.896,00:12:53.940,I ate too many Cheezy Dibbles.
00:12:55.483,00:12:58.819,We're behind enemy lines and incredibly thirsty.
00:12:58.861,00:13:01.822,"Rico, bust us out of this delicious prison."
00:13:04.992,00:13:07.120,"Nice work, Rico."
00:13:07.161,00:13:10.457,You are a meaningful and valued member of this team.
00:13:17.464,00:13:18.465,Hmm.
00:13:25.305,00:13:27.140,"SKIPPER: Private, quit lollygagging."
00:13:27.181,00:13:28.933,And regular gagging.
00:13:30.351,00:13:35.814,Dark and ominous-- two of my least favorite traits in a room.
00:13:35.856,00:13:36.857,"Oh, look! A button."
00:13:36.899,00:13:38.067,"Huh? Private, don't!"
00:13:41.529,00:13:44.157,"Now, what have I told you about..."
00:13:50.871,00:13:55.794,"It looks like some sort of giant laser sent to kill us all, sir."
00:13:57.836,00:13:59.464,PRIVATE: Ooh! Another one.
00:13:59.506,00:14:00.507,ALL: No!
00:14:03.217,00:14:04.678,Huh?
00:14:04.719,00:14:06.179,"Naughty, naughty."
00:14:06.220,00:14:08.682,KOWALSKI: Huh?
00:14:08.723,00:14:12.268,Pretty birds belong in their cages.
00:14:28.409,00:14:29.369,ALL: Ew!
00:14:29.410,00:14:32.038,"Now, that's just hurtful."
00:14:32.079,00:14:34.541,And I was so happy to see you again.
00:14:34.582,00:14:37.544,Skipper...
00:14:37.585,00:14:39.420,Kowalski... Rico...
00:14:39.462,00:14:43.049,and sweet little Private.
00:14:43.090,00:14:44.300,Boop!
00:14:44.342,00:14:45.802,Who are you?
00:14:45.844,00:14:49.305,The humans know me as Dr. Octavius Brine.
00:14:49.347,00:14:57.313,"Renowned geneticist, cheese enthusiast, and frequent donor to NPR pledge drives."
00:14:57.355,00:15:01.818,"But you know me by a different, much older name."
00:15:01.860,00:15:05.488,A name perhaps you'd hoped you'd never hear again.
00:15:05.530,00:15:07.407,A phantom!
00:15:07.448,00:15:10.785,A shadow of a former life!
00:15:10.827,00:15:12.245,I...
00:15:12.286,00:15:13.747,am...
00:15:13.788,00:15:15.665,Dave!
00:15:19.627,00:15:20.920,Kowalski?
00:15:20.961,00:15:22.672,"Sorry, sir, no clue."
00:15:24.465,00:15:26.092,Dave...!
00:15:26.133,00:15:27.510,Dave!
00:15:27.552,00:15:28.678,Dave...!
00:15:28.720,00:15:29.679,Dave?
00:15:29.721,00:15:31.013,Dave...!
00:15:31.055,00:15:33.307,Dave.
00:15:40.481,00:15:42.275,Sorry.
00:15:42.316,00:15:43.526,Wait. Wait. Uh...
00:15:43.568,00:15:45.445,I... I live this way.
00:15:49.198,00:15:50.617,"Go ahead, Dan, continue."
00:15:50.658,00:15:53.327,You seriously don't remember me?
00:15:55.079,00:15:56.956,Dave! Dave! Right!
00:15:56.997,00:15:58.958,"Oh, yeah, long time."
00:15:58.999,00:16:01.043,Uh... how's the wife?
00:16:02.253,00:16:04.213,I've never been married.
00:16:04.255,00:16:10.010,"You may not remember me, but I could never forget you."
00:16:10.052,00:16:13.431,Let's shake up some old memories.
00:16:13.473,00:16:15.516,New York City.
00:16:17.894,00:16:19.729,The Central Park Zoo.
00:16:19.771,00:16:22.022,Life was good.
00:16:22.064,00:16:28.988,"Roomy tank, great location, monkey-house views."
00:16:29.029,00:16:30.740,"And, of course..."
00:16:30.782,00:16:33.117,my adoring legion of fans.
00:16:33.159,00:16:35.369,Cool.
00:16:35.411,00:16:38.498,The octopus of a thousand tricks.
00:16:39.749,00:16:40.750,Awesome!
00:16:40.792,00:16:43.043,I was the total package.
00:16:43.085,00:16:44.462,GIRL: Wow.
00:16:44.504,00:16:46.840,You got to see this.
00:16:46.881,00:16:48.299,"WOMAN: Come on, kids..."
00:16:48.341,00:16:50.134,And then you arrived.
00:16:50.176,00:16:51.469,"WOMAN: Oh, they're so adorable!"
00:16:52.679,00:16:54.388,"Just, uh, smile and wave, boys."
00:16:54.430,00:16:55.932,Smile and wave.
00:16:55.974,00:16:57.600,And took everything from me.
00:16:57.642,00:16:58.810,GIRL: They're so cute!
00:16:58.852,00:17:00.186,They are so adorable.
00:17:00.227,00:17:02.021,WOMAN: Have you ever seen anything cuter?
00:17:04.148,00:17:06.860,Four adorable baby penguins.
00:17:06.901,00:17:10.196,"With you around, no one wanted an old octopus anymore."
00:17:11.739,00:17:14.367,"Out you go, Dave."
00:17:14.408,00:17:20.206,"And so it went, over and over, at zoo after aquarium."
00:17:20.247,00:17:22.166,"I can't see the penguins, man!"
00:17:22.208,00:17:24.377,Adorable penguins stole the show.
00:17:24.418,00:17:25.461,MAN: Whoo! Yeah!
00:17:30.216,00:17:32.134,While I was shunned.
00:17:34.470,00:17:36.222,Forgotten.
00:17:40.018,00:17:41.895,Unwanted.
00:17:45.481,00:17:47.358,Alone.
00:17:50.778,00:17:52.989,That sounds awful.
00:17:53.031,00:17:55.199,"Oh, it was."
00:17:55.241,00:18:00.413,I came to realize some creatures are born to get all the love.
00:18:00.454,00:18:03.249,The rest of us get nothing!
00:18:03.290,00:18:10.590,The only thing that has kept me going all these years is my burning thirst for revenge!
00:18:12.132,00:18:15.302,And my precious souvenir snow globe collection.
00:18:20.934,00:18:23.061,What is wrong with you?!
00:18:25.354,00:18:28.942,"Oh, Daryl, Daryl, Daryl, you can't blame us for what happened to you."
00:18:28.983,00:18:30.610,"Uh, can."
00:18:30.651,00:18:33.947,That's how this whole revenge thing works.
00:18:33.988,00:18:39.535,"And with this, I finally have the power to destroy you."
00:18:39.577,00:18:40.578,Crikey!
00:18:46.584,00:18:49.003,"Nicolas, cage them."
00:18:49.045,00:18:52.048,"I've got some bad news for you, Dennis."
00:18:52.090,00:18:54.133,You messed with the wrong birds.
00:18:54.174,00:18:57.428,"Because we are an elite unit, the best of the best."
00:18:57.470,00:18:59.639,Cream of the corn on a platinum cob.
00:18:59.680,00:19:04.894,And we're gonna take your deadly green goop and sashay right out the exit hatch.
00:19:04.936,00:19:08.022,And just how are you going to do that?
00:19:08.064,00:19:10.024,Deploy secret weapon.
00:19:11.567,00:19:13.945,"Aah! The cheese, it burns!"
00:19:13.987,00:19:15.362,Roll out.
00:19:21.869,00:19:23.329,After them!
00:19:27.041,00:19:29.836,"All right, boys, it's just like Cuba."
00:19:29.877,00:19:31.671,Taxi!
00:19:36.550,00:19:39.095,How about some music?
00:19:41.722,00:19:43.141,Here they come.
00:19:44.725,00:19:46.226,Let's move.
00:19:46.268,00:19:48.521,PRIVATE: Stroke! Stroke!
00:19:48.562,00:19:51.190,Stroke some more! Stroke!
00:19:51.231,00:19:52.692,Stroke! Stroke!
00:19:52.733,00:19:54.568,Stroke! Sorry!
00:19:54.610,00:19:55.569,Stroke! Stroke!
00:20:04.578,00:20:05.955,"We got baddies, six o'clock."
00:20:05.997,00:20:08.666,"SKIPPER: Kowalski, battle formation."
00:20:11.544,00:20:14.797,Ha! So you squeegees want to do the gondola mambo?
00:20:14.839,00:20:16.799,Let's dance.
00:20:16.841,00:20:18.509,"Ow! Mother-of-pearl, that stings!"
00:20:18.551,00:20:20.178,I've lost visual.
00:20:20.219,00:20:22.221,"Kowalski, be my eyes."
00:20:22.262,00:20:23.556,"Uh, left."
00:20:23.597,00:20:25.850,"KOWALSKI: Right, right! Up!"
00:20:25.892,00:20:27.267,Duck.
00:20:28.895,00:20:30.312,SKIPPER: I think I got 'em.
00:20:30.354,00:20:31.981,"They are down, sir."
00:20:32.023,00:20:34.150,Excelente.
00:20:40.740,00:20:42.075,Skipper!
00:20:42.116,00:20:43.910,And we are running out of canal.
00:20:43.951,00:20:45.786,Parker Posey! Go all-terrain.
00:20:50.750,00:20:52.001,Will you marry me?
00:20:57.965,00:20:59.842,We've lost engine one!
00:21:02.095,00:21:04.263,And two and three.
00:21:04.304,00:21:06.015,Four!
00:21:06.057,00:21:08.017,Switch to emergency power.
00:21:08.059,00:21:09.185,"Aye, aye, Skipper."
00:21:16.776,00:21:19.153,PRIVATE: We've got melons!
00:21:29.622,00:21:31.082,I can see.
00:21:31.124,00:21:33.126,"Rico, the glowy thing!"
00:21:33.167,00:21:34.961,Aah! Venetian blinded again!
00:21:40.466,00:21:41.675,KOWALSKI: We've been boarded.
00:21:41.717,00:21:43.094,SKIPPER: Initiate self-destruct sequence.
00:21:45.471,00:21:48.557,Nice.
00:21:48.599,00:21:51.060,"Frankly, I'm surprised we had a self-destruct sequence."
00:21:59.277,00:22:01.320,"SKIPPER: All right, boys, battle stance."
00:22:01.361,00:22:03.530,"We're in battle stance, sir."
00:22:03.572,00:22:05.783,"Oh. Okay, good."
00:22:05.825,00:22:08.494,"Now we, uh, spring our trap."
00:22:09.662,00:22:13.415,"KOWALSKI: I'm not sure they're the ones that are trapped, sir."
00:22:13.457,00:22:17.044,"Kowalski, remember our little talk about true but unhelpful comments?"
00:22:17.086,00:22:18.337,"KOWALSKI: Yes, sir."
00:22:18.378,00:22:19.546,Sometimes we just have to wing it.
00:22:22.216,00:22:23.467,Wow.
00:22:36.814,00:22:39.192,"Sorry for underestimating the plan, Skipper."
00:22:39.233,00:22:40.860,"It's okay, Kowalski."
00:22:40.901,00:22:42.820,Just don't ever doubt me again.
00:22:42.862,00:22:44.822,"Now, what the heck is going on?!"
00:22:48.993,00:22:50.703,"Remain calm, penguins."
00:22:52.370,00:22:55.708,You are now under the protection of the North Wind.
00:22:55.749,00:22:57.626,You're welcome.
00:23:04.008,00:23:06.052,"Oh, my gosh."
00:23:06.093,00:23:07.887,"Aw, you guys are so cute."
00:23:07.928,00:23:10.597,"You guys are just so, so cute!"
00:23:10.639,00:23:12.599,Ooh... and cuddly.
00:23:14.434,00:23:16.354,"Hey, get away!"
00:23:16.394,00:23:19.232,It's like being licked by a basket full of puppy dogs.
00:23:19.273,00:23:20.941,Corporal!
00:23:20.983,00:23:22.400,Corporal!
00:23:22.442,00:23:24.695,Chart a course back to North Wind headquarters.
00:23:26.613,00:23:29.575,"Eva, inform them that we're bringing in witnesses."
00:23:29.616,00:23:31.577,"Private, Dibble me."
00:23:33.746,00:23:36.414,We're not going anywhere with you.
00:23:36.456,00:23:39.417,We don't even know who the heck you are.
00:23:39.459,00:23:41.795,The North Wind is an elite undercover interspe...

00:24:01.982,00:24:04.110,Dedicated to helping animals who can't help themselves.
00:24:06.153,00:24:07.988,Like penguins.
00:24:08.030,00:24:09.573,Really? And you are?
00:24:09.615,00:24:11.075,My name is classified.
00:24:11.117,00:24:12.285,"Classified, eh?"
00:24:12.326,00:24:13.911,"What is that, uh, Dutch?"
00:24:13.953,00:24:15.579,Can't really hear the accent.
00:24:15.621,00:24:16.622,There's the accent.
00:24:16.663,00:24:18.291,"No, my name isn't Classified."
00:24:18.332,00:24:22.253,My name is classified because I am the leader of this strike team.
00:24:22.295,00:24:24.630,The seal is Short Fuse-- weapons and explosives.
00:24:24.671,00:24:26.966,The bear is Corporal-- he's our muscle.
00:24:27.007,00:24:30.219,And the owl is Eva-- intelligence and analysis.
00:24:30.261,00:24:33.306,"Well, Agent Classified, we happen to be an elite unit, too."
00:24:34.932,00:24:36.474,FEMALE VOICE: Self-destruct sequence activated.
00:24:36.516,00:24:38.518,"You know, you should really label these things."
00:24:38.560,00:24:39.728,"FEMALE VOICE: In three, two, one..."
00:24:41.147,00:24:43.565,The name's Skipper.
00:24:43.607,00:24:44.858,Back there is Kowalski.
00:24:44.900,00:24:46.986,He's the brains of our operation.
00:24:47.027,00:24:48.486,"Say something smart, Kowalski."
00:24:48.528,00:24:50.323,Uh...
00:24:54.952,00:24:57.537,See? He's working on a whole nother level.
00:24:57.579,00:24:59.665,"And Rico, he's our demolition expert."
00:25:01.875,00:25:04.795,SKIPPER: He destroyed that chair for the sheer fun of it.
00:25:04.837,00:25:06.130,No reason at all.
00:25:06.172,00:25:08.548,And then there's Private.
00:25:08.590,00:25:10.676,"He's, uh..."
00:25:08.590,00:25:13.429,"he's sort of our, uh, you know, secretary/mascot."
00:25:15.014,00:25:16.849,Cute.
00:25:18.600,00:25:21.812,"Well, let's see how well cute and cuddly handles this next bit."
00:25:32.990,00:25:34.950,Nice doggy door.
00:25:41.790,00:25:43.792,PRIVATE: Wow.
00:25:43.834,00:25:45.836,KOWALSKI: Whoa. Wow.
00:25:45.878,00:25:47.880,"SKIPPER: Well, well, well."
00:25:47.921,00:25:50.049,"Not a bad place you got here, Classified."
00:25:50.090,00:25:51.217,Thank you.
00:25:51.258,00:25:52.634,That's not my name.
00:25:52.676,00:25:55.262,FEMALE VOICE: Arrival at pad 17.
00:25:55.304,00:26:03.229,"All right, tiny penguins, the best way for the North Wind to protect helpless animals like yourselves is to bring Dr. Brine to justice."
00:26:03.270,00:26:06.940,"Now, you were inside his sub, so I need to know everything you know."
00:26:06.982,00:26:08.901,Hmm?
00:26:10.568,00:26:11.904,PENGUINS: Hey!
00:26:11.945,00:26:14.990,Just tell me everything you know.
00:26:15.032,00:26:19.370,All right. Numero uno: Never trust a Dutchman in a tulip fight.
00:26:19.412,00:26:20.996,Tulip fight...
00:26:21.038,00:26:23.165,Canada is secretly training an army of Sasquatch.
00:26:23.207,00:26:24.833,Sasquatch...
00:26:23.207,00:26:27.627,"Hot dogs are, in fact, only 17 percent actual dog."
00:26:27.669,00:26:29.088,Not everything everything.
00:26:29.129,00:26:34.093,Just everything regarding your abduction by Dr. Octavius Brine.
00:26:34.134,00:26:35.261,Ah.
00:26:35.302,00:26:37.137,Why didn't you say so?
00:26:37.179,00:26:42.809,My team has uncovered that Dr. Octavius Brine is actually an individual known as Derek.
00:26:42.851,00:26:44.853,Dave.
00:26:44.895,00:26:46.021,SHORT FUSE: An octopus?
00:26:46.063,00:26:47.273,No.
00:26:47.314,00:26:49.900,Dr. Brine is not an octopus.
00:26:49.942,00:26:51.985,Precisely.
00:26:52.027,00:26:55.072,That's exactly what our intel indicated.
00:26:55.114,00:26:56.365,Release the sheep.
00:26:59.743,00:27:09.336,"What you, of course, could not know is that Dr. Brine's laboratory in Venice is secretly developing a doomsday weapon called the Medusa Serum."
00:27:09.378,00:27:12.630,"Ah, but what you don't know is that Dirk..."
00:27:12.672,00:27:15.134,Dave won't be using his bazooka serum...
00:27:15.175,00:27:17.595,Medusa Serum.
00:27:17.635,00:27:18.804,That part is accurate.
00:27:18.845,00:27:20.389,"Show him, Rico."
00:27:23.434,00:27:26.979,You...
00:27:27.020,00:27:30.441,"Well, stole the serum, saved the day, did your job for you."
00:27:30.483,00:27:32.359,Call it what you will.
00:27:33.569,00:27:34.570,Debbie!
00:27:34.612,00:27:36.322,Dave.
00:27:36.363,00:27:38.157,He hacked into our system.
00:27:40.700,00:27:41.743,Where's the sound?
00:27:41.785,00:27:43.829,D-Dave.
00:27:43.870,00:27:45.872,I can't hear anything.
00:27:45.914,00:27:47.500,Click on the button with the picture of the microphone.
00:27:47.541,00:27:49.502,"Every time a villain calls in, this happens."
00:27:49.543,00:27:50.877,Hello? Hello?
00:27:50.919,00:27:52.171,So annoying.
00:27:50.919,00:27:53.839,"Now we can hear you, but we cannot see you."
00:27:53.880,00:27:55.341,It's like talking to my parents.
00:27:55.382,00:27:56.800,How about now?
00:27:56.842,00:27:58.385,Hurray!
00:27:58.427,00:27:59.637,"Yes, we've got you; that's fantastic."
00:27:59.677,00:28:00.887,"Excellent. Now, where was I?"
00:28:02.389,00:28:04.600,Dave!
00:28:04.642,00:28:06.018,"Greetings, North Wind."
00:28:06.059,00:28:08.937,I see you've met my old zoo-mates.
00:28:08.979,00:28:10.272,We were never mates.
00:28:10.314,00:28:12.274,There was no mating.
00:28:12.316,00:28:13.775,"Turn yourself in, David."
00:28:13.817,00:28:17.695,You're powerless now that I've stolen your precious Medusa Serum.
00:28:17.737,00:28:19.365,You didn't steal that.
00:28:19.406,00:28:20.698,It's over?
00:28:20.740,00:28:24.119,Then why did I call you?
00:28:24.161,00:28:25.496,Weird.
00:28:25.538,00:28:29.375,"Oh, maybe it was to show you this."
00:28:29.416,00:28:32.710,That is a lot of serum for four penguins.
00:28:32.752,00:28:36.298,"Oh, you thought this was just about you four?"
00:28:36.340,00:28:39.051,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:28:39.092,00:28:40.678,We're just getting started.
00:28:42.429,00:28:47.393,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go do some shopping..."
00:28:47.434,00:28:49.687,for revenge!
00:28:52.772,00:28:54.400,"Wait, how do you..."
00:28:55.651,00:28:56.985,What do I push?
00:28:57.027,00:28:58.529,Is it the red or...
00:28:58.571,00:29:00.822,I thought it was the...
00:29:00.864,00:29:02.199,It's not this...
00:29:05.285,00:29:07.246,Incoming alert.
00:29:07.287,00:29:10.624,The Berlin Zoo-- 15 penguins missing.
00:29:10.666,00:29:12.292,Dave's kidnapping other penguins!
00:29:12.334,00:29:14.420,No doubt cute and cuddly.
00:29:14.461,00:29:16.422,BOTH: We have to move! What?
00:29:16.463,00:29:17.839,Time for our A-game.
00:29:17.881,00:29:19.258,"Corporal, ready the jet."
00:29:19.299,00:29:22.636,I'm initiating North Wind Protocol Zeta.
00:29:22.678,00:29:24.638,12 more penguins taken from London Zoo.
00:29:24.680,00:29:26.765,"Okay, boys, this is it."
00:29:26.806,00:29:29.727,The mission we've been preparing for our entire lives.
00:29:29.768,00:29:32.771,We're gonna take down Dave or die trying.
00:29:32.812,00:29:34.607,"Kowalski, cancel our improv class!"
00:29:34.648,00:29:36.400,"Yes, sir."
00:29:36.442,00:29:37.943,"Private, do that little thing I like."
00:29:40.738,00:29:42.281,"Skipper, good news."
00:29:42.322,00:29:44.450,I got them to credit our class.
00:29:44.491,00:29:46.034,"Sir, the jet is ready."
00:29:46.076,00:29:47.369,"SKIPPER: Oh, yeah, baby!"
00:29:47.411,00:29:48.787,Just like Super Bowl 19!
00:29:48.828,00:29:49.871,They're stealing my stuff!
00:29:49.913,00:29:51.457,No!
00:29:51.498,00:29:54.793,This mission has no place for a pathetic waddle of useless penguins!
00:29:54.834,00:29:55.835,Who are you calling pathetic?
00:29:55.877,00:29:56.878,Enough!
00:29:59.965,00:30:02.301,"See, Rico, that's why you can't have nice things."
00:30:03.719,00:30:04.844,Ooh!
00:30:06.179,00:30:08.265,"I'm, uh, pretty good with computers myself."
00:30:17.650,00:30:21.361,"SHORT FUSE: Put on your jammies, penguin."
00:30:21.403,00:30:23.905,Aw.
00:30:23.947,00:30:25.198,Not to me.
00:30:25.240,00:30:29.536,I want these butterballs out of my way and out of my mission.
00:30:29.578,00:30:31.580,Ship them to one of our safe houses.
00:30:31.622,00:30:33.749,The most remote place on the planet.
00:30:40.046,00:30:42.174,Where the heck are we?
00:30:42.215,00:30:44.968,KOWALSKI: Oxygen content is low.
00:30:45.010,00:30:47.012,I suggest we limit our breathing.
00:30:48.555,00:30:49.682,"SKIPPER: Aw, Private!"
00:30:53.018,00:30:55.020,Sorry!
00:30:55.061,00:30:56.396,Toot sweet! He does.
00:30:56.438,00:30:57.939,We must be on a plane.
00:30:59.899,00:31:02.194,What did North Wind do to us?
00:31:02.235,00:31:05.447,"Ooh, they gave us badges."
00:31:05.489,00:31:08.158,"Not badges, tranquilizer darts."
00:31:08.200,00:31:10.410,Classified!
00:31:10.452,00:31:14.080,That low-down dirty dog is trying kick us off the mission.
00:31:14.122,00:31:18.126,He thinks we can't save the penguins because we're just penguins.
00:31:18.168,00:31:20.462,"Well, penguins are our flesh and feathers."
00:31:20.504,00:31:21.839,They're us.
00:31:21.880,00:31:24.966,"And if anyone's gonna save us, it's us."
00:31:25.008,00:31:27.803,"But, Skipper, we've got to be five miles up."
00:31:27.845,00:31:29.596,That pretty much limits our options.
00:31:29.638,00:31:32.432,I make my own options.
00:31:37.604,00:31:41.775,"Brilliant move, Skipper, but now we seem to be outside the plane."
00:31:41.817,00:31:44.277,"Well, kind of got caught up in the moment."
00:31:44.319,00:31:46.405,"Well, hindsight's 20/20."
00:31:46.446,00:31:49.324,"Okay, Kowalski, your turn to pick up the slack."
00:31:49.366,00:31:50.617,Uh...
00:31:50.659,00:31:52.369,"Oh, why don't we catch that plane?"
00:31:52.411,00:31:54.246,Whoa!
00:31:54.287,00:31:56.122,"Bird strike, log it."
00:31:57.833,00:31:59.877,KOWALSKI: We've got another target at 12 o'clock.
00:31:59.918,00:32:01.670,"Good, it's only 11:30."
00:32:01.712,00:32:03.004,"Follow me, boys!"
00:32:03.046,00:32:05.758,We're going in hot.
00:32:05.799,00:32:07.926,"Hot, hot, hot!"
00:32:07.967,00:32:09.511,"No one likes a show-off, Private."
00:32:09.553,00:32:11.430,KOWALSKI: Aim for first class!
00:32:15.726,00:32:18.144,I'm okay!
00:32:18.186,00:32:20.773,"Kowalski, where does this aircraft go?"
00:32:20.814,00:32:24.109,"From the odd shape of this bagel, I'd say we're headed for Paris."
00:32:24.150,00:32:25.611,France? Forget it!
00:32:25.652,00:32:27.112,Not with their tax laws!
00:32:27.153,00:32:28.864,Then I would suggest a mid-air transfer.
00:32:28.906,00:32:30.449,Affirmative.
00:32:30.490,00:32:32.534,"Peanuts, peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut!"
00:32:32.576,00:32:34.453,"We're out of peanuts, Skipper!"
00:32:36.622,00:32:38.081,Bingo.
00:32:38.123,00:32:39.792,"There's our ride, boys."
00:32:39.833,00:32:41.668,"Can't stay, doll."
00:32:41.710,00:32:43.712,Danger is my mistress.
00:32:43.754,00:32:45.088,"Aah! Rico, more height."
00:32:45.130,00:32:46.465,Pretzels!
00:32:46.506,00:32:48.300,Pretzels!
00:32:48.341,00:32:50.594,We're out of pretzels!
00:32:48.341,00:32:52.596,"Yeah? Then we're leaving just time, 'cause these folks are gonna freak!"
00:32:52.638,00:32:54.514,KOWALSKI: Deploy flaps.
00:32:55.599,00:32:57.267,SKIPPER: Stay on target!
00:32:58.977,00:33:01.396,"PRIVATE: We're gonna catch it, we're gonna catch it!"
00:33:01.438,00:33:03.523,Crikey! We're not gonna catch it!
00:33:03.565,00:33:05.651,"Wait a minute, where's Skipper?"
00:33:06.860,00:33:09.154,Time to get creative.
00:33:09.195,00:33:11.490,"Start grabbing boxes, boys."
00:33:13.909,00:33:15.702,Ooh!
00:33:15.744,00:33:18.330,"Oh, Private, stop playing with those backpacks."
00:33:18.371,00:33:19.706,Find something useful.
00:33:21.708,00:33:23.168,Now we're talking.
00:33:23.209,00:33:24.503,Let's get to work.
00:33:24.544,00:33:25.754,400 meters.
00:33:25.796,00:33:27.130,300 meters!
00:33:27.172,00:33:28.882,"Speak American, Kowalski!"
00:33:28.924,00:33:30.926,"Sorry, sir. 218 yards."
00:33:30.968,00:33:32.845,109 yards.
00:33:41.561,00:33:42.855,"Okay, then."
00:33:42.896,00:33:44.898,It's clear what we need to do next.
00:33:50.529,00:33:52.322,KOWALSKI: That feels right.
00:33:52.364,00:33:54.783,"Impressive bouncing, boys."
00:33:54.825,00:33:57.035,"Now, then, back to civilization."
00:33:57.076,00:34:02.207,"If we're gonna take Dexter down, we need to know where he's gonna strike next."
00:34:13.051,00:34:14.344,Yeah!
00:34:14.386,00:34:16.346,ALL: Goal...!
00:34:16.388,00:34:18.306,ALL: Huh?
00:34:20.392,00:34:24.521,"Elijah, would you please take them away."
00:34:34.781,00:34:37.158,"EVA: Penguin footprints, still warm."
00:34:37.200,00:34:38.577,We just missed Dave.
00:34:38.618,00:34:40.328,"Aw, blast it, he's gone."
00:34:40.370,00:34:42.622,So many penguins!
00:34:45.291,00:34:46.752,Boss! He's stress-eating again!
00:34:46.793,00:34:48.461,Corporal?
00:34:48.503,00:34:50.129,Rub the angry out of the tummy.
00:34:50.171,00:34:53.091,Corporal? Fo... focus.
00:34:53.132,00:34:57.262,"We are going to save those helpless penguins, because..."
00:34:57.303,00:35:01.099,"we are the North Wind, and no one..."
00:35:01.140,00:35:04.310,no one breaks the Wind.
00:35:05.645,00:35:07.940,No one breaks the Wind.
00:35:07.981,00:35:09.691,There's a good Corporal.
00:35:09.733,00:35:12.235,"Now, we rescued those four penguins already, didn't we?"
00:35:12.277,00:35:16.281,Shipped them off all cozy and snug to a Madagascar...
00:35:16.322,00:35:20.953,"Sir, those penguins-- they never made it to Madagascar."
00:35:20.994,00:35:22.287,What?
00:35:22.328,00:35:24.330,"Well, where the dickens are they?"
00:35:28.376,00:35:30.169,"Kowalski, what are our coordinates?"
00:35:30.211,00:35:34.841,"From my calculations, we've arrived in the center of Dublin, Ireland."
00:35:38.177,00:35:40.388,"All right, soldiers, we got to blend in."
00:35:40.430,00:35:41.974,Riverdance.
00:35:47.520,00:35:50.189,"No time to kiss the Blarney stone, boys."
00:35:50.231,00:35:53.986,"We need to find intel on Dave's location, pronto."
00:35:55.904,00:35:57.572,SKIPPER: Aha!
00:35:59.032,00:36:00.659,"All right, you, where's Dave!"
00:36:00.700,00:36:02.077,Give us the goods.
00:36:02.119,00:36:03.495,Spit it out!
00:36:03.536,00:36:04.830,Don't make me use shillelagh!
00:36:04.871,00:36:06.289,That's a baby squid.
00:36:10.376,00:36:12.170,"Sorry, laddie."
00:36:12.211,00:36:13.964,Ugh!
00:36:14.006,00:36:17.258,Stranded on the Emerald Isle without a single clue.
00:36:17.300,00:36:19.260,"Well, so much for the luck o' the Irish."
00:36:19.302,00:36:20.261,"KOWALSKI: Skipper, look!"
00:36:20.303,00:36:21.346,Huh?
00:36:24.599,00:36:26.643,SKIPPER: Begorrah!
00:36:26.685,00:36:28.186,Does anyone speak Gaelic?
00:36:28.227,00:36:30.689,No. But it looks like Dave's been busy.
00:36:30.730,00:36:33.566,He's stolen penguins from Guadalajara!
00:36:33.608,00:36:35.193,Madrid!
00:36:35.234,00:36:37.236,KOWALSKI: Athens!
00:36:37.278,00:36:39.447,KOWALSKI: Dusseldorf!
00:36:39.489,00:36:41.282,PRIVATE: Osaka!
00:36:41.324,00:36:43.118,PRIVATE: Nairobi!
00:36:43.160,00:36:44.828,PRIVATE: Baton Rouge!
00:36:44.870,00:36:47.164,Dave's snow globe collection.
00:36:47.205,00:36:50.500,It's every zoo and aquarium he got kicked out of!
00:36:50.542,00:36:55.005,"Don't tell me where he has been, tell me where he will have has been next."
00:36:55.047,00:36:57.883,"Wait, what is it, Rico?"
00:36:57.924,00:36:59.592,It's a film! It's a play!
00:36:59.634,00:37:00.593,First word.
00:37:00.635,00:37:01.594,Two syllables.
00:37:01.636,00:37:02.679,Sounds like...
00:37:02.721,00:37:03.680,huuh!
00:37:03.722,00:37:04.681,Sounds like huuh?
00:37:04.723,00:37:07.976,Sounds like hyech!
00:37:13.398,00:37:15.316,Shanghai.
00:37:15.358,00:37:17.527,"Dave hasn't been there yet, Skipper."
00:37:17.569,00:37:20.030,"If we hurry, we can still stop him."
00:37:20.072,00:37:21.823,"Nice work, Rico."
00:37:21.865,00:37:23.616,"Pack your bagpipes, boys."
00:37:23.658,00:37:25.869,It's time to blow this potato stand.
00:37:40.175,00:37:41.509,So this is it.
00:37:41.551,00:37:44.721,Shanghai's famous Little Dublin district.
00:37:44.763,00:37:46.264,"Skipper, look!"
00:37:46.305,00:37:48.349,"I see you, Private."
00:37:48.391,00:37:50.685,Who's the big boy standing on his tippy-toes?
00:37:50.727,00:37:53.188,"Wha...? No, I mean..."
00:37:53.230,00:37:55.190,"Skipper, look! Above Private!"
00:37:55.232,00:37:58.568,Dave's next target-- Shanghai's famous mermaid penguins.
00:37:58.610,00:38:00.153,"SKIPPER: Good eye, Kowalski."
00:38:00.195,00:38:05.450,"And once again, you've proved that you are a meaningful and valued member of this team."
00:38:07.035,00:38:15.376,"Ladies and gentlemen, Shanghai Marine World is pleased to present our world-famous Mermaid Penguins!"
00:38:18.337,00:38:24.219,"Tonight, our mermaids dedicate their performance to all the missing penguins around the world."
00:38:24.261,00:38:26.805,"Stay safe, little guys, wherever you are."
00:38:26.846,00:38:29.724,And we hope you come home real soon.
00:38:34.687,00:38:36.606,"Now, keep those eyes roving, boys."
00:38:36.648,00:38:39.192,Dave is a master of disguise.
00:38:39.234,00:38:43.571,"He could be a small child, a house plant, maybe even you or me!"
00:38:43.613,00:38:45.406,"Is it you, Kowalski?"
00:38:45.448,00:38:48.326,"Hey, hold on."
00:38:48.367,00:38:50.662,Huh?
00:38:50.703,00:38:51.663,Ha!
00:38:51.704,00:38:52.580,Wait a minute.
00:38:55.583,00:38:57.627,"Bingo! Nice try, Dave!"
00:38:57.669,00:39:00.421,"Operation Flash, Splash and Crash is a go!"
00:39:00.463,00:39:01.422,Splendid!
00:39:01.464,00:39:03.049,Take positions.
00:39:03.091,00:39:06.719,Penguin feeding time will begin in two minutes.
00:39:15.020,00:39:16.980,"Target, 30 yards and closing."
00:39:17.022,00:39:19.191,"In position, Skipper."
00:39:20.275,00:39:21.985,"SKIPPER: Rico, report."
00:39:22.027,00:39:23.653,In position.
00:39:23.695,00:39:24.654,"For you, Private."
00:39:24.696,00:39:25.655,"Yes, Skipper!"
00:39:25.697,00:39:26.656,Here's your mermaid costume.
00:39:26.698,00:39:27.657,What?
00:39:27.699,00:39:29.367,We need a diversion.
00:39:29.408,00:39:32.204,"And, frankly, you're the only one who can pull off that look."
00:39:32.245,00:39:33.705,"But I can do more, Skipper."
00:39:33.746,00:39:35.373,I want to help the team.
00:39:35.414,00:39:37.000,Really help the team.
00:39:37.042,00:39:41.379,"If you think I'm ready, Assuming you agree."
00:39:41.420,00:39:44.382,And perhaps even...
00:39:44.423,00:39:52.224,"I like the moxie, soldier, but right now, I need a tail on that tush and the cutest smile you've got."
00:39:52.265,00:39:54.142,"You trust me, soldier?"
00:39:56.311,00:39:58.563,"Aye, aye, Skipper."
00:39:58.604,00:40:00.398,"MAN: Hey, it's feeding time!"
00:40:02.942,00:40:04.319,"Target, ten yards from flashpoint."
00:40:05.403,00:40:07.322,"Private, you're up."
00:40:08.447,00:40:10.075,You just mermaid my day.
00:40:11.117,00:40:13.078,Flash is a go!
00:40:13.119,00:40:15.372,"Look, they let one of the mermaids out of the tank!"
00:40:15.413,00:40:16.748,"Oh, she's so cute."
00:40:16.789,00:40:18.083,It's the cutest thing I've ever seen.
00:40:18.124,00:40:21.419,Shields up!
00:40:24.964,00:40:26.132,Target is stunned.
00:40:26.174,00:40:27.550,"Rico, bring the Splash."
00:40:38.811,00:40:40.646,Huh?
00:40:44.192,00:40:45.360,Yeah!
00:40:54.327,00:40:55.787,"Oh, what are you doing out here, cutie?"
00:40:55.828,00:40:57.122,Come on.
00:40:57.163,00:40:59.540,Back in your tank.
00:41:02.001,00:41:03.502,Secure the mermaids and find me...
00:41:06.381,00:41:07.715,...David the octopus.
00:41:09.968,00:41:11.844,"A little late, North Wind."
00:41:14.472,00:41:17.016,Mission accomplished.
00:41:17.058,00:41:19.352,High one!
00:41:19.394,00:41:23.522,"Corporal, take our prisoner-- the one that belongs to us-- into custody."
00:41:23.564,00:41:24.857,What?
00:41:24.899,00:41:26.025,You melted him?!
00:41:26.067,00:41:27.402,You birds are sick!
00:41:29.946,00:41:32.198,He's going in through the pipes!
00:41:36.369,00:41:38.037,Skipper!
00:41:38.079,00:41:39.831,Private? Private!
00:41:39.872,00:41:41.416,You got to get out of there!
00:41:41.458,00:41:42.667,"No, no, no."
00:41:42.708,00:41:44.127,"No, no, no, no."
00:41:44.169,00:41:46.338,Private!
00:41:46.379,00:41:48.006,Private!
00:41:48.047,00:41:49.341,Help!
00:41:49.382,00:41:50.842,Okay.
00:41:50.883,00:41:52.385,Here we go.
00:41:52.427,00:41:54.262,"Move, move, move!"
00:41:58.057,00:41:59.309,He's got Private!
00:41:59.351,00:42:01.060,He's getting away.
00:42:01.102,00:42:02.979,"Skipper, the North Wind's plane."
00:42:03.021,00:42:04.647,Sweet chariot of the gods!
00:42:04.689,00:42:05.982,"But can you fly it, man?"
00:42:06.024,00:42:07.942,There's only one way to find out.
00:42:11.904,00:42:14.115,"No, I, uh..."
00:42:14.157,00:42:16.117,still can't read.
00:42:16.159,00:42:17.660,Then we're going off-book.
00:42:25.918,00:42:27.545,"No! No, no, no, no!"
00:42:29.464,00:42:32.467,"SKIPPER: Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much!"
00:42:38.931,00:42:40.641,"I'm getting the hang of this, Skipper."
00:42:40.683,00:42:42.519,EVA: Pull off!
00:42:42.560,00:42:44.896,"Good! We're coming for you, Private!"
00:42:46.898,00:42:50.818,Those ludicrous butterballs are letting David escape!
00:42:50.860,00:42:52.320,"Eva, secure transport."
00:42:52.362,00:42:54.155,"Short Fuse, Corporal, hitch us a ride."
00:43:00.619,00:43:01.829,Fire!
00:43:04.874,00:43:06.834,Go fetch.
00:43:20.306,00:43:22.183,Hold her steady.
00:43:32.360,00:43:33.486,"Sir, Dave is pulling ahead."
00:43:33.528,00:43:35.029,We are too heavy.
00:43:35.071,00:43:37.865,"Oh, curse our heavily cheese-dibbled diet!"
00:43:37.907,00:43:39.784,"Rico, give me a West Helsinki fire sale."
00:43:39.825,00:43:41.369,"Yeah, yeah."
00:43:49.419,00:43:50.962,Ow!
00:43:51.003,00:43:52.464,"That's everything, sir."
00:43:52.505,00:43:53.965,Have you purged the chemical toilet?
00:43:54.006,00:43:55.758,But Rico was in there for 15 minutes!
00:43:55.800,00:43:58.010,Just do it!
00:44:07.103,00:44:08.480,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
00:44:11.816,00:44:15.528,"Self-destruct sequence in five, No, Private!"

00:44:53.566,00:44:55.193,...or land in sight.
00:44:57.903,00:44:59.405,Kowalski is sick as a dog.
00:45:00.865,00:45:03.409,And Rico keeps trying to eat him.
00:45:03.451,00:45:05.744,"Just, please, just cut it out."
00:45:08.581,00:45:12.210,Not sure how long we can hold on.
00:45:12.251,00:45:14.379,This may be my final entry.

00:45:19.133,00:45:24.721,"SHORT FUSE: Oh, I have never been more hydrated in my life."
00:45:24.763,00:45:27.766,Let me cut you a piece of the salmon.
00:45:27.808,00:45:29.143,I'm stuffed.
00:45:27.808,00:45:30.687,It's the most delicious thing on the boat.
00:45:30.727,00:45:32.605,my utility belt.
00:45:32.647,00:45:34.065,Just dump it in the ocean.
00:45:35.900,00:45:38.944,"You know, we're all in the same boat here."
00:45:38.986,00:45:40.613,"Actually, we're not."
00:45:40.655,00:45:47.620,And perhaps you could express a little more concern over the fact that you stole and destroyed a $19 million vehicle!
00:45:48.829,00:45:50.248,Bill me.
00:45:51.583,00:45:52.917,Corporal?
00:45:52.958,00:45:55.169,"We're picking up a signal, sir."
00:45:55.211,00:45:57.589,Huh?
00:45:55.211,00:46:01.092,"It's five klicks southwest, but it stopped at that remote island."
00:46:01.133,00:46:04.262,Land?
00:46:04.303,00:46:06.639,Good on you.
00:46:06.681,00:46:08.307,"No, silly willy."
00:46:08.349,00:46:11.728,We've been tracking your little secretary/mascot.
00:46:11.768,00:46:13.896,What? You put a homing device on Private?
00:46:13.938,00:46:17.149,"All of you, actually, when I darted you."
00:46:17.191,00:46:26.451,"You low-down, dirty, mangy, filthy, flea-bitten, bum-sniffing toilet drinker!"
00:46:28.286,00:46:31.330,But... good.
00:46:31.372,00:46:33.165,"See, I told you."
00:46:33.207,00:46:36.419,You should've left this to the professionals.

00:47:21.172,00:47:22.881,DAVE: Ahoy there!
00:47:28.095,00:47:31.932,I bet you're all just dying to know why I brought you here.
00:47:31.974,00:47:34.727,He's gonna kill us all!
00:47:38.272,00:47:41.192,My Medusa Serum doesn't kill anyone.
00:47:41.233,00:47:43.152,Where's the fun in that?
00:47:43.194,00:47:45.237,"So, um, what does it do?"
00:47:45.279,00:47:48.865,"Something much, much worse."
00:47:50.034,00:47:51.243,Right.
00:47:51.285,00:47:54.038,"But, like, what specifically?"
00:47:54.079,00:47:58.626,"Well, that's exactly what I came up here to show you."
00:47:58.668,00:48:00.545,All I need is a test subject.
00:48:01.838,00:48:03.464,"Hello, little buggy-boo!"
00:48:03.506,00:48:05.424,Is this about the chirping?
00:48:05.466,00:48:07.092,Whoa!
00:48:07.134,00:48:14.726,"Behold, as I unleash the full power of the Medusa Serum."
00:48:14.767,00:48:16.101,Fire!
00:48:22.734,00:48:25.069,Yes! It works!
00:48:26.987,00:48:28.905,I made a monster.
00:48:28.947,00:48:31.784,I made a monster!
00:48:31.826,00:48:35.037,And all you adorable penguins are next!
00:48:35.079,00:48:36.748,Crikey!
00:48:36.789,00:48:38.541,Huh? Who said that?
00:48:40.251,00:48:41.544,No.
00:48:42.712,00:48:45.047,No. No.
00:48:49.343,00:48:50.636,Yes!
00:48:50.678,00:48:53.765,"Gentlemen, you remember Private."
00:48:53.806,00:48:55.516,"Oh, hey."
00:48:55.558,00:48:57.810,"You'll never get away with this, Dave."
00:48:57.852,00:49:03.566,"My brothers are coming, and together we'll take a wrecking ball to your whole rotten operation."
00:49:03.608,00:49:06.193,"Call off the hunt, everyone."
00:49:06.235,00:49:11.908,Turns out the elite unit will be coming to us.
00:49:11.948,00:49:13.868,Boop.
00:49:20.666,00:49:22.668,Eva?
00:49:22.710,00:49:25.170,What do you see?
00:49:25.212,00:49:27.590,My count is 30 hostiles.
00:49:27.632,00:49:31.009,KOWALSKI: 31.
00:49:31.051,00:49:34.096,"Uh, those two are very close together."
00:49:34.138,00:49:40.185,"I-I mean, you know, intertwined, physically, but..."
00:49:40.227,00:49:42.688,"Ixnay on the irtflay, Kowalski."
00:49:42.730,00:49:44.941,Poor Private.
00:49:44.981,00:49:49.320,"Alone, helpless in the belly of that beast."
00:49:49.361,00:49:55.451,"We've faced some long odds before, Skipper, but these look like the longest and oddest."
00:49:55.493,00:49:59.204,"If we're gonna pull this off, we'll need a diversion."

00:50:01.791,00:50:02.959,Shh! Would you be quiet?

00:50:02.999,00:50:07.546,"Short Fuse, you were supposed to handcuff them to the rock!"
00:50:07.588,00:50:08.714,Don't you hologram me!
00:50:08.756,00:50:10.090,"I tried, but they don't have hands."
00:50:10.132,00:50:11.509,"They just have flippers, boss."
00:50:11.550,00:50:13.177,And-and I have flippers!
00:50:13.218,00:50:14.846,So it's flipping useless!
00:50:14.887,00:50:16.221,"All right, pooch."
00:50:16.263,00:50:19.976,"If you won't work with us, you better work for us."
00:50:20.016,00:50:22.060,Our plan requires a diversion.
00:50:22.102,00:50:23.646,I give the orders around here.
00:50:23.688,00:50:28.776,"Much as it pains me, I need you to act as our diversion for our operation, understood?"
00:50:28.818,00:50:31.779,"Nope! This is our plan, and it requires you to cause a diversion."
00:50:31.821,00:50:33.614,Die-version.
00:50:33.656,00:50:36.408,"Die, die, die, die, die, die!"

00:50:40.955,00:50:42.414,We should kiss.
00:50:42.456,00:50:44.416,"Yep, plan-off."
00:50:44.458,00:50:46.585,That's what I was gonna say.
00:50:46.627,00:50:48.587,Plan-off.
00:50:50.172,00:50:52.591,Here's Dave's sub.
00:50:52.633,00:50:58.931,"And this young, helpless, vulnerable rock is Private."
00:50:58.973,00:51:00.182,And here's Dave.

00:51:13.988,00:51:17.366,"Now, that's what I'm talking about, big fella!"
00:51:17.408,00:51:24.790,"With Private freshly liberated, we celebrate with a well-earned high one, and feast off Dave's sweet remains."
00:51:24.832,00:51:26.542,Any questions?

00:51:48.522,00:51:50.649,My apologies.
00:51:50.691,00:51:52.359,The schematic's a little crude.
00:51:52.401,00:51:54.152,Where is that music coming from?
00:51:54.194,00:51:57.489,Wow.
00:51:54.194,00:52:03.328,"AGENT CLASSIFIED: All right, at 2150, Skipper, Kowalski and-- Richard, was it?-- die-vert the octopi away from their posts."
00:52:03.370,00:52:09.501,"At 2200, Short Fuse breaches the hull with a swarm of self-guided underwater nano-charges."
00:52:10.544,00:52:11.670,I call them wet kabooms.
00:52:11.712,00:52:12.755,"Yes, please don't."
00:52:12.797,00:52:14.757,"SHORT FUSE: Okay, sorry."
00:52:12.797,00:52:16.216,"At 2202, knock, knock."
00:52:16.258,00:52:17.676,The North Wind.
00:52:17.718,00:52:19.845,The North Wind who?
00:52:17.718,00:52:24.100,The North Wind who doesn't have time for knock-knock jokes because we're too busy taking down Dave.
00:52:24.140,00:52:25.350,Personal hover tank...
00:52:25.392,00:52:26.351,check.
00:52:26.393,00:52:27.937,Auto-targeting wing mounts.
00:52:27.979,00:52:28.980,Why not?
00:52:29.021,00:52:33.525,"At 2209, mission accomplished."
00:52:33.567,00:52:35.360,See that?
00:52:35.402,00:52:38.072,"There's a huge explosion, and I just keep walking."
00:52:41.117,00:52:42.200,"Way to go, boss!"
00:52:42.242,00:52:45.329,"That's North Wind, sucker!"
00:52:49.875,00:52:52.962,"La-di, blah, blah, blah, blah."
00:52:53.004,00:52:56.256,A good plan is about more than effecty stuff and...
00:52:56.298,00:52:57.883,vocabulary words.
00:52:57.925,00:53:07.476,"you... you certainly know a good plan-- I mean, your operation in Shanghai allowed Dave to escape with... your boy."
00:53:07.518,00:53:11.438,I've never lost a member of my team.
00:53:11.480,00:53:14.399,It must feel... awful.
00:53:16.401,00:53:20.948,"Can't imagine the guilt, the regret, the feeling that, uh, I don't know, that..."
00:53:20.990,00:53:23.993,it should have been you.
00:53:31.291,00:53:33.251,All for penguin plan?
00:53:35.337,00:53:38.007,All for North Wind plan?
00:53:43.261,00:53:44.805,His...
00:53:44.847,00:53:46.932,his is better.
00:53:46.974,00:53:48.059,What?
00:53:50.811,00:53:54.648,"I'm sorry, boys, but I can't lead you this time."
00:53:56.525,00:53:58.777,"we're a team, and..."
00:53:58.819,00:54:00.988,"and you're our skipper, Skipper."
00:54:01.030,00:54:03.365,We don't...
00:54:03.407,00:54:07.327,"No, Kowalski, but Private does."
00:54:07.369,00:54:09.121,I think...
00:54:09.163,00:54:11.999,it's time we leave it to the professionals.
00:54:12.041,00:54:13.709,"But, sir..."
00:54:13.751,00:54:16.420,We take our orders from Agent Classified now.
00:54:16.461,00:54:19.464,"That's an order, Rico!"
00:54:26.972,00:54:29.307,"All right, Classified..."
00:54:29.349,00:54:32.477,what's the diversion?
00:54:41.528,00:54:43.906,to our graves.
00:54:43.948,00:54:45.116,Agreed.
00:55:08.806,00:55:10.641,ALL: Hey!
00:55:20.484,00:55:22.694,Time?
00:55:22.736,00:55:25.114,Time to take down Dave.
00:55:48.262,00:55:52.099,"David the octopus, show me your tentacles."
00:55:55.393,00:55:56.394,All of them.
00:55:59.148,00:56:01.692,Ow!
00:56:16.040,00:56:18.583,"We lost them, Skipper."
00:56:18.625,00:56:22.504,These hosen are riding up my bundesliga.
00:56:22.546,00:56:26.758,"All right, boys, grab your coconuts and hold 'em tight."
00:56:26.800,00:56:33.265,Classified should be walking away from a huge explosion with Private on his shoulder in three... two...
00:56:33.307,00:56:35.267,"Give 'em a welcome home, Rico!"
00:56:37.644,00:56:40.605,Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
00:56:40.647,00:56:42.107,The Private is back!
00:56:42.149,00:56:43.483,"Welcome home, Private!"
00:56:43.525,00:56:44.776,Yeah! All right!
00:56:44.818,00:56:46.028,Here we go.
00:56:46.070,00:56:47.445,All right.
00:56:47.487,00:56:51.407,"Sir, the sub didn't explode, and, uh..."
00:56:51.449,00:56:52.868,I fear the...
00:56:52.910,00:56:54.619,fireworks may have been a tactical mistake.
00:57:04.629,00:57:07.716,SHORT FUSE: Stay calm! Do not panic!
00:57:07.758,00:57:09.218,We will still win!
00:57:09.260,00:57:11.387,Be full of love! Don't hate!
00:57:11.427,00:57:12.763,Follow your dreams!
00:57:12.804,00:57:14.890,Love yourself!
00:57:14.932,00:57:16.308,Pick and choose your battles in life!
00:57:16.350,00:57:17.935,Don't let anyone tell you what to do!
00:57:17.976,00:57:20.145,Ignore the haters!
00:57:20.187,00:57:21.939,Love the one you're with!
00:57:21.980,00:57:23.148,Love the one you're with!
00:57:25.692,00:57:27.569,I know.
00:57:34.618,00:57:36.787,"Welcome, Skipper, Kowalski and rootin'-tootin' Rico!"
00:57:36.828,00:57:37.788,The gang's all here!
00:57:37.829,00:57:40.165,The mood is electric!
00:57:40.207,00:57:43.501,"Is this really, finally everybody?"
00:57:43.543,00:57:45.587,"All right, Dave, just what have you done with..."
00:57:45.629,00:57:46.588,Private!
00:57:46.630,00:57:47.839,Oh! Guys!
00:57:47.881,00:57:50.050,"You're in for it now, Dave!"
00:57:50.092,00:57:51.343,Really?!
00:57:51.385,00:57:53.678,"Anyway, great catching up."
00:57:53.720,00:57:57.015,"Now, who's ready to move on to live penguin testing?"
00:57:57.057,00:58:01.478,SKIPPER: You point that death ray away from Private right now!
00:58:01.519,00:58:04.022,He's gonna turn us into monsters!
00:58:04.064,00:58:05.357,Yepper-doo!
00:58:05.399,00:58:07.359,"And what comes next, Dave?"
00:58:07.401,00:58:09.111,Invasion!
00:58:09.153,00:58:14.158,"Oh, horrible mutant penguins unleashed on the streets of New York City!"
00:58:14.199,00:58:15.451,You're the monster!
00:58:15.492,00:58:16.452,Yes!
00:58:16.493,00:58:18.245,I'm the monster.
00:58:18.287,00:58:23.541,Everyone made that clear to me every day of my entire life.
00:58:23.583,00:58:28.380,"But now, let's see how much everyone loves you when you're the monster!"
00:58:28.422,00:58:31.008,SKIPPER: You can't take away Private's cuteness!
00:58:31.049,00:58:33.218,He's the cute one!
00:58:33.260,00:58:35.637,What?
00:58:35.679,00:58:36.680,DAVE: Hmm.
00:58:36.721,00:58:38.307,You are super cute.
00:58:38.349,00:58:40.184,We better crank this up.
00:58:40.225,00:58:42.186,"Drew, Barry, more power."
00:58:42.227,00:58:43.312,Ready?
00:58:43.354,00:58:44.771,Negotiations have broken down.
00:58:44.813,00:58:46.982,"Rico, the paper clip!"
00:58:48.025,00:58:49.151,We need that paper clip!
00:58:49.193,00:58:50.486,"Chop-chop, soldier!"
00:58:54.365,00:58:56.408,No! Where's the paper clip!
00:58:58.369,00:58:59.244,Private!
00:59:06.668,00:59:07.544,No!
00:59:13.175,00:59:14.343,Private...
00:59:17.221,00:59:19.931,I disintegrated him.
00:59:19.973,00:59:22.434,That wasn't supposed to happen.
00:59:22.476,00:59:24.061,You maniac!
00:59:24.102,00:59:25.562,You blew him up!
00:59:25.603,00:59:28.023,No.
00:59:28.065,00:59:31.318,"Oh, well, this is why we test things, people."
00:59:31.360,00:59:34.654,I'll have to lower the power for the others.
00:59:36.114,00:59:37.574,"Full speed ahead, gentlemen."
00:59:37.615,00:59:41.203,The monsters are due in Manhattan!
00:59:52.256,00:59:54.132,Ooh...
01:00:08.272,01:00:10.065,PRIVATE: Sorry.
01:00:21.535,01:00:23.370,Crikey.
01:00:23.412,01:00:26.290,"All right, all right, octopus."
01:00:26.331,01:00:28.875,"Whatever Dave's paying you, I'll double it."
01:00:30.335,01:00:32.463,Is that a yes?
01:00:32.504,01:00:34.672,Sorry.
01:00:35.715,01:00:39.136,You... free... us.
01:00:39.177,01:00:42.806,We give you... many fishes.
01:00:42.847,01:00:44.724,Om-nom-nom-nom-nom.
01:00:47.561,01:00:48.645,What is that?
01:00:55.235,01:00:58.113,"Oh, great."
01:00:58.155,01:01:00.240,CORPORAL: I don't want to die all squishy!
01:01:03.660,01:01:04.786,We're dead! Dead!
01:01:04.828,01:01:06.663,Dead! Dead!
01:01:06.704,01:01:09.374,"Oh, no, we're dead!"
01:01:09.416,01:01:11.418,Dead!
01:01:11.460,01:01:15.255,Dead...!
01:01:15.297,01:01:18.049,I pushed a button.
01:01:18.091,01:01:20.344,"Well done, Private!"
01:01:20.385,01:01:22.346,"Good work, malinki."
01:01:22.387,01:01:24.348,Yay. Yes. Yes.
01:01:24.389,01:01:27.184,Um... excellent button-pushing. Hmm.
01:01:27.225,01:01:28.560,"Compliment, praise, et cetera."
01:01:28.602,01:01:32.272,"All right, agents, we are back in business."
01:01:36.026,01:01:40.572,"Wait! Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, all those penguins, they're this way!"
01:01:40.614,01:01:42.157,And so is a massive army of octopi.
01:01:42.199,01:01:50.374,"And as soon as we return to the North Wind headquarters, grab fresh equipment, and work up a smashing new plan, we'll come speeding back and take down Dave."
01:01:50.415,01:01:52.042,But the penguins are in danger!
01:01:52.083,01:01:53.502,We have to go now!
01:01:53.544,01:01:56.171,"Again, huge army of octopi."
01:01:56.213,01:01:58.882,"So, because you failed once, you're just running away?"
01:01:58.923,01:02:00.467,We did not fail.
01:02:00.509,01:02:02.469,And we are not running away.
01:02:02.511,01:02:04.638,We're just very sensibly regrouping.
01:02:04.680,01:02:05.889,Skipper wouldn't care.
01:02:05.930,01:02:09.309,"Plan or no, fancy equipment or no..."
01:02:09.351,01:02:11.603,he'd never leave a man behind.
01:02:11.645,01:02:15.190,"Well, I suppose we can't all be penguins, can we?"
01:02:20.904,01:02:22.280,No.
01:02:23.490,01:02:25.367,But maybe you should be.
01:02:32.916,01:02:34.876,Come on.
01:02:43.510,01:02:45.053,"Showtime, everyone!"
01:02:45.095,01:02:47.598,Big smiles for the Big Apple!
01:02:47.639,01:02:48.765,"Listen up, Doris!"
01:02:48.806,01:02:52.477,"You turn us into freaks, and then what?"
01:02:52.519,01:02:55.606,You think that's gonna make everybody love you?
01:02:55.647,01:02:58.400,"No, but they'll despise you."
01:03:02.362,01:03:05.823,And I'm sure gonna love that.
01:03:14.249,01:03:15.500,REPORTER: Breaking news!
01:03:15.542,01:03:17.502,The missing penguins have been found!
01:03:17.544,01:03:24.342,"Okay. According to my notes, genetic researcher Dr. Octavius Brine has found the penguins and is bringing them here to New York's Battery Park."
01:03:24.384,01:03:26.177,The penguins are coming back!
01:03:26.219,01:03:27.845,"Oh, my gosh! Look!"
01:03:55.081,01:03:59.461,"Penguin lovers of the world, guess who I found."
01:03:59.503,01:04:01.463,Penguins! Penguins!
01:04:01.505,01:04:08.386,"It wasn't easy, but seeing the penguins get what they deserve will make it all worthwhile."
01:04:08.428,01:04:10.096,What a weird thing to say!
01:04:10.138,01:04:11.097,I'm so excited!
01:04:12.307,01:04:13.183,Do it.
01:04:25.945,01:04:28.072,Skipper! Skipper! Skipper!
01:04:28.114,01:04:29.324,Rico! Kowalski!
01:04:29.366,01:04:31.159,I'm up here! Up here!
01:04:29.366,01:04:33.411,It's like I can still hear his little voice calling to us.
01:04:33.453,01:04:35.372,You have to get out of there!
01:04:35.413,01:04:36.373,Move!
01:04:36.414,01:04:38.458,"You have a great otter, there."
01:04:38.500,01:04:39.668,Moo.
01:04:39.710,01:04:41.002,Why would he moo?
01:04:41.044,01:04:42.337,What are you asking me for?
01:04:42.379,01:04:45.340,I'm not Private's little ghost.
01:04:46.966,01:04:48.301,Uh-oh.
01:04:50.136,01:04:51.971,No!
01:04:54.098,01:04:57.435,Are you ready?!
01:04:57.477,01:04:58.478,Yeah!
01:05:00.564,01:05:03.191,Yay...!
01:05:07.445,01:05:09.698,Your new...
01:05:09.740,01:05:11.115,and improved...
01:05:11.157,01:05:13.618,penguins!
01:05:13.660,01:05:16.037,Penguins! Penguins!
01:05:23.712,01:05:25.129,Wha...?
01:05:34.514,01:05:36.140,"Oh, the people love you."
01:05:36.182,01:05:37.642,Just go give them a hug.
01:05:47.527,01:05:48.570,Don't let them touch you!
01:05:57.454,01:05:58.663,"Oh, no."
01:05:58.705,01:06:00.081,What's happening?
01:06:00.123,01:06:01.999,Nobody likes you anymore?
01:06:02.041,01:06:04.168,"Well, the fun and games are just beginning."
01:06:04.210,01:06:05.670,"Watch this, penguins."
01:06:05.712,01:06:06.963,Somebody call...
01:06:07.004,01:06:08.632,the exterminators!
01:06:17.557,01:06:22.813,"And when the exterminators take you away, you never come back."
01:06:46.670,01:06:48.505,"Oh, dear."
01:06:48.546,01:06:50.715,"Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no."
01:06:50.757,01:06:52.175,What do I do? What do I do?
01:06:53.384,01:06:54.344,Crikey!
01:06:59.432,01:07:01.392,"Come on, then. You want to go?"
01:07:01.434,01:07:03.019,You want some argy-bargy?
01:07:23.456,01:07:26.083,Yee-haw!
01:07:26.125,01:07:27.377,Ow.
01:07:28.419,01:07:30.005,"Uh-oh, missed one."
01:07:31.840,01:07:34.009,What a wonderful day in the park.
01:07:34.050,01:07:35.051,Skipper!
01:07:40.390,01:07:41.725,Wait!
01:07:43.100,01:07:44.435,Hold on!
01:07:44.477,01:07:45.520,What are you doing?!
01:07:48.648,01:07:49.607,Skipper!
01:07:49.649,01:07:50.775,Huh?
01:07:54.237,01:07:55.655,"Skipper, listen."
01:07:55.697,01:07:57.407,"It's me, Private."
01:07:57.448,01:07:59.367,"I've got a plan, but I need your help."
01:07:59.409,01:08:01.912,I need my Skipper.
01:08:08.668,01:08:09.544,Huh?
01:08:23.975,01:08:25.142,Private?
01:08:25.184,01:08:26.644,Yes. That's it.
01:08:26.686,01:08:28.521,"Private, you're alive!"
01:08:30.231,01:08:32.316,"Oh, God!"
01:08:39.699,01:08:41.576,Oh!
01:08:45.663,01:08:46.623,Kowalski!
01:08:46.664,01:08:47.624,You've got to get a grip!
01:08:49.250,01:08:51.836,"Kowalski, Eva is worried about you."
01:08:51.878,01:08:53.337,She is?
01:08:53.379,01:08:54.505,Wh-What did she say?
01:08:54.547,01:08:56.257,Did she say my name specifically?
01:08:56.299,01:08:58.175,"I mean, were there..."
01:08:58.217,01:09:00.011,"Details, come on, tell me!"
01:09:00.053,01:09:01.846,Private! You're alive.
01:09:01.888,01:09:03.264,Come here.
01:09:03.306,01:09:06.309,"This feels a little awkward, but I'm happy."
01:09:09.813,01:09:10.981,SKIPPER: Rico!
01:09:11.022,01:09:12.983,You need to listen to us.
01:09:13.024,01:09:15.693,I guess you're kind of the same either way.
01:09:15.735,01:09:16.820,Private!
01:09:16.861,01:09:18.655,Heads up!
01:09:18.696,01:09:21.157,DAVE: Whee-hee!
01:09:21.198,01:09:24.243,"Looks like we're back in business, boys."
01:09:24.285,01:09:27.204,And our business is saving penguin-kind.
01:09:27.246,01:09:29.124,Who's with me?
01:09:29.165,01:09:30.125,Count me in.
01:09:30.166,01:09:31.876,Let's do this!
01:09:31.918,01:09:34.211,Yeah!
01:09:39.425,01:09:41.761,"Sir, how long do we stand here like this?"
01:09:41.803,01:09:44.806,Until we've reached maximum coolness.
01:09:47.934,01:09:49.310,There it is.
01:09:49.352,01:09:51.021,Now all we need is a plan.
01:09:51.062,01:09:52.814,I've got one.
01:09:56.400,01:09:58.486,You stole Dave's ray?
01:09:58.528,01:10:03.950,"Well, I figured if we could reverse the ray, we could turn everyone back to normal."
01:10:03.992,01:10:05.952,Reverse the ray?
01:10:05.994,01:10:06.953,That's brilliant!
01:10:06.995,01:10:08.371,But... it's impossible!
01:10:08.412,01:10:15.586,"In order to reverse the ray, we would need to replace the Medusa Serum with a power source of almost immeasurable cuteness."
01:10:15.628,01:10:17.421,Immeasurable cuteness?
01:10:17.463,01:10:19.799,Where the heck are we supposed to get that?
01:10:30.894,01:10:32.603,"No, wait."
01:10:32.645,01:10:35.272,We don't know what that will do to you! Aah!
01:10:36.983,01:10:38.442,All right!
01:10:38.484,01:10:40.987,The ray!
01:10:41.029,01:10:42.947,Private! Are you okay?
01:10:42.989,01:10:44.199,Yes!
01:10:44.240,01:10:46.617,Yah!
01:10:46.659,01:10:48.119,There's a hand attached to his butt.
01:10:48.161,01:10:49.245,That was not...
01:10:49.286,01:10:50.371,that was not there before.
01:10:50.413,01:10:51.414,Get out of there!
01:10:51.455,01:10:52.415,That's an order!
01:10:52.456,01:10:53.541,Permission to defy order.
01:10:53.583,01:10:54.542,Permission denied!
01:10:54.584,01:10:55.835,Then I deny your denial.
01:10:55.877,01:10:57.253,"It's too risky, Private."
01:10:57.294,01:10:59.422,It already made you sprout a butt-hand!
01:10:59.463,01:11:01.716,I know it has to be me this time.
01:11:03.218,01:11:06.096,"And I think you know it, too."
01:11:19.567,01:11:21.986,I'm the secret weapon.
01:11:31.454,01:11:33.372,I'm happy...
01:11:33.414,01:11:35.666,and yet...
01:11:35.708,01:11:45.009,"now that I have my revenge, I feel... empty, as if what I needed all along was..."
01:11:45.051,01:11:46.803,more revenge!
01:11:46.844,01:11:51.224,"In fact-- Robin, write this down-- tomorrow we move on to kittens!"
01:11:51.266,01:11:58.148,"Then puppies, bunnies, Charlize, they're on the ray!"
01:11:59.899,01:12:01.734,"Helen, hunt them down!"
01:12:01.776,01:12:03.111,"William, hurt them."
01:12:03.153,01:12:04.361,"Halle, bury them!"
01:12:04.403,01:12:07.031,"Hugh, Jack, man the battle stations!"
01:12:07.073,01:12:08.658,"Kevin, bake on!"
01:12:08.699,01:12:11.452,We're still gonna need that victory cake!
01:12:19.294,01:12:21.587,"We're only gonna get one shot at this, boys!"
01:12:21.629,01:12:23.547,How we doing on those snow globes?
01:12:23.589,01:12:26.050,Beam splitter ready!
01:12:26.092,01:12:27.384,Fire at will!
01:12:28.511,01:12:29.595,"Do it, Skipper!"
01:12:42.275,01:12:43.609,Dead batteries?!
01:12:43.651,01:12:45.402,"over, Skipper!"
01:12:45.444,01:12:47.322,Ha-ha!
01:12:47.363,01:12:48.489,No!
01:12:49.615,01:12:51.242,"Rico, batteries!"
01:12:51.284,01:12:52.576,Skipper!
01:12:52.618,01:12:54.162,Hold off those octopi!
01:12:54.204,01:12:55.955,We're doing this now!
01:12:57.123,01:13:00.126,You heard Private!
01:13:17.643,01:13:20.521,"Get back, you aquatic savages!"
01:13:20.563,01:13:23.316,PRIVATE: Behind you! Beside you!
01:13:23.358,01:13:24.775,Hmm...
01:13:27.904,01:13:29.488,PRIVATE: They're coming from every direction!
01:13:29.530,01:13:31.157,There's just too many of them!
01:13:51.928,01:13:53.137,Whoa.
01:13:53.179,01:13:54.180,You came back!
01:14:03.106,01:14:06.567,SHORT FUSE: Oh... that's why you look back at the explosion.
01:14:14.992,01:14:24.043,RICO: Fallback positions!
01:14:24.085,01:14:25.336,Stay away from Private!
01:14:29.715,01:14:32.302,"Suck it up, Kowalski."
01:14:32.343,01:14:33.469,Aha!
01:14:34.804,01:14:35.805,No!
01:14:35.846,01:14:38.057,"It's over, Skipper."
01:14:38.099,01:14:39.350,Over? That's weird.
01:14:39.392,01:14:43.646,Then why is Rico throwing me a fresh pair of double-A's?
01:14:47.942,01:14:50.027,No! The remote!
01:14:58.369,01:14:59.495,Rico! Dibble me!
01:15:22.768,01:15:24.437,Hi-yah!
01:15:57.011,01:15:58.346,It worked!
01:15:58.388,01:15:59.847,Private!
01:15:59.889,01:16:01.265,SKIPPER: Excuse me. Emergency.
01:16:01.307,01:16:02.475,Coming through.
01:16:02.517,01:16:04.310,Make a hole!
01:16:09.065,01:16:13.194,"KOWALSKI: Don't worry, uh... a-a chrysalis is just forming around you."
01:16:13.236,01:16:16.280,That's perfectly normal.
01:16:27.458,01:16:29.126,Private.
01:16:30.420,01:16:31.504,Huh?
01:16:31.546,01:16:32.505,Huh?
01:16:37.218,01:16:39.470,Private?
01:16:43.933,01:16:46.185,Oh! Look at that!
01:16:46.227,01:16:47.644,Hello.
01:16:47.686,01:16:48.729,Private!
01:16:48.771,01:16:50.356,Oh! Hey!
01:16:50.398,01:16:51.566,What's wrong? What are you...
01:16:51.607,01:16:52.858,"Whoa, now."
01:16:52.900,01:16:54.569,"Okay, looking up."
01:16:54.610,01:16:56.070,Is there a... thing?
01:16:58.030,01:16:59.198,how do I look?
01:17:00.366,01:17:04.703,You're hideously disfigured and will probably be hunted for sport.
01:17:04.745,01:17:05.704,Wh-Wha...?
01:17:05.746,01:17:07.206,What?
01:17:07.248,01:17:15.381,If there's anything we've learned from this delightful adventure-- Kowalski-- it's that looks don't matter.
01:17:15.423,01:17:18.301,It's what you do that counts.
01:17:19.427,01:17:22.221,And look at what you did.
01:17:42.408,01:17:44.410,"Yes, sir..."
01:17:44.452,01:17:49.123,you are the most meaningful and valued member of this team.
01:18:07.266,01:18:09.644,"Way to go, Private!"
01:18:11.312,01:18:12.480,Nicely done.
01:18:12.522,01:18:14.064,"Way to go, Private!"
01:18:14.106,01:18:18.194,You did it!
01:18:18.235,01:18:21.614,You saved us!
01:18:21.656,01:18:24.575,"Yeah, we love you!"
01:18:33.750,01:18:34.710,Huh?
01:18:45.429,01:18:46.472,Ramirez!
01:18:46.514,01:18:48.057,Dave.
01:18:52.478,01:18:53.937,Ooh!
01:18:53.979,01:18:57.608,What? Are you kidding me?!
01:18:57.650,01:19:00.152,"Dave. Oh-ho, look at you."
01:19:00.194,01:19:01.862,You think this is over?
01:19:01.904,01:19:04.114,I'm just getting started.
01:19:04.156,01:19:05.908,What do we do with him now?
01:19:05.949,01:19:07.326,GIRL: Aw...
01:19:07.368,01:19:08.994,DAVE: Open this right now!
01:19:09.036,01:19:10.580,"Here you go, kid."
01:19:12.915,01:19:14.833,Cool!
01:19:20.839,01:19:22.883,"I hope you find happiness, Dave."
01:19:22.925,01:19:26.053,It's snowing! It's snowing!
01:19:26.095,01:19:29.473,It's snowing! It's snowing...
01:19:29.515,01:19:31.767,"Right, now, then..."
01:19:31.808,01:19:34.853,"uh, um, this is difficult for me to say."
01:19:34.895,01:19:36.146,Is it osteoporosis?
01:19:36.188,01:19:38.065,You just got to lean into the vowel.
01:19:38.107,01:19:39.483,Os-teo...
01:19:39.525,01:19:41.652,poro...
01:19:41.694,01:19:43.320,I want to say...
01:19:43.362,01:19:46.323,you four are the bravest agents I've ever known.
01:19:46.365,01:19:48.825,The point is...
01:19:48.867,01:19:52.288,"I was wrong about you, and I hope..."
01:19:52.329,01:19:54.749,there's some way I can make it right.
01:19:54.790,01:19:56.459,Give us jet packs.
01:19:56.500,01:19:58.085,Whoa. Uh...
01:19:58.127,01:20:00.337,Did... did you just say...
01:20:04.800,01:20:07.136,"Well, that feels right!"
01:20:07.177,01:20:09.430,"I think I'd actually prefer a jet pack, please."
01:20:09.472,01:20:13.434,Ooh. I think we should go with Private's idea.
01:20:13.476,01:20:15.269,Mm.
01:20:15.311,01:20:17.980,Yeah!
01:20:18.021,01:20:20.065,Kowalski! What's our trajectory?
01:20:20.107,01:20:23.110,95% certain this will end in massive...
01:20:23.152,01:20:25.028,flaming disaster!
01:20:25.070,01:20:28.031,And the other five percent?
01:20:28.073,01:20:30.117,Jet packs are awesome!
01:20:30.159,01:20:31.160,SKIPPER: Agreed!
01:20:41.211,01:20:43.673,Who says penguins can't fly?
01:20:48.385,01:20:50.053,SKIPPER: Boo-hah!
01:21:25.922,01:21:29.426,"PRIVATE: Um, Skipper, we are going to turn me back to normal, right?"
01:21:29.468,01:21:31.261,SKIPPER: Absolutely.
01:21:34.890,01:21:37.476,Whee! I'm in a rocket ship!
01:21:37.518,01:21:38.644,I want to push the button.
01:21:38.686,01:21:41.605,Give me that!
01:21:41.647,01:21:43.273,Let's do this!
01:21:43.315,01:21:44.692,"Okay, on three."
01:21:44.734,01:21:45.693,Ow!
01:21:45.735,01:21:48.028,I'm just gonna do a little practice push. Aah!
01:21:48.070,01:21:52.908,"Okay, I'm not going to press it. Why are you smacking my hand?"
01:21:52.949,01:21:54.951,I'm a laser show.
01:21:55.870,01:21:57.120,Julien!
01:21:58.706,01:22:01.291,Hey!
01:22:01.333,01:22:02.710,High one!
01:22:02.752,01:22:06.797,"Immeasurable cuteness, right there!"
01:22:06.839,01:22:09.966,I feel like a French fry!
01:22:10.008,01:22:11.635,Whoa! I'm okay!
01:22:11.677,01:22:14.054,And with cuteness to spare!
01:22:14.096,01:22:17.767,Come on! Frosty mugs of herring juice all around!
01:22:17.808,01:22:18.975,SKIPPER: Private's buying.
01:22:19.017,01:22:22.772,"You know, if I'm being honest, I expected a little more..."
01:22:24.607,01:22:28.569,"Now, that's pizzazz!"
