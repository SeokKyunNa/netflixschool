00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:25.455  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.373  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

When I went in to see him
the next morning, we got in his office,

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.546  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
as soon as I sat down,
he said, "What's been going on?"

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.548  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.926  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have to say,
that's what we call an honest relapse.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:42.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

I can work with you.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:49.437  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
'Cause I can't tell you how many people
relapse and try to lie about it,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.398  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
figuring it's just easier to lie about it,
and it never is.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.776  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
They found her body in a cornfield
about 40 minutes from here,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.153  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
but she was a Huntington girl.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:24.115  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It had just said, basically,
a prostitute was found in a cornfield

88
00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:27.327  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.664  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.506  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
