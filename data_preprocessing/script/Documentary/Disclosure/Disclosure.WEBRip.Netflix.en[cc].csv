00:00:14.848,00:00:20.603,"Do you know that feeling when you're sitting in a movie theater, and everyone's laughing at something, and you just don't get it?"
00:00:25.942,00:00:28.445,I hate everyone else in the world but you.
00:00:30.947,00:00:32.907,where trans people would be celebrated...
00:00:34.701,00:00:36.453,...on or off the screen.
00:00:36.536,00:00:39.581,"Thank you, thank you so much for this moment."
00:00:43.460,00:00:45.253,How do you hide your penis?
00:00:48.798,00:00:53.678,"You kept it quiet because, you said, you didn't want to become othered."
00:00:59.184,00:01:00.894,"in government, in media."
00:01:06.399,00:01:07.317,for other people.
00:01:07.400,00:01:08.526,You never know.
00:01:13.656,00:01:15.742,of their own storytelling.
00:01:17.243,00:01:20.455,"we're talking, really, about unprecedented trans visibility."
00:01:20.538,00:01:22.582,That's my sister!
00:01:23.208,00:01:26.836,"Trans people are being murdered disproportionately, still."
00:01:32.759,00:01:36.971,"the more we are seen, the more we are violated."
00:01:41.267,00:01:46.272,"the more confidence the community gains, which then puts us in more danger."
00:01:49.150,00:01:50.652,then I've committed a crime.
00:01:50.735,00:01:54.572,"If I go in the men's restroom, then everybody knows."
00:01:58.493,00:02:00.078,"have had those moments of being, like..."
00:02:00.161,00:02:04.874,is this going to somehow alienate people who aren't ready yet?
00:02:08.837,00:02:13.007,"have become, like, a front and center issue in the culture wars?"
00:02:16.511,00:02:24.435,"is what has landed us in this moment right now, and you have hope on one side and fear on the other."
00:02:27.772,00:02:40.451,"the ways in which trans people have been represented on-screen have suggested that we're not real, have suggested that we're mentally ill, that we don't exist."
00:02:40.535,00:02:42.829,"And yet, here I am."
00:02:42.912,00:02:45.373,"Yet here we are, and we've always been here."
00:02:56.509,00:02:57.635,"Hit it, maestro."
00:03:12.692,00:03:31.794,"and then having my first interactions with what it meant to be transgender happening on television, is that even when characters weren't necessarily trans identified, I think those characters affected how I thought of myself as a trans person and how the general public probably thinks about trans people."
00:03:38.176,00:03:41.971,was the character of Geraldine from The Flip Wilson Show.
00:03:47.310,00:03:48.561,"Sing the song, Ray!"
00:03:56.527,00:04:03.409,"and my mother loved Geraldine and would laugh at that character, so it was something that existed in the realm of humor."
00:04:03.826,00:04:09.624,But whenever there was something trans this or sex change that...
00:04:13.211,00:04:15.713,-A sex change operation! -Right.
00:04:16.381,00:04:17.340,I'd better sit down.
00:04:19.050,00:04:24.013,"...I would be very interested, and I would sort of lean in, but very, sort of, discreetly."
00:04:29.519,00:04:37.318,I think one of the first trans representations I saw in a fictional context was that episode of The Jeffersons with Edie Stokes.
00:04:38.152,00:04:41.030,"It's me, Eddie. Only I'm Edie now."
00:04:42.323,00:04:43.157,Say what?
00:04:51.165,00:04:52.625,Take a good look.
00:05:01.301,00:05:05.763,"to say that he was Edie to, sort of, let Weezie know that he wasn't cheating."
00:05:15.315,00:05:19.110,and the same bullying that I was experiencing at school.
00:05:23.448,00:05:35.710,"You know, I went to church every Sunday and was a straight A student, and I won talent shows I did."
00:05:35.793,00:05:43.092,"So, that was, like, who I was, and my mom wanted me to be successful, and I was being groomed to be successful, and then I'd turn on the television and I'd see..."
00:05:45.970,00:05:51.059,"...these images that don't seem to comport with, like, the person that I knew I was."
00:05:54.395,00:05:58.024,"And so, everything that was trans about me, it made me just hate."
00:05:58.107,00:05:59.817,I... I have to leave.
00:06:02.612,00:06:03.446,I'm gonna go.
00:06:05.823,00:06:14.707,"As a trans person, you have the most sensitive radar to tell the difference between you're laughing with us..."
00:06:15.124,00:06:18.628,"In the phone book, you were listed as F. Deveau."
00:06:25.009,00:06:26.677,...or you're laughing at us.
00:06:27.345,00:06:28.638,This is the men's room.
00:06:33.518,00:06:35.061,Trans jokes? Really?
00:06:35.645,00:06:37.563,"Hello, Joel. I'm Jackie."
00:06:40.358,00:06:42.110,We've had to have a good sense of humor.
00:06:44.821,00:06:47.698,"I told you, it's called an unclassified misdemeanor."
00:06:47.782,00:06:49.992,But we don't want to be the butt of jokes.
00:06:53.496,00:06:55.081,"-Wait a minute, I forgot something. -What?"
00:06:57.333,00:06:59.001,That's awful. Can't you do better than that?
00:07:00.002,00:07:06.884,Every trans person carries within themself a history of trans representation just in terms of what they've seen themselves.
00:07:09.053,00:07:10.054,Coop.
00:07:12.682,00:07:13.808,Dennis?
00:07:16.310,00:07:18.855,"Why don't you live with me, and I'll be your wife?"
00:07:23.151,00:07:30.825,"is a sense of a broader history of that representation, so that they can, kind of, find themselves in it."
00:07:35.455,00:07:43.171,I think it's just fascinating that some of the earliest moving images were cross-dressed images.
00:07:50.094,00:07:55.808,"When you watch, it very much feels like womanhood is silly and is to be mocked."
00:07:58.769,00:08:10.156,"When you think about the time, that time historically, cross-dressing was illegal, so that someone who decided to transgress gender expectations in real life was often harassed and arrested."
00:08:19.707,00:08:23.044,"we've been around since there was, uh, footage."
00:08:23.127,00:08:24.629,You just have to look for us.
00:08:32.678,00:08:36.516,with inventing what's called the dynamic montage.
00:08:38.226,00:08:49.111,"And that was a D. W. Griffith film, and the story is of Judith of Bethulia, who's a good Jewish woman who lives in Jerusalem, then the invading army is coming."
00:08:51.239,00:08:59.163,"And Judith, to save the city, pretends to be a concubine of Holofernes, the general."
00:09:00.164,00:09:06.837,"And while she is in his tent, she takes a sword and cuts his head off."
00:09:08.005,00:09:16.764,There's a claim that this is one of the first films that we know of where the cut in the film is used to advance the story.
00:09:18.891,00:09:29.026,"And there's a kind of, like, trans or, you know, gender non-binary character who is kind of circulating around the cut in the narrative."
00:09:31.487,00:09:40.871,"It's almost like the figure of the cut trans body, the eunuch who's been castrated or emasculated, who is a cut figure, presides over..."
00:09:42.039,00:09:44.417,the invention of the cinematic cut.
00:09:46.711,00:09:49.463,It's like trans and cinema have grown up together.
00:09:49.547,00:09:56.470,"It's like we have always been present on-screen, and it's not just coincidental."
00:09:56.554,00:09:59.307,"I mean, there's something really deeply connected."
00:10:02.018,00:10:05.062,Can we all just talk about D. W. Griffith for a minute?
00:10:09.775,00:10:12.820,"As the Missy Elliott song would say, we need to just back it up for a minute."
00:10:15.114,00:10:22.788,The fact that we study and teach D. W. Griffith without saying a word about the representation...
00:10:23.164,00:10:25.416,"Like, I'm glad I didn't go to film school."
00:10:27.043,00:10:36.927,"Because if I had seen Birth of a Nation, when they got to that blackface moment, when this guy springs up from behind a bush wanting to rape the white woman, I..."
00:10:37.303,00:10:39.722,That would have been it for me at... at film school.
00:10:39.805,00:10:41.682,Right? That... that would have been my last day.
00:10:42.767,00:10:56.280,"Not only is D. W. Griffith incredibly racist, but he understands that you can turn gender-nonconforming people into the joke of your story."
00:10:57.406,00:11:05.790,"It's like, Oh, yeah, great, D. W. Griffith, you, you know, racist piece of shit, you... you've invented this stereotype in film. Well done."
00:11:12.546,00:11:24.058,"A Florida Enchantment, it foregrounds questions of gender change and using blackface while you're using gendered cross-dressing."
00:11:24.141,00:11:31.232,"You know, just, like, it's these sort of twin fascinations that, you know, they're always sort of tangled up with each other somehow."
00:11:35.820,00:11:38.197,"You know, in terms of transmasculine experience."
00:11:38.280,00:11:41.492,"Like, you know, first, there's no such vocabulary back in the day of..."
00:11:41.575,00:11:42.827,of trans anything.
00:11:44.453,00:11:48.416,"In A Florida Enchantment she eats a seed, and then, like, voil√†, she... she wakes up, she's a man."
00:11:48.499,00:11:55.840,"And, you know, not only were we looking at gender expression, but at also the racist expectations."
00:11:56.507,00:12:05.099,"So, the white person becomes this high-society dandy, like the ideal of what a man should be, but then her handmaid is forced to take the seed."
00:12:06.183,00:12:08.769,She becomes this aggressive valet who's violent.
00:12:09.603,00:12:19.864,"And so, even in this gender-transgressive fantasy, you still have white characters in blackface playing these horribly fantastical versions of Black people."
00:12:26.620,00:12:29.123,"that feel like an assault, I think."
00:12:31.375,00:12:34.295,But I think we have to know them. I think we have to learn them.
00:12:44.096,00:12:46.056,...in that needing to be a rite of passage.
00:12:46.474,00:12:48.851,Your daddy would want you in this. Try this bitch on.
00:12:50.478,00:12:52.688,"-I ain't gonna be able to do it, Foxx. -Okay."
00:12:53.022,00:12:56.358,"Well, I guess you'll just remain the, uh, mid-level comedian, just..."
00:12:56.567,00:12:58.944,"killin' them in the club in the hood, but, uh..."
00:12:59.361,00:13:01.405,white folk ain't gonna know who the fuck you are.
00:13:01.822,00:13:02.948,So be it.
00:13:10.623,00:13:13.834,...and almost predatory in relationship to white womanhood.
00:13:13.918,00:13:15.336,Take your hands off the white lady.
00:13:15.419,00:13:18.088,And there is a history of emasculating Black men in this country.
00:13:18.172,00:13:23.803,"Like, a literal history, during slavery and during Jim Crow, when Black men were lynched, often their genitalia was cut off."
00:13:23.886,00:13:28.265,"And so, a Black man donning a dress is this emasculating thing."
00:13:28.349,00:13:29.725,"Oh, no. Wait."
00:13:33.687,00:13:42.112,that a lot of Black people have had to me is about that legacy of trauma ...the historic emasculation of Black men in America.
00:13:47.952,00:13:49.245,takes away the threat.
00:13:49.328,00:13:51.038,"Oh, we can laugh now."
00:13:53.582,00:14:05.094,"I can't think... I can't even tell you how many times I've been in public space, particularly early in my transition, in New York City, where pe-- when I would walk into a subway car, and people would just burst into laughter."
00:14:05.177,00:14:10.724,As if my existence on that subway car was just a joke.
00:14:10.808,00:14:15.604,And I think people are-- have been trained to have that reaction.
00:14:19.900,00:14:21.819,"Hi, Al. It's me, Thad."
00:14:24.697,00:14:27.157,"If I'm not laughing, is it a joke, you know?"
00:14:29.702,00:14:38.460,"It lends itself to this idea that we're just comedy, that we're just some kind of freaks, that we just playin' dress up in order to make other people laugh."
00:14:38.544,00:14:39.378,Ooh!
00:14:47.303,00:14:49.013,"in order to get a job, in Tootsie..."
00:14:49.096,00:14:50.222,"I'm Edward, Kimberly."
00:14:54.184,00:14:55.394,"Now, just watch me work."
00:15:00.482,00:15:01.317,Hello.
00:15:01.984,00:15:02.860,Hello.
00:15:04.194,00:15:07.740,"For me, as a child in the '60s..."
00:15:10.242,00:15:13.078,...I didn't know what trans was.
00:15:21.795,00:15:24.423,when I spent time with my brother and my father...
00:15:24.798,00:15:25.633,Oh!
00:15:28.969,00:15:30.638,"The Three Stooges, really?"
00:15:31.513,00:15:32.389,I'm a Lucy girl.
00:15:34.725,00:15:39.813,"So, naturally, when I saw film and television, I identified with the heroine."
00:15:42.149,00:15:57.206,"When you're this queer kid in the suburbs, and you're dying for glamour, and you're watching Dressed To Kill, you don't see the misogyny, you just see beauty in motion and..."
00:15:59.625,00:16:10.469,"And there's this sequence with Angie Dickinson wearing all creams, and she's got her beige Isotoners on, and just looking breathtaking."
00:16:13.472,00:16:16.850,"She sees this hot guy, and she's gonna pick him up."
00:16:16.934,00:16:19.395,She's very unhappy with her husband.
00:16:22.022,00:16:23.857,And then she gets on the elevator...
00:16:25.818,00:16:27.194,and suddenly...
00:16:32.574,00:16:34.243,...in a Shake-N-Go wig...
00:16:39.665,00:16:40.666,Oh...
00:16:40.749,00:16:41.750,No!
00:16:42.251,00:16:43.419,...and murders her.
00:16:46.463,00:16:54.013,"We look at that now, and we say, This is atrocious, but when I was a kid, it was like, I'm Angie Dickinson. That's me."
00:16:54.096,00:16:54.930,That's what...
00:16:55.848,00:16:57.307,I don't know what the fuck.
00:17:00.269,00:17:05.315,"For decades, Hollywood has taught audiences how to react to trans people."
00:17:10.446,00:17:11.864,A goddamn broad?
00:17:11.947,00:17:14.283,"A goddamn ugly broad, Barzell!"
00:17:14.366,00:17:18.162,"And sometimes, they're being taught that the way to react to us is fear."
00:17:23.625,00:17:27.087,"that we're serial killers, that we must be deviants or perverts."
00:17:35.596,00:17:40.017,with people who traverse gender stereotypes being... murderers.
00:17:45.898,00:17:47.357,"What's going on, Alfred?"
00:17:47.900,00:17:48.859,From the grave.
00:17:49.735,00:17:50.778,Talk to us.
00:17:51.904,00:17:55.282,Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?
00:17:55.365,00:17:58.118,Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.
00:17:59.870,00:18:03.248,"Well, it started as a bad joke in Kansas City homicide. They said..."
00:18:04.166,00:18:06.126,This one likes to skin his humps.
00:18:06.627,00:18:08.837,"Okay, I love Silence of the Lambs. I'm sorry."
00:18:08.921,00:18:12.007,"It's a great film, and it's a great book. I know it's problematic."
00:18:20.099,00:18:23.310,There's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence.
00:18:23.393,00:18:24.770,Transsexuals are very passive.
00:18:24.853,00:18:27.314,"It's like, okay, so you get that this is not..."
00:18:28.065,00:18:29.733,"a transsexual, a trans person."
00:18:29.817,00:18:30.692,You get that.
00:18:31.401,00:18:33.278,"Yeah, but we're not passive."
00:18:33.362,00:18:37.199,"Like, why can't you just say we're not psychopathic murderers?"
00:18:37.282,00:18:38.700,We're not serial killers.
00:18:39.451,00:18:41.036,We don't do that shit.
00:18:50.087,00:18:51.839,"Mister, my family'll pay cash."
00:18:51.922,00:18:54.967,"Whatever ransom you're askin' for, they'll pay it."
00:18:57.803,00:19:09.481,"and I worked up the courage to tell one of my colleagues, and she's a very, very smart woman, very, very talented musician, very well-educated, very worldly, and she looked at me and goes, You mean like Buffalo Bill?"
00:19:11.984,00:19:34.798,"Like, her only point of reference was this disgusting, psychotic serial killer who hunts women in order to kill them and skin them in order to wear their bodies, to literally appropriate the female form, which is exactly, like, the feminist, like, argument against the existence of trans women is we're trying to appropriate the female form, and here he was doing it literally, physically."
00:19:37.968,00:19:39.678,"And, you know, she regrets it now."
00:19:39.761,00:19:45.809,"She looks back, and she's horrified that she said that, because she knows trans people now, and she knows the issues, and she knows me."
00:19:46.185,00:19:55.485,"But the fact that that was her only reference point, that that was her only template for understanding, was a sick, psychotic serial killer."
00:19:57.279,00:19:59.406,It hurts. It just hurts.
00:20:12.794,00:20:20.719,"when people would get to know me, one of their questions was, Have you seen M. Butterfly?"
00:20:21.720,00:20:24.223,And I was always just like...
00:20:25.724,00:20:26.600,Ren√©...
00:20:27.643,00:20:29.686,please let me keep my clothes on.
00:20:38.070,00:20:42.741,"But it was just one of those things where you're just like, Why am I being asked about M. Butterfly?"
00:20:43.200,00:20:44.034,Look at me.
00:20:50.082,00:20:53.460,You're looking at the Asian-American trans representation.
00:20:54.044,00:20:55.295,There-- There isn't any.
00:21:00.008,00:21:03.387,don't actually personally know someone who is transgender.
00:21:03.470,00:21:12.312,"So most of the information that Americans get about who transgender people are, what our lives are and are about, comes from the media."
00:21:17.109,00:21:30.956,"We're not raised, usually, in a family where other trans people are around us, so when we're trying to figure out who we are, we look to the media to try to figure it out, because just like the 80 percent of Americans who say they don't know a trans person, that's often true of trans people as well."
00:21:31.039,00:21:36.712,"We don't know a trans person when figuring out who we are, so we're looking to the media, to figure out, like, Who's like us?"
00:21:40.924,00:21:46.305,I was really excited when The L Word said they were gonna bring a transmasculine character onto the show.
00:21:46.388,00:21:50.017,"Trans men were a part of the lesbian community, and it seemed awesome."
00:21:56.815,00:22:00.068,transmasculine character on a television series.
00:22:00.652,00:22:01.862,Are you doing hormones?
00:22:02.654,00:22:03.530,No.
00:22:04.531,00:22:05.449,Not yet.
00:22:06.283,00:22:08.910,"Then, Max starts testosterone."
00:22:09.411,00:22:10.620,"Hey, don't do that."
00:22:10.704,00:22:11.955,-Stop that. -Delete it.
00:22:12.039,00:22:14.541,Don't touch my fucking computer. Stop it.
00:22:14.624,00:22:19.755,Hey! Don't touch-- to a raging a-hole.
00:22:19.838,00:22:22.758,"You're my girlfriend, and this is my party."
00:22:23.633,00:22:25.510,You shouldn't be dancing with some other dude.
00:22:25.594,00:22:28.263,I'm gonna dance with whoever the fuck I wanna dance with.
00:22:28.347,00:22:31.350,"You notice that, like, Oh, yeah, I'm definitely... I'm more frustrated."
00:22:32.392,00:22:33.894,But to that level...
00:22:33.977,00:22:36.772,"It's the testosterone. It, like, amps me up."
00:22:36.855,00:22:38.899,It paints it in a bad light.
00:22:38.982,00:22:42.277,"I feel like, if I didn't work out, I'd wanna break someone's face."
00:22:49.785,00:22:53.413,"...uh, because The L Word is a lesbian show..."
00:22:53.497,00:22:59.961,It just saddens me to see so many of our strong butch girls giving up their womanhood to be a man.
00:23:00.504,00:23:04.591,"...and so, they're looking at trans people through a lesbian lens."
00:23:05.092,00:23:09.888,Why can't you be the butchest butch in the world and keep your body?
00:23:10.555,00:23:12.015,Because I wanna feel whole.
00:23:13.225,00:23:15.727,I want the outside of me to match the inside of me.
00:23:17.521,00:23:19.981,You'll be givin' up the most precious thing in the world.
00:23:21.233,00:23:22.275,"What, my tits?"
00:23:23.443,00:23:25.445,"No, being a woman."
00:23:30.784,00:23:41.128,"the writers and producers of The L Word's approach to Max, is that they are seeing trans men increasingly enter the lesbian community and that they are traitors to feminism."
00:23:41.211,00:23:43.213,Does that mean... Have I got the job?
00:23:43.296,00:23:45.966,"Welcome aboard, Max. Welcome to Intechmode."
00:23:46.049,00:23:47.426,"Wow. Thanks, man."
00:23:49.261,00:23:50.637,"Whoa, that's exciting."
00:23:51.138,00:23:52.889,We're supposed to root against Max.
00:23:53.890,00:23:57.436,Are you gonna sell out and start sleeping with the enemy?
00:24:00.105,00:24:01.356,is a part of our history.
00:24:02.149,00:24:11.074,"What we've learned from it and how we portray trans characters now... from now on has-- is, in a big part, due to Max."
00:24:18.206,00:24:26.047,"We just need more, and that way, the occasional clumsy representation wouldn't matter as much because it wouldn't be all that there is."
00:24:26.506,00:24:28.633,You wanna know about my childhood? Okay.
00:24:28.717,00:24:30.135,"I had no friends, all right?"
00:24:30.218,00:24:32.846,I wore too much makeup. All the kids around me thought I was evil.
00:24:32.929,00:24:34.431,Now look at me! Nurse Nan.
00:24:34.514,00:24:36.600,"David, I cannot be the villain forever."
00:24:36.683,00:24:40.729,My family and I would always watch movies together.
00:24:45.317,00:24:50.238,"This is Dr. Franz Blau of the sex-change clinic in Bethesda, Maryland."
00:24:50.322,00:24:52.449,...but once we got to the end...
00:24:52.532,00:24:56.745,"Before she came to our little clinic, she was..."
00:24:57.704,00:25:01.416,"Milton Moorehead of Syosset, Long Island."
00:25:01.791,00:25:02.626,Hello.
00:25:07.672,00:25:11.551,...my family got really quiet...
00:25:16.973,00:25:19.893,that if I chose a certain life...
00:25:20.310,00:25:21.478,She's a boy.
00:25:24.606,00:25:26.149,"Yeah, well we knew that."
00:25:28.235,00:25:29.694,I wouldn't be loved.
00:25:31.696,00:25:34.241,"I was seven or eight at the time, and..."
00:25:40.914,00:25:44.793,"And we never really talked about it after that, but..."
00:25:47.546,00:25:50.549,"I remember the next day, my mom would try to..."
00:25:51.049,00:25:55.136,get me to wear more masculine clothes.
00:26:00.141,00:26:01.518,"Tell me, lady!"
00:26:04.604,00:26:05.981,It's an accident.
00:26:06.064,00:26:08.066,"If I had the courage, I'd cut it off."
00:26:08.149,00:26:09.484,You'd still be a man.
00:26:09.568,00:26:10.902,-A man! -No!
00:26:14.322,00:26:19.286,most of the film and television is not made with you in mind.
00:26:19.703,00:26:33.341,"And so, if you are a person of color, an LGBTQ person, a person who's an immigrant, um, a person with a disability, you develop a critical awareness because you understand that the images that you're seeing are not your life."
00:26:34.801,00:26:36.052,"Forgive me, Papa."
00:26:40.765,00:26:41.600,Wait!
00:26:43.935,00:26:48.982,"I giggle 'cause it's like, I'm a Black trans girl from Alabama, and, like, I live for Yentl."
00:26:49.065,00:26:50.066,Um...
00:26:53.445,00:26:55.113,Welcome to our yeshiva.
00:26:56.072,00:26:56.906,I'm accepted?
00:27:00.160,00:27:06.875,"to be seen for who I was, but needing to fit in in a traditional way, to, sort of, get by at the time."
00:27:06.958,00:27:10.795,"I mean, the song Will Someone Ever Look At Me That Way? was, like, my jam."
00:27:25.477,00:27:29.522,that no one saw as a girl at the time.
00:27:37.280,00:27:39.032,And also Victor/Victoria.
00:27:39.115,00:27:42.160,A woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman?
00:27:42.243,00:27:44.079,-Ridiculous. -It's-- It's preposterous.
00:27:44.162,00:27:46.498,"In fact, it's so preposterous, no one would ever believe it."
00:27:48.833,00:27:52.504,"and that was the year Yentl came out, Victor/Victoria came out."
00:28:03.807,00:28:05.183,Yay!
00:28:07.060,00:28:12.607,"who want to see our stories reflected back to us, starting with cave paintings to 3D IMAX."
00:28:12.691,00:28:15.694,We want to see ourselves reflected back to us in a story.
00:28:17.987,00:28:19.781,is they've largely been invisible in the media...
00:28:26.079,00:28:29.374,"-My pronouns are they, theirs, and them. -Okay."
00:28:29.457,00:28:37.340,"And certainly, being invisible is a privilege compared to the type of transphobia that has been written into trans women characters."
00:28:37.424,00:28:38.425,I'm a married man.
00:28:38.508,00:28:39.426,So am I.
00:28:42.804,00:28:48.184,"and when they look to the screen to see themselves reflected back, they see almost nothing."
00:28:49.853,00:28:51.104,All right.
00:28:54.399,00:28:56.234,because of To Kill a Mockingbird.
00:29:01.614,00:29:08.288,I resonated with tomboys because I didn't think that there was another option.
00:29:08.371,00:29:11.124,"So I was like, Oh, that's... Yeah, I get that."
00:29:15.628,00:29:21.760,so a lot of what I understood about the world was coming to me through TV and films.
00:29:21.843,00:29:25.138,"Like, Just One Of The Guys was something that would come on TV on Saturdays."
00:29:25.221,00:29:27.766,-Who do you think you are? Tootsie? -No.
00:29:28.433,00:29:29.559,"Okay, Yentl."
00:29:30.268,00:29:31.644,What do you want to be? A rabbi?
00:29:33.980,00:29:35.398,"when I was really, really little."
00:29:35.482,00:29:40.904,"She decides to pretend to be a boy so that, you know, her writing can be taken seriously."
00:29:40.987,00:29:42.822,You're a pretty girl. You could be a model.
00:29:42.906,00:29:43.948,Be a model?
00:29:44.657,00:29:47.452,Why? Because a pretty girl can't possibly have a brain?
00:29:47.535,00:29:53.291,They played with this idea of transness as a way of occupying a space that you necessarily aren't supposed to have.
00:29:59.839,00:30:01.925,"In my imagination, like, That would be... Yes!"
00:30:02.008,00:30:05.011,"New haircut, got some jeans, got the cool backpack."
00:30:05.094,00:30:06.930,All the friends wanna hang out with this cool...
00:30:07.013,00:30:10.517,"But when I fall in love, I better hurry up and become a girl again."
00:30:18.817,00:30:21.528,And all the conflict is coming because of the lie.
00:30:21.611,00:30:22.654,You're gay.
00:30:24.239,00:30:25.448,I'm not gay.
00:30:25.532,00:30:28.117,Instead of just having a conversation...
00:30:30.578,00:30:34.457,"Hey, listen. I gotta tell you, this is what I'm doin', it's like, I have tits."
00:30:35.834,00:30:37.418,Where do you get off having tits?
00:30:42.340,00:30:43.424,"What are you, a demon?"
00:30:50.974,00:30:53.017,why they thought that was the way to go.
00:30:53.101,00:30:54.352,"Come on, blue. Let's play ball."
00:30:58.690,00:31:03.069,"packaged in a transmasculine experience, which is so invalidating."
00:31:05.196,00:31:07.198,He's a goddamn girl.
00:31:09.158,00:31:12.787,I remember specifically seeing the Jerry Springer episode with Reno.
00:31:13.788,00:31:20.211,"Child, Reno was on Jerry Springer, comes out, you know, this beautiful little Black guy."
00:31:20.295,00:31:23.798,"He's out there with his girlfriend. He's like, I got something to tell you."
00:31:25.049,00:31:26.593,I'm a girl.
00:31:30.638,00:31:33.016,It... That just... That blew my mind.
00:31:35.143,00:31:36.603,-This is a girl? -This?
00:31:37.312,00:31:40.273,"What you mean, this? You don't got no reason to disrespect me on this show."
00:31:42.609,00:31:50.199,"someone transmasculine on television, it was the first time, clearly, that I was seeing somebody Black and transmasculine on television."
00:31:50.283,00:31:52.035,"What do you call yourself, a trans...?"
00:31:56.372,00:31:59.250,and in and out of the shelter system.
00:31:59.334,00:32:01.002,I'm couch surfing.
00:32:01.085,00:32:04.839,Typical Black queer trans stuff in New York City.
00:32:05.590,00:32:06.716,And...
00:32:06.799,00:32:17.143,"I don't even believe that someone like me really exists, so to see this image, you know, in front of me on TV, I mean, it-- it really was empowering."
00:32:19.687,00:32:26.653,I think we don't see as much representation of trans men as we do trans women because people don't think trans men are as sensational.
00:32:26.736,00:32:33.660,"I'm a proud trans man, Dr. Bailey, but I like for people to get to know me before they find out my private medical history."
00:32:34.285,00:32:35.119,Of course.
00:32:35.203,00:32:38.748,"I think, also, trans men are not as recognizable."
00:32:45.254,00:32:50.802,or that they don't really exist because people don't visibly see them.
00:32:50.885,00:32:54.263,Testosterone. You can't just pack it up and put it in a drawer.
00:32:56.057,00:32:59.978,"Well, actually, you can, as long as it's not past its expiration date."
00:33:01.437,00:33:16.035,"Trans women vastly outnumber trans men in terms of depictions and portrayals in the media, uh, even though the numbers, the actual numbers, of real trans people are pretty evenly split between men and women, just like with cis people, but we see far more depictions of trans women."
00:33:16.577,00:33:25.336,"And, of course, that's partly because women overall, therefore including trans women, are a more commodifiable asset."
00:33:27.088,00:33:34.721,"I was so viciously harassed on the streets of New York early in my transition, and I would arm myself."
00:33:34.804,00:33:48.484,"It was warpaint, going out into the world and just wanting to feel at my very best because I knew I would be misgendered, I knew that I would immediately feel unsafe just walking down the street, and that was certainly the case."
00:33:48.568,00:33:52.613,"And so, um, I armored myself, and makeup was a way to do that."
00:33:55.825,00:34:21.017,"I think that one woman's armor becomes another woman's adornment in the sense that a kind of Kardashian aesthetic, this hyper-feminine, plump lips, the big hair, the extensions the silicone-injected curves of the body, in some ways, might be a reflection of a change in aesthetics that comes out of the kind of gay men who are often doing the styling for celebrities."
00:34:27.982,00:34:29.901,that they know from the clubs.
00:34:30.318,00:34:40.119,"And for them, it comes out of, ultimately, the sex workers, who have to hyper-feminize their body in order to compete for clients in order to survive."
00:34:45.500,00:34:49.879,"that they learned that men like, you know, from movies and TV, and it kind of creates this ultimate cycle."
00:34:51.297,00:35:13.528,"But a lot of people will look at trans women's performance of femininity and see it as somehow reinforcing the worst patriarchal stereotypes of women, and I think it's really unfair and ahistorical to foist that same perspective on people who are just trying to survive."
00:35:16.197,00:35:19.700,"Cute little old man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy."
00:35:19.784,00:35:23.037,"And if you want a girl, I can be a girl. Hell, I can be whatever you want me to be."
00:35:23.121,00:35:24.122,Really?
00:35:25.414,00:35:29.001,"I've been a prostitute, Prostitute 1, Prostitute 2, call girl, hooker, you know?"
00:35:29.919,00:35:32.588,"This is kind of embarrassing to say, but I'm a virgin too."
00:35:32.672,00:35:35.091,And your friends thought that we might like each other.
00:35:39.470,00:35:42.682,I think... that you are not a virgin.
00:35:43.558,00:35:46.227,And I think you're a prostitute.
00:35:49.313,00:35:51.732,"um, at the same time..."
00:35:53.067,00:35:56.445,"uh, at... at a point, I felt limited."
00:35:56.821,00:35:59.240,"I felt like, Okay, what's next?"
00:35:59.615,00:36:02.410,"Is there anything next, for me personally?"
00:36:02.493,00:36:15.298,"GLAAD took a look at 134 episodes of television where a transgender character was brought on just to be a guest star character, and what we found in those portrayals was that the most common profession shown for a transgender character was sex worker."
00:36:17.884,00:36:19.177,"What, you wanna suck my dick now?"
00:36:19.969,00:36:21.095,What?
00:36:21.179,00:36:22.638,You want me to take mine out?
00:36:23.097,00:36:24.682,You wanna put it in your mouth?
00:36:25.183,00:36:32.690,"It is true that in the real world, many transgender women, particularly, are pushed into sex work because of the employment discrimination that transgender people face."
00:36:32.773,00:36:38.696,"The unemployment rate for transgender people is three times the national average, and four times the national average if you're a trans person of color."
00:36:39.322,00:36:49.999,"So there are contextual and social reasons why some trans women are engaging in sex work, but when it's shown on television, and no explanation is given as to why, because it's just what trans women do."
00:36:50.082,00:36:55.713,"I told him, You better get that thing out of my ass, or I'm gonna shit on it!"
00:36:57.298,00:37:02.678,I... I am paying a fortune to live in a neighborhood that's trendy by day and tranny by night.
00:37:02.762,00:37:04.972,-Tranny? -Transsexuals.
00:37:05.056,00:37:08.059,"Chicks with dicks. Boobs on top, balls down below."
00:37:08.476,00:37:09.977,I don't get the appeal there.
00:37:10.061,00:37:11.604,It's the other white meat.
00:37:13.439,00:37:15.274,"You know, I've played a sex worker a few times."
00:37:15.358,00:37:19.237,Are you a lady of the night? A courtesan?
00:37:19.320,00:37:22.490,I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a goddess and I'm a fucking model.
00:37:22.990,00:37:24.867,"Now, do you wanna go on a date with me or not?"
00:37:25.284,00:37:26.118,Sure.
00:37:29.080,00:37:30.915,but it's just not all that we are.
00:37:33.042,00:37:33.876,Hi.
00:37:33.960,00:37:37.004,"And as a former sex worker, I feel like I can speak to that."
00:37:37.088,00:37:39.840,And if you're only seeing us as one thing...
00:37:39.924,00:37:41.550,"Oh, you're so sweet."
00:37:46.013,00:37:48.683,people are never gonna get to see us as a whole person.
00:37:50.268,00:37:52.812,DOA is Mark Halsey. Bunch of stab wounds.
00:37:52.895,00:37:54.981,"Mark, so a tranny pross."
00:37:55.398,00:37:57.275,"No, he's just a snappy dresser."
00:37:57.566,00:37:59.944,"That was a statement, like, I know he's a tra..."
00:38:04.323,00:38:12.873,"especially on police shows and hospital shows, perpetrating the transgender victim narrative, and it usually falls into a couple of different tropes."
00:38:12.957,00:38:15.960,"One, someone is murdered because they're transgender."
00:38:16.043,00:38:20.923,"Or the other version, in the hospital drama, is they come into the ER, and their hormones are killing them."
00:38:21.924,00:38:25.678,Or the trans character is dying from some cancer that's affiliated with their birth sex.
00:38:26.721,00:38:30.516,-We think you have testicular cancer. -What?
00:38:30.599,00:38:34.353,I was on a lot of hospital shows. I died a lot. They kept killing me.
00:38:37.231,00:38:41.902,"I'm really-- So, the hormones I've been taking are essentially giving me cancer?"
00:38:42.903,00:38:52.246,Trans people don't die from their life-saving alternatives to the gender containers they've been assigned.
00:38:52.330,00:38:56.417,"Are you saying if I become a woman, I could die?"
00:38:56.917,00:38:58.044,That's not what kills us.
00:38:58.753,00:38:59.920,You have prostate cancer.
00:39:06.052,00:39:08.929,"It's pus. Oh, my God, that's... that's all pus."
00:39:13.768,00:39:18.522,I-I booked them so fast that I didn't even realize the story lines were similar.
00:39:18.939,00:39:22.193,"Both patients ended up having cancer, and..."
00:39:22.443,00:39:25.196,"I mean, they were literally almost the same story line."
00:39:25.279,00:39:29.742,I spent nearly my entire life feeling at war with my gender.
00:39:32.328,00:39:34.789,Figures that the one piece I didn't get rid of...
00:39:35.998,00:39:37.249,is what's gonna kill me.
00:39:41.337,00:39:44.465,"I've died so many times, I can't even count, on camera."
00:39:54.141,00:39:55.810,It was a high dance role.
00:39:55.893,00:40:00.314,"So, they saw me audition, and then they thought, Oh, well, we could..."
00:40:00.815,00:40:06.320,"use Candis as... you said, what? What? Trans?"
00:40:06.404,00:40:07.405,Okay.
00:40:08.697,00:40:10.282,Our Jane Doe's heavier than she looks.
00:40:13.702,00:40:16.288,"Wow, her hands are really big."
00:40:16.372,00:40:18.457,Look at those huge feet.
00:40:19.041,00:40:21.043,She's had her breasts surgically enhanced.
00:40:27.842,00:40:29.343,Better make that a John Doe.
00:40:33.180,00:40:37.101,"I wanted to sit up off the table and be like, You guys, that's bullshit."
00:40:37.184,00:40:39.895,That is so stupid. Come on. You know what I mean?
00:40:39.979,00:40:42.231,"But I was just like, You know what? Let it go."
00:40:42.314,00:40:44.483,"What do you think, Sid? Are we looking at a hate crime?"
00:40:49.613,00:40:50.906,Sound like love to you?
00:40:52.116,00:40:58.164,"The way that she ends up dying, it was so violent and so scary."
00:41:02.126,00:41:17.600,"...story that, for some reason, writers... would write, producers would want to produce, directors would want to direct, because that's the story that people see in the media all the time."
00:41:21.103,00:41:24.231,"He said, I have this idea for a story line. Would you do it?"
00:41:24.315,00:41:27.193,"And I was like, Oh, my God, Nip/Tuck, I'll totally do it."
00:41:27.276,00:41:30.946,"And I read the story line, and I was like, Oh, that's an interesting story line."
00:41:31.030,00:41:32.781,I was kind of creeped out about it.
00:41:33.073,00:41:35.367,I want you to give me a sex-change operation.
00:41:37.661,00:41:38.829,I wanna be a man.
00:41:43.209,00:41:51.133,"reversing back on camera to a boy, and putting on a wig, and trying to strap my... my breasts down."
00:41:55.638,00:41:58.724,"And if there's anything this experience has taught me, it's..."
00:41:59.183,00:42:01.602,that the penis does not make the man.
00:42:02.061,00:42:02.937,It's what's in here.
00:42:05.814,00:42:15.241,"In so many ways, the trans story lines on that show epitomize some of the problematic representations of trans folks."
00:42:15.324,00:42:18.327,"You know, I don't think my mother would approve of me drinking during therapy."
00:42:18.410,00:42:19.245,Do you?
00:42:20.079,00:42:21.247,It isn't therapy.
00:42:22.373,00:42:23.999,And your mother isn't here.
00:42:24.083,00:42:25.334,"What are you, a pedophile?"
00:42:25.417,00:42:33.801,"I put an alarm on this house to keep monsters out, when, shockingly, the true monster was right in front of my face the entire time!"
00:42:37.388,00:42:39.306,"and so, I just thought, This woman's crazy."
00:42:39.390,00:42:42.351,"And then we realize she's trans, and so that is the big reveal."
00:42:42.768,00:42:43.894,Bite me.
00:42:45.104,00:42:46.188,How hard?
00:43:03.080,00:43:04.164,You started it.
00:43:04.707,00:43:06.125,You're gonna finish it.
00:43:07.668,00:43:10.421,"No, no, no, no. No, no! Not that."
00:43:10.504,00:43:11.630,You wanna be conquered?
00:43:14.049,00:43:20.055,"because I think they send messages to men that, like, eventually if you keep trying hard enough, a woman will relent. So..."
00:43:21.056,00:43:21.932,She's...
00:43:23.601,00:43:25.686,"basically... I mean, to me, she's raped."
00:43:25.769,00:43:27.771,"Uh, it's just... It's just a lot of..."
00:43:29.690,00:43:31.025,It's just really hard.
00:43:31.108,00:43:33.235,It's really... It was really hard to watch.
00:43:34.778,00:43:39.908,"And then he stops and runs out, and she's like, Oh, am I not woman enough for you? she says."
00:43:39.992,00:43:44.538,"And then we cut to the next scene, and he's entering a room, and he says: Ava's a man."
00:43:49.001,00:43:51.003,It was about the depth of her vagina.
00:43:51.378,00:43:53.130,"Um, and he's a surgeon and..."
00:43:55.466,00:43:56.800,"So, okay. So, I need to..."
00:43:57.926,00:44:01.930,"Just even talking about this as a trans person, even like..."
00:44:04.099,00:44:07.144,It just... It's so violent. It feels so...
00:44:08.228,00:44:09.521,It's so hard to talk about.
00:44:09.605,00:44:13.192,"I-I can't... I'm-- I'm, like, cringing and, like, I wanna cry talking about it."
00:44:13.275,00:44:16.445,"I wanna cry talking about this narrative, because it's-- it's..."
00:44:17.905,00:44:20.866,It's just horrible. It's just... it's... it's...
00:44:23.619,00:44:24.995,This is what happens to us.
00:44:25.079,00:44:28.082,"This is what happens when we watch, and I think that, like..."
00:44:28.916,00:44:34.421,"I wonder if anyone, when they were constructing these story lines thought about the trans people watching."
00:44:34.880,00:44:35.881,I don't know.
00:44:41.053,00:44:41.970,Who are you?
00:44:46.433,00:44:50.646,"so I didn't see it at the time, but I remember it being in the zeitgeist."
00:44:57.861,00:45:00.114,We have come a long way.
00:45:04.910,00:45:07.955,"I was born with this weirdness, sort of like a birth defect."
00:45:08.288,00:45:12.042,"I mean, it's actually not that rare, but these doctors are trying to fix it."
00:45:12.126,00:45:14.586,I have really weird stuff too.
00:45:17.548,00:45:21.969,"and watching the film recently, I felt super connected to Brandon."
00:45:22.553,00:45:24.221,"You know, to go..."
00:45:25.389,00:45:26.390,bumper surfing.
00:45:26.765,00:45:30.227,"Right? To be drinking beers, to be opening doors for girls..."
00:45:30.310,00:45:31.812,And he gets to live that.
00:45:32.271,00:45:34.606,Nothing can go wrong if we're together.
00:45:34.690,00:45:36.608,"My girlfriend at the time said, Want me to come?"
00:45:36.692,00:45:38.152,"No, I have to see this alone."
00:45:38.235,00:45:41.447,"You sure? This could be painful. I'm like, I have to do this alone."
00:45:41.530,00:45:50.122,"And I went to the theater on the Carlton, near Yonge Street in Toronto, and I went in and watched that movie, and I was..."
00:45:50.956,00:45:52.082,blown away.
00:46:05.846,00:46:07.890,It resonated so deeply for me.
00:46:17.274,00:46:19.401,"but then when I did, it was like..."
00:46:19.985,00:46:20.861,terrifying.
00:46:27.117,00:46:30.287,"I'll do it! I'll do it! Tom, just turn the light off. I'll do it!"
00:46:30.370,00:46:32.831,It was hard to watch. It was really hard to watch.
00:46:32.915,00:46:41.173,"I mean, you know, there's a rape scene in there that's very brutal, but then there's a moment before the rape that I think was literally..."
00:46:42.257,00:46:43.300,my worst nightmare.
00:46:43.383,00:46:45.135,"Come on, I'm holding you until you look."
00:46:46.720,00:46:47.721,Look!
00:46:54.061,00:46:56.146,"as somebody who is, you know..."
00:46:58.273,00:47:00.943,"going through something similar. It's like, I don't ever want that."
00:47:01.026,00:47:03.821,This is something that could happen. I don't ever want that to happen.
00:47:08.534,00:47:10.536,"I was like, Oh, my God, I'm gonna die."
00:47:12.955,00:47:14.248,Where the fuck is she?
00:47:19.419,00:47:24.299,But why is this the kind of story that gets told over and over again?
00:47:24.383,00:47:26.260,"John, she has nothing to do with it."
00:47:34.017,00:47:40.858,"I didn't relate to the film as much because I had seen the documentary first, and that was horrific."
00:47:43.235,00:47:45.195,on this farmstead south of Humboldt.
00:47:45.737,00:47:52.286,"The victims were Teena Brandon of Lincoln, Phillip DeVine of Fairfield, Iowa, and Lisa Lambert of Humboldt."
00:47:55.330,00:47:56.623,from Boys Don't Cry.
00:48:00.252,00:48:04.965,"listening to two people die, and knowing, he had to know, he was next."
00:48:05.048,00:48:15.350,"There was a Black man there who got killed, who was, like, his buddy, who was a friend, an ally to him, and that guy was completely erased from the film."
00:48:15.434,00:48:18.020,And that changed... that changed the film for me.
00:48:18.520,00:48:20.439,"You know? So, um..."
00:48:20.772,00:48:23.817,Because it's this-- it's-- it's the erasure of-- of Black people.
00:48:23.901,00:48:27.905,"So it's like you can't have, like, queer trans people and Blackness in the same space at the same time."
00:48:27.988,00:48:30.449,"So, what's it say about my queer trans Black ass?"
00:48:30.532,00:48:33.493,"Again, this is taking away representation."
00:48:33.577,00:48:37.998,They're telling me that I can't exist in my Blackness and my queerness and my transness.
00:48:38.081,00:48:41.251,I can't bring all of this in at the same time.
00:48:45.964,00:48:50.260,"about the 1969 uprising, we again see a whitewashing of history."
00:49:00.938,00:49:05.442,Stonewall was a bar for hustlers and street queens.
00:49:05.525,00:49:12.324,"It was not, like, you know, this respectability bar where preppy, white gay men went."
00:49:18.789,00:49:24.544,And it was really people who didn't have anything to lose who were just tired of being harassed by the police.
00:49:30.092,00:49:36.139,"You see, in the early '70s, the gay rights movement not wanting to have anything to do with trans people."
00:49:36.556,00:49:38.809,Y'all better quiet down.
00:49:46.316,00:49:49.277,started the gay rights movement.
00:49:50.320,00:49:54.449,I will no longer put up with this shit.
00:49:54.533,00:49:55.993,I have been beaten.
00:49:56.368,00:49:58.704,I have had my nose broken.
00:49:58.787,00:50:00.706,I have been thrown in jail.
00:50:00.789,00:50:02.916,I have lost my job.
00:50:03.000,00:50:09.172,"I have lost my apartment for gay liberation, and you all treat me this way?"
00:50:09.256,00:50:11.508,What the fuck's wrong with you all?
00:50:11.967,00:50:13.552,Think about that!
00:50:17.889,00:50:23.020,and trans people make it really difficult for some people in the queer community to assimilate.
00:50:23.103,00:50:24.187,"And so, what happens?"
00:50:24.604,00:50:27.858,"That section of the queer community is like, You don't exist. Pfft."
00:50:28.525,00:50:43.040,"You know, I think sometimes it's people who feel closest to something that frightens them who are the most vicious, and some of the most transphobic reactions that I know of actually come from gay men."
00:50:49.796,00:50:52.090,where doctors converted him into a woman.
00:50:56.553,00:51:06.563,"from somebody who identified as gay, and it included a... a razor blade in the letter, and said, you know, like, Why don't you finish the job that the doctor started?"
00:51:07.147,00:51:08.023,You know?
00:51:12.736,00:51:21.036,"Trans history changes in 1952, when Christine Jorgensen becomes a global media celebrity."
00:51:22.245,00:51:23.538,Thank you very much.
00:51:26.249,00:51:34.382,"not the first person to have genital surgery or take hormones, but she was the first person to become globally famous for doing that."
00:51:35.759,00:51:39.554,This was the image of transgender for a generation of people.
00:51:47.938,00:51:53.360,She set the ways in which the conversation around trans identity was being had.
00:51:56.196,00:52:03.411,"over the holiday season last year? It was about transsexuals, and there were some horrible stories in there about women who, uh... uh..."
00:52:04.579,00:52:16.925,"would feel the phantom penis coming back and had great psychological problems, or problems in urination, or problems sexually, or psychological problems caused by surgery that possibly was done without proper counseling."
00:52:17.008,00:52:20.137,"Well, there's your answer. You just used the word counseling."
00:52:20.220,00:52:23.932,"We have, and it's a demand, gender identity clinics."
00:52:24.391,00:52:26.393,People always refer to the surgery.
00:52:26.476,00:52:28.270,The surgery is sort of an anticlimax.
00:52:31.690,00:52:35.152,"But to those who do not, that's the word that comes through in the papers."
00:52:38.363,00:52:43.994,This focus on surgery became the ways in which trans people have really been talked about for 60 years.
00:52:44.077,00:52:47.289,"What's going on here, and what's going on..."
00:52:49.040,00:52:53.253,The skin of the penis is used to create what appears to be a vagina.
00:52:53.336,00:52:54.671,-Is that correct? -That's correct.
00:52:54.754,00:52:56.965,How'd you feel about your body when you were back then?
00:52:57.048,00:52:58.133,It wasn't my body.
00:52:58.216,00:52:59.968,And is it acting like a penis?
00:53:00.051,00:53:00.969,Yeah.
00:53:01.052,00:53:02.971,When did you come out? What was your name before?
00:53:03.054,00:53:05.932,What'd you look like? How'd your family take it? Who do you have sex with?
00:53:06.016,00:53:07.684,How did we get on this subject?
00:53:07.767,00:53:10.562,"Turn around. Flip. Go. Okay. Here, everybody look."
00:53:12.439,00:53:15.483,"You make comments, you make questions. Now we have the right to ask you."
00:53:22.073,00:53:23.617,She's really a man.
00:53:23.700,00:53:25.452,Men who used to be women.
00:53:25.535,00:53:29.039,Are you a man? Are you a woman? Are you an it? What are you?
00:53:34.169,00:53:36.588,That's how it felt watching it.
00:53:39.466,00:53:41.134,"I couldn't look away. Like, I would watch."
00:53:45.138,00:53:50.769,"And know that there was something inside of me that connected to these women, but it was also really salacious."
00:53:50.852,00:53:52.687,What would a reaction be from a guy?
00:53:53.313,00:53:55.941,-What is your reaction? -My reaction right now?
00:53:59.402,00:54:00.695,-Uh... -But you're not...
00:54:00.779,00:54:03.949,"-ready to just dive into bed. -No, no, I'm not saying that, but..."
00:54:04.032,00:54:04.866,You know?
00:54:04.950,00:54:06.952,"Well, certainly not here, no."
00:54:10.288,00:54:14.334,with these beautiful trans women who were showgirls at the time.
00:54:14.709,00:54:22.926,"And he's trying to be very delicate with the interview, but he's sort of saying, Well, you know, I-I-I saw these images of you, and..."
00:54:23.009,00:54:26.096,and-- and there seems to be no suggestion of male genitalia.
00:54:29.766,00:54:32.310,What... what happens? What... what happens to it?
00:54:37.232,00:54:39.985,of when Caroline Cossey was on The Arsenio Hall Show.
00:54:40.652,00:54:43.321,And Arsenio Hall had a very similar line of questioning.
00:54:43.405,00:54:48.660,"But how did you keep people from knowing, if you were a stripper, that you had a penis?"
00:54:49.369,00:54:51.413,"Well, I sort of, tucked it away, and..."
00:54:53.415,00:54:55.000,"...stuck it up my rosebud, actually."
00:54:56.668,00:54:58.336,W-Was it a real small penis?
00:54:58.420,00:55:00.630,"'Cause I'd have a hard time tucking mine away, you know?"
00:55:03.633,00:55:04.467,Whoo!
00:55:06.052,00:55:07.387,That was...
00:55:07.470,00:55:08.305,"Oh, my God."
00:55:08.388,00:55:10.849,That was really... That's really hard to watch now.
00:55:10.932,00:55:12.142,Can you have an orgasm?
00:55:12.642,00:55:15.812,"Well, I think, like most women say, you know, it depends on the guy, really."
00:55:21.109,00:55:23.361,For her and her humor and her wit.
00:55:24.404,00:55:27.115,"I mean, I was like, I wish I could be like her."
00:55:27.198,00:55:33.538,"Hey, I'd like to know if you just pose for these magazines and make these comments just to try to prove to yourself that you're a woman."
00:55:33.621,00:55:36.833,I don't have to prove to anyone or myself that I'm a woman. I am a woman.
00:55:40.795,00:55:43.465,the way that trans people were exploited for those kinds of stories.
00:55:43.548,00:55:56.728,"I have to admit, it was also really cool just to see actual trans people on television The only thing about dating straight men and living this way is that they are more afraid of what their friends will say and perceive."
00:55:58.813,00:56:00.940,are monuments in our community.
00:56:01.024,00:56:05.653,"There's gender identity, which is What am I? Am I a man or a woman?"
00:56:05.737,00:56:08.823,"Then there's sexual orientation, which is Who do I love? Men or women?"
00:56:08.907,00:56:10.075,They're two different things.
00:56:11.409,00:56:16.206,It was a hustle for them. It was an opportunity to get paid and...
00:56:17.457,00:56:18.958,to tell their story.
00:56:19.959,00:56:21.044,And it did reach us.
00:56:21.127,00:56:30.595,"It's been estimated that there's probably one in 40,000 births or something like that are people that fall into... to the category that... that you would call transsexual."
00:56:30.845,00:56:44.901,"Uh, there are many, many others who... who are sort of marginal, and-- to hear there are other people, there are a lot of other people, that it's just fine and dandy."
00:56:44.984,00:56:47.278,Not all of us live in New York or San Francisco.
00:56:47.362,00:56:52.951,"But listening to someone as articulate as Leslie or David, you know, like, that, I think, is gonna give them the hope and the strength."
00:56:53.034,00:56:55.286,"For all our lives, we've always heard..."
00:56:55.370,00:56:58.873,seen ourselves refracted through other people's prisms.
00:57:01.543,00:57:04.295,"describe what our feelings are, what our thoughts are."
00:57:04.379,00:57:08.591,How about talking about why Jesse Helms needs some therapy?
00:57:12.178,00:57:13.263,What...
00:57:13.346,00:57:17.600,"What on earth is going through the minds of those Klansmen, you know?"
00:57:18.601,00:57:37.370,"And so, if... if we're going to talk about our situations, 'cause if you don't name an oppression, you can't fight it, you know, basically, you can't organize around it, is that we want our own voices to be heard, and that's what the civil rights movement did, that's what the women's movement did-- And in a little way, that's what The Joan Rivers Show has done today."
00:57:40.331,00:57:53.970,"uplifted, and well regarded in film and television can endear you to step in when you see a trans person being harassed on the street, and to make sure the trans people in your life are supported in ways that affirm their humanity."
00:57:56.055,00:57:57.056,You're a man?
00:57:57.140,00:57:58.141,"Oh, hey."
00:57:58.641,00:58:00.310,"-It's okay. -No, it's not okay."
00:58:00.393,00:58:02.395,I swear I didn't mean for you to find out like this.
00:58:05.023,00:58:06.900,we're put further in harm's way.
00:58:06.983,00:58:08.526,-Talk to me! -Please don't touch me!
00:58:12.906,00:58:18.328,you see how often all the people around the trans character feel betrayed or lied to.
00:58:22.457,00:58:26.419,...in the sense that it presupposes that there is something to disclose.
00:58:27.212,00:58:30.465,"You told me about your parents, your sister, your hobbies."
00:58:31.549,00:58:33.885,We sat for three hours on a porch talking about everything.
00:58:33.968,00:58:36.513,You left out the fact that you used to be a man.
00:58:37.180,00:58:38.014,I'm sorry.
00:58:39.849,00:58:52.028,"that there is a secret that is hidden and that I have a responsibility to tell others, and that presupposes that the other person might have some kind of issue or problem with what's to be disclosed."
00:58:56.699,00:59:00.119,And that their feelings matter more than mine.
00:59:04.832,00:59:08.711,to facilitate the growth of the straight white man.
00:59:09.671,00:59:17.637,"In the real-life Dallas Buyers Club story, there was actually no Rayon character."
00:59:17.720,00:59:18.638,I'm Rayon.
00:59:22.684,00:59:24.060,Congratulations.
00:59:25.478,00:59:27.438,Fuck off and go back to your bed.
00:59:32.777,00:59:36.030,the heterosexual character gets his act together.
00:59:37.073,00:59:37.949,You fuckin' high?
00:59:39.075,00:59:40.118,None of your business.
00:59:40.660,00:59:42.537,And he becomes a hero.
00:59:42.620,00:59:49.085,"I mean, god damn, people are dying, and y'all are all up there afraid that we're gonna find an alternative without you."
00:59:49.168,00:59:50.420,Rayon's character...
00:59:52.005,00:59:57.176,"...has a drug relapse, gets sick, and dies."
00:59:58.511,01:00:05.768,Showing up with all the piss and vinegar and sassiness to wake up this guy and shake up the assumptions.
01:00:06.144,01:00:08.313,"Okay, she's done that. He's on his way."
01:00:08.396,01:00:09.647,Oh. Kill her.
01:00:10.231,01:00:11.649,And the Oscar goes to...
01:00:18.281,01:00:31.961,"you know, in his white tuxedo and a full beard and it certainly was very clear to me in that moment that the world was seeing him as a man despite Rayon having been portrayed quite beautifully and sensitively in the movie."
01:00:32.378,01:00:34.881,"And I realized, like, that's part of this larger narrative."
01:00:34.964,01:00:35.923,Lili.
01:00:38.968,01:00:43.514,as men with really good hair and makeup in costume.
01:00:44.182,01:00:50.104,And that's reinforced every time we see a man who's played a trans woman off-screen.
01:00:50.480,01:00:51.773,Can I come in?
01:00:51.856,01:00:55.360,I'm... I... I got no job. I don't have friends. I can't live.
01:00:55.443,01:00:56.986,I-I have to live with people.
01:01:00.948,01:01:05.328,"...of this issue around trans casting, particularly of men."
01:01:05.870,01:01:10.458,"In real life, that woman, Elizabeth Eden, was a remarkably beautiful trans woman."
01:01:10.541,01:01:22.553,"And, at that time, when they were first doing the movie, they did go out to a trans actress, Elizabeth Coffey Williams, and they told her that she looked too much like a real woman to play the part."
01:01:24.722,01:01:32.021,"So, instead, they cast Chris Sarandon, and it was his very first movie role, and he was nominated for an Oscar for it."
01:01:37.360,01:01:39.028,This has been going on for 40 years.
01:01:52.250,01:01:55.837,"in my mind, is a direct link to the violence against trans women."
01:01:56.212,01:02:14.063,"And in my mind, part of the reason that men end up killing trans women out of fear that other men will think that they're gay for having been with trans women, is that the friends, the men whose judgment they fear of, only know trans women from media and the people who are playing trans women are the men that they know."
01:02:14.647,01:02:17.275,This doesn't happen when a trans woman plays a trans woman.
01:02:21.195,01:02:22.739,as she is on-screen.
01:02:22.822,01:02:28.703,"As is Jazzmun, as is Trace Lysette, and Alexandra Billings and Angelica Ross and so on."
01:02:29.120,01:02:35.585,"When you see these women off-screen still as women, it completely deflates this idea that they're somehow men in disguise."
01:02:39.255,01:02:41.549,Whereas if I'm playing a trans character...
01:02:41.632,01:02:47.263,Looking at who we really are or what we really want can be terrifying.
01:02:47.346,01:02:49.390,...I don't have to play the transness of it.
01:02:54.228,01:02:58.649,"When someone like Eddie Redmayne, who admittedly might give a really great performance as a trans woman..."
01:02:58.733,01:02:59.901,Am I pretty enough?
01:03:01.235,01:03:02.487,Of course you are.
01:03:06.073,01:03:24.509,"is the way that he's been able to manifest those feminine parts of himself into a convincing trans performance, but it reduces that person, in this case, who was a real person, to a performance of transness, to a performance of femininity, rather than as a whole person, of whom transness is one aspect of."
01:03:28.137,01:03:38.981,"In this year of women in film, I am here to present an award for a category in which women have traditionally found it difficult to gain a toehold: Best Supporting Actor."
01:03:42.026,01:03:48.449,"I think it can be safely said, however, that this year was a breakthrough year in this category."
01:04:02.588,01:04:06.843,"When The Crying Game came out, everybody was like, Don't tell the secret of The Crying Game."
01:04:06.926,01:04:08.761,"The secret is, like, crazy."
01:04:08.845,01:04:10.471,"It's crazy! Oh, my God."
01:04:20.481,01:04:21.566,"Oh, my God."
01:04:24.986,01:04:26.320,"Jesus, I feel sick."
01:04:28.114,01:04:29.407,"Don't go, Jimmy."
01:04:40.209,01:04:42.128,The puking. Um...
01:04:45.339,01:04:47.592,"I mean, it just... You know, I feel emotional when I..."
01:04:47.675,01:04:50.386,when I even talk about... uh... the... the repulsion.
01:04:51.262,01:04:54.307,"Um, because that's how I felt about myself for so long."
01:04:54.390,01:04:57.685,"Like, will people be repelled? Will people be... you know..."
01:04:58.895,01:05:00.438,The... the word disgust.
01:05:01.147,01:05:05.484,"You know, there's so much shame that people have to fight through..."
01:05:06.193,01:05:07.778,and come out the other side of.
01:05:08.487,01:05:13.451,"And then it emerges in weird, insidious ways somewhere down the road, and you're like, What? That's up again?"
01:05:16.037,01:05:17.747,I'm bleeding.
01:05:17.830,01:05:34.722,"You know, I didn't... It took me many years to understand the ways in which it was flawed, because I think at the time, when I was, like, ten years old, just seeing that beautiful woman with a penis changed, like, my whole perception of what was possible."
01:05:35.473,01:05:37.892,I don't know what the director's intentions were in this film.
01:05:38.309,01:05:42.063,I suspect he did wanna create an empathetic portrayal of a trans woman.
01:05:42.146,01:05:48.486,"But in the same way that Psycho created this ripple effect of cross-dressing, psychopathic serial killers..."
01:05:50.988,01:05:57.161,...The Crying Game created a ripple effect of men reacting with vomiting when they see a transgender woman.
01:06:06.712,01:06:09.256,when you see a transgender person's body is to vomit.
01:06:17.431,01:06:19.850,Your gun is digging into my hip.
01:06:19.934,01:06:22.311,"As a kid, my favorite movie was Ace Ventura: Pet Detective."
01:06:28.734,01:06:33.489,"And then I was watching it in college, as I was transitioning."
01:06:33.572,01:06:35.032,And I was really down...
01:06:37.743,01:06:41.998,...and I think I wanted something that I knew was gonna bring me up and make me happy.
01:06:42.873,01:06:44.750,And then we get to the end...
01:06:44.834,01:06:46.961,"Oh, my God!"
01:06:47.336,01:06:49.088,Einhorn is a man!
01:07:00.975,01:07:12.111,"barfing, inducing barfing, brushing his teeth, scraping out his tongue, gargling with mouthwash, trying to, like, cleanse himself of the fact that he has made romantic contact with a trans person."
01:07:12.737,01:07:15.197,"Or with a man. I mean, you can see it through a homophobic lens."
01:07:15.281,01:07:16.949,It's both homophobic and transphobic.
01:07:17.450,01:07:21.245,"And then, as he's gonna, like, have his Scooby-Doo moment..."
01:07:24.498,01:07:32.590,"...he does so by, like, pulling down her skirt, turning her around, and exposing the fact that, like, her genitals are tucked."
01:07:40.848,01:07:48.731,"That, like, you are a trans person who existed made people physically ill was the way in which my favorite movie as a child ended."
01:07:58.115,01:07:59.408,to go back and think...
01:08:01.827,01:08:06.707,"as an out trans person, if I had never seen any representation of myself in the media."
01:08:07.083,01:08:20.971,"On the one hand, I might not have ever internalized that sense of-- of being monstrous, of having fears around disclosure, of seeing myself as something abhorrent and as-- as a punchline and-- and as a joke."
01:08:21.055,01:08:25.810,I might be able to go on a date with a man without having the image of men vomiting.
01:08:25.893,01:08:32.733,"On the flip side, would I even know I'm trans if I had never seen any kind of depiction of gender variance on-screen."
01:08:42.451,01:08:48.457,"One of the things that I struggled with as a trans person was, Who will ever love me?"
01:08:48.541,01:08:49.750,Who will love this?
01:08:50.709,01:08:51.585,"Rest, Neo."
01:08:51.669,01:08:53.003,The answers are coming.
01:08:55.965,01:09:09.895,"forces people to look back on my work and apply a trans narrative to it, because I wasn't making The Matrix films as specifically trans narratives."
01:09:10.855,01:09:22.241,"One of the most striking things to me is the burbling undercurrent of rage that I felt, in the end, not being able to be who I was."
01:09:23.826,01:09:29.874,"Trying to find myself in media and film was, uh, extremely difficult."
01:09:29.957,01:09:36.839,"There was something about Bugs Bunny that activated, in my trans imagination, this idea of transformation."
01:09:46.640,01:09:51.687,"I watched a lot of television, watched a lot of movies, and the only..."
01:09:52.730,01:09:59.320,only positive representation I saw of anything transfeminine was Bugs Bunny.
01:10:06.410,01:10:09.413,Bugs Bunny was desirable and was powerful.
01:10:20.716,01:10:30.893,"Bugs Bunny is a character that is born of imagination and exists in a space in between me and its creator, and therefore is a little bit more accessible to me and my young mind."
01:10:33.979,01:10:41.695,I would always look back on that episode with a certain glee about the transformative aspects of it.
01:10:42.738,01:10:45.783,"And that Bugs looked, you know, really cute."
01:10:45.866,01:10:46.867,I liked that part.
01:11:09.139,01:11:11.225,I'll kill the wabbit!
01:11:11.308,01:11:12.434,...in cartoon form.
01:11:19.942,01:11:21.110,A happy ending?
01:11:34.623,01:11:40.671,"that my own story was on the screen, because I was that little boy who wanted to be a girl."
01:11:41.880,01:11:45.134,"And nobody understood, and nobody knew what to do with me."
01:11:50.139,01:11:54.268,"I grew up in Syracuse, New York, which is a really isolated place, culturally."
01:11:54.351,01:12:00.983,"There was the library, and there was a video store, and those were, like, my conduits to a larger world."
01:12:03.360,01:12:05.863,I'm tryin' to iron in here.
01:12:07.531,01:12:10.492,and I remember renting the videotape of Hairspray.
01:12:10.576,01:12:14.455,"Okay, young ladies, I've heard just about enough of this screeching music."
01:12:14.538,01:12:17.624,"And having the sense that, Edna Turnblad..."
01:12:17.708,01:12:19.335,There was something different about her.
01:12:28.385,01:12:34.099,"So I think that those kinds of, like, slippages are really meaningful for a young person."
01:12:35.184,01:12:44.193,"I mean, when you look at Holly Woodlawn, and Candy Darling, and Jackie Curtis in Paul Morrissey films, they were never playing trans characters."
01:12:44.276,01:12:46.987,The actor's gender never comes into it.
01:12:47.654,01:12:48.822,I'm young.
01:12:49.365,01:12:50.657,I wanna live.
01:12:51.700,01:12:59.833,"As a young person, when I started to identify as queer, I was so captivated by elder queer people."
01:12:59.917,01:13:10.594,"And Flawless Sabrina was, like, one of the first people I met when I was 18 years old and had just moved to New York City, and she was this elderly queen, and..."
01:13:11.762,01:13:16.767,I was fascinated by her and by the history that she unlocked for me.
01:13:20.979,01:13:22.606,"The queen says, Monique."
01:13:23.273,01:13:27.027,"And you say, That-- That's marvelous, darling, but what was your name before?"
01:13:27.111,01:13:31.782,"And the queen will look at you straight in the eye and say, There was no before."
01:13:36.453,01:13:43.836,"was, like, the pinnacle of the drag balls that she started doing in 1959."
01:13:43.919,01:13:46.422,"But at that point, it was called female impersonation."
01:13:46.505,01:13:48.340,It was illegal.
01:13:49.466,01:13:51.427,"Um, she was arrested a whole lot."
01:13:56.473,01:14:09.486,"people could go to an art-house movie theater and see real-life trans people, but it wasn't until 1990 that the mainstream took notice of a film that centered trans women of color."
01:14:11.572,01:14:14.116,And that film is Paris is Burning.
01:14:17.244,01:14:23.250,"between All My Children and Jeopardy, Another World, Dallas, and the whole bit."
01:14:23.333,01:14:24.960,An evening bag is a must.
01:14:25.669,01:14:28.505,You have to carry something. No lady is sure at night.
01:14:31.800,01:14:33.969,but I didn't really understand...
01:14:35.095,01:14:38.015,what I was watching. I just saw beautiful people on the screen.
01:14:50.152,01:14:57.910,"When it fully came to me for actual understanding, I was like, Oh, my God, like..."
01:14:58.368,01:15:01.413,"These are my sisters up here, but the struggle is real."
01:15:01.497,01:15:08.462,"You know, I ran away from my house when I was 14, and I've learned all sorts of things, good and bad, and how to survive in gay world."
01:15:08.545,01:15:09.838,"You know, it's kinda hard."
01:15:09.922,01:15:17.971,"It's just, there's so many iconic moments that allowed me to see myself as a working-class trans woman in New York City."
01:15:25.103,01:15:28.273,and wanting that kind of family bond.
01:15:34.446,01:15:35.572,"Oh, my goodness."
01:15:35.906,01:15:38.033,I'm getting warm and fuzzy all over again.
01:15:38.784,01:15:39.618,Uh...
01:15:39.701,01:15:42.871,I discovered ballroom in 1995. I'm 14.
01:15:43.163,01:15:44.748,Going to school.
01:15:45.249,01:15:46.166,School.
01:15:50.003,01:15:52.548,"so validating, so loving."
01:15:55.968,01:16:00.472,"I've heard people say things like, Well, there were no trans men in ballroom in the '80s or the '90s."
01:16:02.558,01:16:06.144,The problem is that there wasn't language for transmasculine communities at all.
01:16:06.728,01:16:08.522,Can I have a few of you over here?
01:16:10.899,01:16:13.151,I love Octavia St. Laurent.
01:16:13.610,01:16:15.195,I wanna be somebody.
01:16:15.487,01:16:17.239,"I mean, I am somebody."
01:16:23.328,01:16:35.591,"I understand, like, why it's important for, uh, specifically trans women of color to seek out validation in a heteronormative, white, cis world."
01:16:37.968,01:16:40.554,I was in the House of LaBeija.
01:16:44.558,01:16:45.934,Give her some walking music.
01:16:48.937,01:16:52.566,"but, at the time, I didn't think I could join in fully."
01:16:53.233,01:16:55.902,"Yeah, I was too busy trying to be real."
01:17:01.241,01:17:03.744,I had to separate. I had to make a choice.
01:17:05.537,01:17:06.371,Yeah.
01:17:10.250,01:17:15.547,"There was a buzz around the film being made, but the kids didn't get any recognition."
01:17:15.964,01:17:18.133,I felt that she took advantage of all of us.
01:17:18.675,01:17:20.510,"All of us, you know."
01:17:21.553,01:17:23.347,But I didn't benefit nothing out of it.
01:17:25.474,01:17:27.601,have been seeing Paris Is Burning as something good?
01:17:27.684,01:17:29.227,Because they're looking outside in.
01:17:29.311,01:17:32.564,"Paris Is Burning is, like, their... their motto or something."
01:17:36.860,01:17:38.320,and tell those stories?
01:17:38.403,01:17:41.531,And how do we have a critical relationship so that we learn?
01:17:45.952,01:17:49.998,"and then, suddenly, here's Madonna's Vogue, and then people think Madonna created vogue."
01:18:01.760,01:18:12.354,"You see pop culture appropriate ballroom over and over and over, and I think it's important to remember who's from that world..."
01:18:14.314,01:18:15.357,and do right by it.
01:18:23.990,01:18:28.120,"I can be critical of Paris Is Burning, but I'm so happy Paris Is Burning also exists."
01:18:29.162,01:18:30.706,And I love the film.
01:18:31.289,01:18:36.628,"If you shoot a arrow and it goes real high, hooray for you."
01:18:42.050,01:18:46.388,"you know, was being grand, and I pushed it all out."
01:18:47.305,01:18:51.601,I'm living in my new pronoun that I've... Stealth.
01:19:02.654,01:19:03.572,and...
01:19:04.072,01:19:05.282,be afraid?
01:19:06.867,01:19:10.328,Your head is trying desperately to stay in the scene.
01:19:12.873,01:19:16.126,You wake up afraid. You go to sleep afraid.
01:19:16.209,01:19:21.715,"You're trying to figure out if somebody's gonna drop the bomb that day, the next day. When is it gonna happen?"
01:19:21.798,01:19:24.676,"So, you're just afraid all the time."
01:19:26.136,01:19:28.096,You got so much on the outside.
01:19:29.431,01:19:32.017,We'll just see how much you got on the inside.
01:19:32.100,01:19:35.520,"But anyway, I did what I had to do. It was called survival."
01:19:36.104,01:19:37.272,It was called survival.
01:19:39.191,01:19:40.025,I'm all right.
01:19:41.401,01:19:42.861,I will survive.
01:19:47.240,01:19:52.788,"And you wanna go, and you wanna say, Girl, ain't we somethin'?"
01:19:53.455,01:19:55.332,"But, nah, you just left it alone."
01:19:55.415,01:19:58.126,"I wish I could've. Man, wouldn't that have been good."
01:20:05.759,01:20:10.889,that there were people who transitioned decades before me and had full careers.
01:20:12.724,01:20:16.394,Ajita Wilson transitioned in the mid '70s.
01:20:16.478,01:20:18.438,Wouldn't you be jealous if I went with another man?
01:20:21.358,01:20:23.860,"When the job includes a diamond, it makes things much nicer."
01:20:26.404,01:20:34.746,was this incredible model in the 1970s who was on a Clairol hair color box and modeled for Essence magazine.
01:20:34.830,01:20:47.342,"It's important for me to know that these Black trans women were doing it, you know, back in the day, and how many more Ajita Wilsons and Tracey Africas were out there doing their thing that we don't know about because living stealth was the way to survive."
01:20:49.010,01:20:56.184,It wasn't until 2007 that we saw an openly trans woman being celebrated for doing it out loud.
01:20:56.685,01:20:59.271,Candis Cayne makes history on Dirty Sexy Money...
01:21:04.276,01:21:14.703,"I had a big gathering with all of my friends, and I was so excited I was gonna be on ABC, and there was, like, ten of us, and we were all, like, sitting around having a glass of wine."
01:21:20.083,01:21:22.252,And then my first line...
01:21:25.422,01:21:27.215,They lowered it two octaves.
01:21:31.303,01:21:39.686,"And everybody, the loud party, was like, Ah-- It was the most horrifying thing ever."
01:21:40.270,01:21:41.897,"I'll come when the party's over, okay?"
01:21:41.980,01:21:43.356,"Oh, yes, you will."
01:21:46.026,01:21:50.488,to get the idea that Carmelita was a trans woman.
01:21:51.489,01:21:54.951,Thank God I had chemistry with Billy Baldwin.
01:21:56.578,01:21:58.955,"And he's like, This story line's gonna steal the show."
01:22:01.249,01:22:10.759,"My whole point to this is to not only tell trans children that they're okay, but their parents."
01:22:10.842,01:22:15.221,That this is just something that some human beings are.
01:22:15.305,01:22:21.436,"That moment made me believe it was possible for me, too, to be openly trans and to..."
01:22:22.729,01:22:25.148,"to act, and, um..."
01:22:27.233,01:22:28.360,...it was everything.
01:22:28.944,01:22:35.951,"A few years later, Chaz Bono was nominated for producing Becoming Chaz in 2011."
01:22:39.788,01:22:41.498,it's because I wanna try to help people.
01:22:41.581,01:22:45.293,"You know, I wanna try to put a face on an issue that people don't understand."
01:22:45.961,01:22:49.589,I didn't transition until 2009.
01:22:50.131,01:23:02.310,"So, uh, I went through, you know, a very long period, a very dark period, of knowing that I was trans but not feeling like I could do anything about it."
01:23:02.394,01:23:07.941,"I mean, I thought about faking my own death Chaz! Why, honey?"
01:23:08.024,01:23:10.110,"So I could just do this, and nobody would know."
01:23:10.819,01:23:15.782,The good thing was that I got to a point of such clarity about it.
01:23:34.926,01:23:50.734,"Honestly. I mean, that was my motivation at that point to stay on, because I knew that on Dancing with the Stars, I would hit an audience that was gonna be larger than had ever been in contact with a transgender person at that point before."
01:23:50.817,01:24:18.762,"So, that kept me really going, and it was hard and I contribute that cultural shift to us, to the work that all of us here are doing."
01:24:20.847,01:24:24.017,And I'm just really proud of us. We've come so far.
01:24:31.107,01:24:34.652,There's a show about a women's prison on Netflix. It's a web series.
01:24:34.944,01:24:36.279,"Then, There's a part for you."
01:24:36.362,01:24:39.991,"At the time, this was 2012, streaming series weren't a thing."
01:24:40.075,01:24:45.330,"So I was like, I have a web... I'm doing a web series on Netflix, and, like, I didn't think anybody was gonna see it."
01:24:55.173,01:24:59.052,"and I knew that it was from the creators of Weeds, and I was like, This is gonna be really good."
01:24:59.135,01:25:02.931,"And so, when I first watched it, there was Laverne."
01:25:03.014,01:25:04.099,Excuse me.
01:25:04.182,01:25:06.351,-Such pretty hair. -Thank you.
01:25:09.020,01:25:10.647,I'll take good care of you.
01:25:10.730,01:25:13.983,"To see that character over the, now, years..."
01:25:15.735,01:25:21.533,"The complexities, the backstory, the power that she's, kind of, given."
01:25:21.616,01:25:24.994,"In the Black community, the hairdresser, it's the pinnacle, right?"
01:25:25.078,01:25:27.330,And the fact that there's a Black trans woman running this?
01:25:27.413,01:25:28.998,That was amazing to me.
01:25:29.082,01:25:33.211,You really wanna be calling me a lady-man when I got a fistful of your hair in my hand?
01:25:35.630,01:25:39.634,"and she's still a problem in society. You know, she's still a menace to society."
01:25:39.717,01:25:44.389,"It's not like she's changing people's lives, you know, by doing their-- these-- these prisoners' hair."
01:25:44.722,01:25:46.599,"So, come on, but..."
01:25:47.016,01:25:48.685,she's such a smart woman.
01:25:48.768,01:25:52.856,"I'm a big fan, and I like how she took it to another level."
01:26:00.280,01:26:01.906,while being trans.
01:26:02.323,01:26:07.704,And the only other reference point I had for that was maybe Candis Cayne on Dirty Sexy Money.
01:26:08.163,01:26:11.291,Maybe the occasional guest spot by Alexandra Billings.
01:26:11.374,01:26:15.420,"If people were really one in Christ, how could my boyfriend have left me after the operation?"
01:26:16.671,01:26:19.841,"I'll serve, you explain, and do not go easy on that person."
01:26:21.634,01:26:25.013,"Okay, baby. Yes, I am a bitch, and proud of it, honey."
01:26:25.096,01:26:28.099,But not at this magnitude.
01:26:28.183,01:26:33.855,"She is an Emmy-nominated actress, a human rights activist, an all-around icon-- Laverne..."
01:26:33.938,01:26:34.772,-Cox! -Cox!
01:26:34.856,01:26:36.524,"Oh, my goodness."
01:26:40.528,01:26:42.280,is all the folks who...
01:26:42.947,01:26:50.997,"have empathy for the character that I play, and then find themselves having empathy for the actress who plays her. And..."
01:26:51.873,01:26:53.583,I would argue that that doesn't...
01:26:54.083,01:26:56.836,always happen when cis people play us.
01:26:57.462,01:27:01.341,"First I saw Laverne Cox, just took my head and just spun it right on around."
01:27:02.800,01:27:05.053,And then I saw another film.
01:27:05.762,01:27:07.597,"I said, What's... What's happening?"
01:27:07.805,01:27:10.767,Did... Did we overcome and nobody told me? What's happening?
01:27:10.850,01:27:14.646,"I think right now it's very urgent to connect through stories, and-- and new stories."
01:27:18.691,01:27:21.903,What is going on? How are the children doing this?
01:27:27.575,01:27:31.829,that we shot the pilot for Transparent.
01:27:32.538,01:27:39.128,"And I think it was a really untraditional set, you know, and process."
01:27:40.296,01:27:47.387,Just the amount of trans people that were employed and being brought into the fold of Hollywood and decision-maker positions.
01:27:47.470,01:27:51.766,"Like, they weren't just consultants, they were producers."
01:27:54.811,01:27:57.480,I brought you here because it seemed fun.
01:28:02.819,01:28:05.780,"Okay, well, now that you mention it, I did pay for all this."
01:28:06.197,01:28:07.448,"Fuck you, Josh."
01:28:09.367,01:28:12.662,"I see right through you, and I'm not your fucking adventure!"
01:28:14.038,01:28:17.542,I'm a person. I'm not your fucking adventure!
01:28:21.045,01:28:22.338,Let's say Jeffrey Tambor.
01:28:28.761,01:28:33.474,I'm talking about being sexually harassed by Jeffrey Tambor on the set of Transparent.
01:28:33.558,01:28:44.360,"I spoke the truth, and I was blessed to have you with me, and I appreciate you so much for going through that with me."
01:28:48.156,01:28:50.366,"No, uh, because we're trans."
01:28:50.450,01:28:53.328,And so I'm used to people not wanting to believe us.
01:28:56.080,01:28:57.165,If you're going to...
01:28:58.124,01:29:14.057,"choose to insert yourself in the telling of a particular community's story, or you want to help a particular community tell their story, you need to realize the privileges that you have, and you need to realize that life for them is different."
01:29:16.559,01:29:18.603,Please welcome Carmen Carrera.
01:29:30.239,01:29:33.201,and Katie asked Carmen...
01:29:33.284,01:29:41.042,Your... your private parts I don't want to talk about it because it's-- it's still... it's really personal.
01:29:41.125,01:29:42.919,"And, um... I don't know."
01:29:43.002,01:29:49.967,"I just-- I'd rather talk about my modeling stuff, I'd rather talk about being in W, and being, you know, maybe in Italian Vogue, and doing fun stuff and..."
01:29:50.051,01:29:54.138,"and showing people that after their transition, there's still life to live."
01:30:00.937,01:30:02.188,and Carmen was sort of...
01:30:02.271,01:30:08.903,"uh, recoiled a little bit when I asked her about her transition, and I'm wondering if you have the same feelings about that that Carmen does?"
01:30:08.986,01:30:11.072,I do. I was very proud of you for saying that.
01:30:11.489,01:30:18.204,"The preoccupation with transition and with surgery objectifies trans people, and then we don't get to really deal with the real lived experiences."
01:30:18.287,01:30:23.042,The reality of-- of trans people's lives is that so often we're targets of violence.
01:30:23.126,01:30:26.838,We experience discrimination disproportionately to the rest of the community.
01:30:26.921,01:30:30.341,"And when we focus on transition, we don't actually get to talk about those things."
01:30:34.178,01:30:42.520,"people will avoid a subject altogether or become reactionary or... or bitter or angry, and Katie really did the opposite."
01:30:42.603,01:30:55.825,"I want to use this as a teachable moment, not only for myself, but how do we explain, sort of, what is the appropriate conversation and how do we make people feel if we don't have an example of what you shouldn't do?"
01:31:00.496,01:31:02.707,That's because we understand we ain't got nothing to lose.
01:31:02.790,01:31:05.293,"I already done lost that job, I done lost that job."
01:31:05.668,01:31:09.005,So I'm only gonna gain by being authentic and by telling the truth.
01:31:13.468,01:31:15.470,"-...who arrived, baby. -Hello."
01:31:15.553,01:31:16.596,How are you doing?
01:31:16.679,01:31:18.973,"-You made it. -Yes, I did. Hi. How are you?"
01:31:21.934,01:31:24.896,you can say what you want about the Kardashians ruining America.
01:31:24.979,01:31:26.731,I Am Cait's not really about Caitlyn.
01:31:31.152,01:31:35.448,brilliant group of trans women who are having conversations with one another.
01:31:35.531,01:31:39.327,Which Republican candidate do you think will be most supportive of transgender people?
01:31:46.417,01:31:48.586,"Oh, I hate trans people, or I hate gays."
01:31:48.669,01:31:49.670,Don't think of that.
01:31:50.129,01:31:55.593,"I find it really problematic that they say trans, you know, activist or advocate Caitlyn Jenner saying this."
01:31:55.676,01:32:02.767,"No, it's Caitlyn Jenner, who's a very specific person, with a specific set of experiences that are very monied, very white, very privileged."
01:32:02.850,01:32:05.061,I stridently disagree with all of her views.
01:32:05.144,01:32:07.730,The fact is is that her show did a lot of good.
01:32:10.107,01:32:16.822,"because my parents, from the very beginning, were completely supportive, so I applaud you guys for being here."
01:32:18.115,01:32:21.285,where there were parents talking about their kids.
01:32:21.369,01:32:26.541,"If you have a transgender kid, you are living with a unicorn, an amazing human being."
01:32:26.624,01:32:31.420,"To be next to someone so brave, so cool, so close to themselves."
01:32:31.504,01:32:35.925,"The reality is Avery has been on point from age two, apparently. Know what I mean?"
01:32:42.014,01:32:43.933,and it just... it hurt because...
01:32:44.725,01:32:52.316,"I had to be okay with my mom saying, I will never call you Jen because Jen murdered my son."
01:32:53.067,01:32:57.405,"I had to-- I had to be okay with that in order to survive myself, you know?"
01:32:57.947,01:33:05.079,In order to deal with not being able to see my grandma before she died because I could only come home if I dressed as a boy.
01:33:05.913,01:33:06.872,You know.
01:33:06.956,01:33:13.337,"I had to deal with the fact that one of my best friends, who, like, I stood up at his wedding, won't let me meet his children."
01:33:13.963,01:33:17.592,"I have to deal with those things. Like, I have to live with those things."
01:33:17.883,01:33:19.427,And I have to make that okay.
01:33:19.510,01:33:22.638,I have to understand their position and be okay with it.
01:33:23.264,01:33:39.238,"And when I saw that father go so much further than I thought was even possible, it hurt, I couldn't bear it, because then, all of a sudden, all those people who couldn't accept me, when I knew it was possible to go beyond acceptance..."
01:33:40.656,01:33:42.241,Why couldn't my mom have been like him?
01:33:42.325,01:33:44.785,That's the question I never asked until that moment.
01:33:44.869,01:33:46.579,Why couldn't my mom have been like him?
01:33:46.662,01:33:51.000,Why couldn't my friends have been like him and seen the value in my experience?
01:33:52.376,01:33:57.465,But the person who's most responsible for failing to have that kind of vision is me.
01:33:58.049,01:34:01.594,I have never seen myself the way that father saw his own child.
01:34:01.677,01:34:03.262,I'd never seen myself that way.
01:34:03.346,01:34:05.765,I'd never looked at myself with the kind of...
01:34:06.390,01:34:11.646,love and respect and awe that that father had for his own child.
01:34:12.188,01:34:15.358,No one's looked at me that way. How could I look at me that way?
01:34:17.693,01:34:18.694,I had to see it.
01:34:19.362,01:34:21.364,"And now that I have, I want that."
01:34:33.876,01:34:37.129,Children cannot be what they cannot see.
01:34:38.255,01:34:40.174,And it's not just about children.
01:34:40.716,01:34:41.884,It's about all of us.
01:34:43.052,01:34:48.099,We cannot be a better society until we see that better society.
01:34:48.182,01:34:53.062,I cannot be in the world until I see that I am in the world.
01:34:55.940,01:35:05.616,"For a long time, I was afraid to be who I am because I was taught by my parents that there's something wrong with someone like me."
01:35:05.700,01:35:14.500,"Nomi, as a character, was the first, uh, time that we had explicitly put a trans person in our writing."
01:35:14.583,01:35:19.547,She was a character that I had aspirations to being.
01:35:19.630,01:35:25.886,There's something that is funny about the magic trick of...
01:35:27.054,01:35:37.815,"creating something out of thin air, and then using that thing as, like, this handhold to pull yourself forward."
01:35:38.607,01:35:40.526,"And that's what Nomi was for me, yeah."
01:35:47.283,01:35:50.327,I'm so proud of Nomi Marks.
01:35:50.411,01:35:53.998,Her character was not defined by her transness.
01:35:54.081,01:35:55.291,You love her a lot.
01:35:59.670,01:36:03.716,transcended everything that I had ever known a relationship could be.
01:36:04.216,01:36:06.135,There's no way that I couldn't just...
01:36:07.011,01:36:10.014,This. Just every time that I think about...
01:36:16.937,01:36:17.897,"Focus, children."
01:36:19.565,01:36:22.568,It is time we remind the world who we are.
01:36:23.402,01:36:26.447,Royalty. But we should all walk it together.
01:36:26.530,01:36:29.950,"When Pose happened, I never thought in a million years that..."
01:36:30.409,01:36:31.869,our stories would be...
01:36:33.662,01:36:37.875,placed on a platform that had mainstream on top of it.
01:36:38.959,01:36:39.919,We have a challenge...
01:36:40.669,01:36:43.756,for the legendary children of the House of Abundance.
01:36:50.095,01:36:51.055,because...
01:36:51.931,01:36:53.808,they're stories that center...
01:36:55.392,01:36:59.271,Black trans women on a mainstream TV network.
01:36:59.855,01:37:02.066,This must give you some satisfaction.
01:37:02.775,01:37:03.609,You won.
01:37:03.692,01:37:09.114,"None of us win when one of us gets beat down, even someone who had the beatdown coming to them."
01:37:10.699,01:37:19.708,"by trans individuals on the show is amazing, because it felt like we were all included and people took our minds seriously."
01:37:20.292,01:37:22.837,And also being around people who are like you.
01:37:22.920,01:37:24.797,-I should join your house. -I'm just sayin'.
01:37:31.136,01:37:33.264,trans folks who are writing and producing and directing.
01:37:33.347,01:37:39.478,That really lent to the stories being really complex and being really endearing and really inspired.
01:37:39.562,01:37:42.147,"Even, like, the sex scenes... honey!"
01:37:49.488,01:37:52.324,I have ever seen a trans person have on television.
01:37:53.951,01:38:10.551,"Could have gone so horribly wrong, and so, there has to be a moment in time where, like, transmasculinity... It has to be included."
01:38:10.634,01:38:13.387,It's a part of ballroom. We are a part of that history and the culture.
01:38:26.984,01:38:35.576,"For me, I saw that HIV/AIDS, poverty, harassment, and violence are things that they were dealing with in '87 as well as today."
01:38:36.076,01:38:49.340,"And so, knowing that 26 trans people were murdered in the United States last year, almost all of them women of color, I thought it was important that we memorialize the people who... who we've learned so much from, the people who've contributed so much to our movement."
01:38:59.058,01:39:01.769,"And movies, sometimes we walk into a theater, and we wanna be changed."
01:39:02.770,01:39:06.941,"But we need this change to happen in real life, in real time."
01:39:12.321,01:39:20.287,"and that one of the creators of the show is Ryan Murphy, and I think about shows like Nip/Tuck, I get excited because I think that people can evolve."
01:39:21.080,01:39:23.332,"You know, I think about Janet Mock's interview with Oprah."
01:39:23.415,01:39:31.006,I think it's so interesting that it took you the time that it took you to become comfortable with telling your story.
01:39:31.340,01:39:34.259,That was very different than Oprah's interview with Lea T.
01:39:34.593,01:39:36.053,Lea T was born a boy.
01:39:36.136,01:39:40.474,"So, folks can evolve, and I think that a moment shifts and awareness shifts."
01:39:46.522,01:39:49.400,My outing was in the New York Times.
01:39:52.069,01:39:52.945,Whew.
01:39:53.487,01:39:54.321,Mmm.
01:39:59.118,01:40:01.412,It was... It was so frightening.
01:40:01.495,01:40:08.127,"Then I started having meetings with ABC and NBC, and, yes, Fox."
01:40:08.877,01:40:09.962,Who knew?
01:40:10.754,01:40:11.672,Who knew?
01:40:12.089,01:40:13.674,"I, for the first time..."
01:40:14.341,01:40:15.801,Here's the emotional part.
01:40:16.218,01:40:23.767,"...got to say loudly and clearly, at an audition, that I'm a trans woman."
01:40:32.192,01:40:34.778,"My mother, she's so happy, 'cause she now can breathe."
01:40:34.862,01:40:38.073,"She said, Nobody's gonna do anything to you anymore. It's all..."
01:40:38.157,01:40:39.241,It's all good.
01:40:39.700,01:40:43.620,"Well, not quite, Mom. It's, you know. Work still has to be done."
01:40:52.755,01:40:58.802,when a few people are elevated and the majority of people are still struggling.
01:41:05.142,01:41:15.235,"or the trans character on television and film, those sort of representations of transness may incite rage in a viewer."
01:41:15.527,01:41:18.280,And that viewer doesn't have access to the character.
01:41:18.363,01:41:20.574,They have access to the person on the street.
01:41:26.455,01:41:34.338,I think that makes it especially important for us to be pushing for actual material redistribution.
01:41:34.421,01:41:46.558,"Otherwise, all we're doing is elevating some people into the sphere of the powerful and not in any way working to disrupt the systems that exclude most trans people from material survival."
01:41:52.272,01:42:01.698,"There is still a lot of work to do, and we can't think that just because you see trans representation that the revolution is over."
01:42:03.575,01:42:05.410,You know. It's not.
01:42:13.669,01:42:23.428,Having positive representation can only succeed in changing the conditions of life for trans people when it is part of a much broader movement for social change.
01:42:24.721,01:42:27.432,Changing representation is not the goal.
01:42:28.517,01:42:30.936,It's just the means to an end.
01:42:36.024,01:42:46.410,"I wonder if they will reach out to trans people in need and work to defeat policies that scapegoat us, policies that discriminate against us, policies that dehumanize us."
01:42:47.035,01:42:55.836,"Because until that happens, all that energy from the silver screen won't be enough to better the lives of trans people off the screen."
