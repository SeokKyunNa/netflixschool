00:15:49.365,00:15:57.665,"As for Alan Greenspan, Reagan appointed him chairman of America's central bank, the Federal Reserve."
00:15:57.707,00:16:03.170,Greenspan was reappointed by presidents Clinton and George W. Bush.

00:16:30.030,00:16:41.375,"By the late 1990s, the financial sector had consolidated into a few gigantic firms, each of them so large that their failure could threaten the whole system."
00:16:41.417,00:16:45.171,And the Clinton administration helped them grow even larger.
00:16:45.212,00:16:53.680,"In 1998, Citicorp and Travelers merged to form Citigroup, the largest financial services company in the world."

00:17:04.941,00:17:07.902,It was illegal to acquire Travelers.

00:17:59.746,00:18:09.964,"They are very big, and therefore, you have to put in compartments to prevent the sloshing around of oil from capsizing the boat."
00:18:10.006,00:18:13.467,The design of the boat has to take that into account.
00:18:13.509,00:18:22.476,"And after the Depression, the regulations actually introduced these very watertight compartments."
00:18:22.518,00:18:28.942,And deregulation has led to the end of compartmentalization.

00:19:09.941,00:19:13.820,Analysts were being paid based on how much business they brought in.

00:19:27.750,00:19:40.721,"The defense that was proffered by many of the investment banks was not you're wrong, it was, Everybody's doing it, everybody knows it's going on."

00:23:42.671,00:23:48.468,"They could bet on the rise or fall of oil prices, the bankruptcy of a company, even the weather."
00:23:48.510,00:23:56.102,"By the late 1990s, derivatives were a 50-trillion-dollar unregulated market."

00:24:01.065,00:24:08.114,Brooksley Born graduated first in her class at Stanford Law School and was the first woman to edit a major law review.

00:27:13.215,00:27:25.478,"Dominating this industry were five investment banks, two financial conglomerates, three securities insurance companies and three rating agencies."
00:27:25.519,00:27:29.273,And linking them all together was the securitization food chain.
00:27:29.315,00:27:36.738,A new system which connected trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans with investors all over the world.
00:27:36.780,00:27:43.496,"Thirty years ago, if you went to get a loan for a home, the person lending you the money expected you to pay him or her back."
00:27:43.537,00:27:46.499,You got a loan from a lender who wanted to be paid back.
00:27:46.540,00:27:53.213,"We've since developed securitization, whereby people who make the loan are no longer at risk if they fail to repay."
00:27:53.255,00:28:00.137,"NARRATOR: In the old system, when a homeowner paid their mortgage every month, the money went to their local lender."
00:28:00.179,00:28:05.559,"And since mortgages took decades to repay, lenders were careful."
00:28:05.601,00:28:10.189,"In the new system, lenders sold mortgages to investment banks."
00:28:10.230,00:28:24.244,"The banks combined thousands of mortgages and loans, including car loans, student loans, and credit card debt, to create complex derivatives called collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs."
00:28:24.286,00:28:29.208,The investment banks then sold the CDOs to investors.
00:28:29.249,00:28:35.088,"Now when homeowners paid their mortgages, the money went to investors all over the world."
00:28:35.130,00:28:45.265,"The investment banks paid rating agencies to evaluate the CDOs, and many of them were given a triple-A rating, which is the highest possible investment grade."
00:28:45.307,00:28:52.272,"This made CDOs popular with retirement funds, which could only purchase highly rated securities."
00:28:53.815,00:28:56.902,This system was a ticking time bomb.
00:28:56.943,00:29:03.617,"Lenders didn't care anymore about whether a borrower could repay, so they started making riskier loans."
00:29:03.659,00:29:05.994,The investment banks didn't care either.
00:29:06.036,00:29:09.915,"The more CDOs they sold, the higher their profits."
00:29:09.956,00:29:18.798,"And the rating agencies, which were paid by the investment banks, had no liability if their ratings of CDOs proved wrong."
00:29:18.840,00:29:23.637,"You weren't gonna be on the hook, there weren't regulatory constraints."
00:29:23.679,00:29:26.973,So it was a green light to just pump out more and more loans.
00:29:27.015,00:29:35.274,"NARRATOR: Between 2000 and 2003, the number of mortgage loans made each year nearly quadrupled."
00:29:35.315,00:29:43.407,"Everybody in this securitization food chain, from the very beginning until the end, didn't care about the quality of the mortgage."
00:29:43.449,00:29:48.120,They were caring about maximizing their volume and getting a fee out of it.
00:29:48.161,00:29:54.752,"NARRATOR: In the early 2000s, there was a huge increase in the riskiest loans, called subprime."
00:29:54.793,00:30:04.844,"But when thousands of subprime loans were combined to create CDOs, many of them still received triple-A ratings."
00:30:04.886,00:30:19.901,"INTERVIEWER: Now, t would have been possible to create derivative products that don't have these risks, that carry the equivalent of deductibles, where there are limits on the risks that can be taken on, and so forth."

00:30:46.679,00:30:57.356,"All the incentives that the financial institutions offered to their mortgage brokers were based on selling the most profitable products, which were predatory loans."
00:30:57.397,00:31:01.777,"If they make more money, that's where they'll put you."
00:31:06.406,00:31:13.747,"NARRATOR: Suddenly, hundreds of billions of dollars a year were flowing through the securitization chain."
00:31:13.789,00:31:18.960,"Since anyone could get a mortgage, home purchases and housing prices skyrocketed."
00:31:19.002,00:31:22.922,The result was the biggest financial bubble in history.

00:38:15.543,00:38:20.673,The derivatives universe essentially enables anybody to actually insure that house.
00:38:20.715,00:38:23.342,"So you could insure that, somebody else could."
00:38:23.384,00:38:25.595,So 50 people might insure my house.
00:38:25.637,00:38:40.359,"So, what happens is, if my house burns down, now the number of losses in the system becomes proportionately larger NARRATOR: Since credit default swaps were unregulated, AIG didn't have to put aside any money to cover potential losses."
00:38:40.401,00:38:47.117,"Instead, AIG paid its employees huge cash bonuses as soon as contracts were signed."
00:38:47.159,00:38:52.538,"But if the CDOs later went bad, AIG would be on the hook."

00:40:51.991,00:40:55.494,"And the conclusion was, um, it is."
00:40:57.163,00:41:07.966,"NARRATOR: Rajan's paper focused on incentive structures that generated huge cash bonuses based on short-term profits, but which imposed no penalties for later losses."
00:41:08.007,00:41:18.476,Rajan argued that these incentives encouraged bankers to take risks that might eventually destroy their own firms or even the entire financial system.
00:41:20.812,00:41:25.317,RAJAN: It's very easy to generate performance by taking on more risk.
00:41:25.358,00:41:29.946,"So, what you need to do is compensate for risk-adjusted performance."
00:41:29.988,00:41:32.407,And that's where all the bodies are buried.
00:41:32.449,00:41:35.660,"Rajan, you know, hit the nail on the head."
00:41:35.701,00:41:43.084,What he particularly said was: You guys have claimed you've found a way to make more profits with less risk.
00:41:43.126,00:41:46.463,I say you found a way to make more profits with more risk.
00:41:46.504,00:41:48.006,There's a big difference.
00:41:48.047,00:41:50.758,Summers was vocal.
00:41:50.800,00:42:04.230,"He basically thought that I was criticizing the change in the financial world and was worried about, you know, regulation, which would reverse this change."
00:42:04.272,00:42:07.108,Essentially he accused me of being a Luddite.
00:42:07.150,00:42:16.284,He wanted to make sure that we didn't bring in a whole new set of regulations to constrain the financial sector.
00:42:20.288,00:42:27.337,"You're gonna make an extra $2 million a year, or $10 million a year, for putting your financial institution at risk."
00:42:27.379,00:42:29.630,"Someone else pays the bill, you don't."
00:42:29.672,00:42:31.257,Would you make that bet?
00:42:31.299,00:42:34.593,"Most people on Wall Street said, Sure, I'd make that bet."
00:42:38.806,00:43:18.804,Many years Since I was here On the street I was passing My time away To the left And to the right Buildings towering To the sky It's out of sight In the dead of night Ooh Here I am And in this city With a fistful Of dollars And baby You'd better believe I'm back Back in the New York groove I'm back Back in the New York groove GNAIZDA: It never was enough.
00:43:18.846,00:43:22.225,"They don't wanna own one home, they wanna own five homes."
00:43:22.267,00:43:27.813,And they wanna have an expensive penthouse on Park Avenue.
00:43:27.855,00:43:30.942,And they wanna have their own private jet.
00:43:30.983,00:43:36.448,INTERVIEWER: You think this is an industry where very high compensation levels are justified?
00:43:36.489,00:43:42.579,"I think I would take caution, or take heed, or take exception to your word very high. It's relative."
00:43:42.620,00:43:45.290,You have a 14-million-dollar home in Florida.
00:43:45.331,00:43:48.167,"You have a summer home in Sun Valley, Idaho."
00:43:48.209,00:43:51.837,An art collection filled with million-dollar paintings.
00:43:51.879,00:43:55.007,MAN: Richard Fuld never appeared on the trading floor.
00:43:55.049,00:43:57.594,There were art advisors there all the time.
00:43:57.635,00:44:01.598,He had a private elevator.
00:44:01.639,00:44:09.897,"His elevator, they hired technicians to program it so that his driver would call in in the morning and a security guard would hold it."
00:44:09.939,00:44:14.527,There's only a three-second window where he actually has to see people.
00:44:14.569,00:44:17.738,And he hops into this elevator and it goes straight to 31.
00:44:17.780,00:44:20.408,INTERVIEWER: Lehman owned corporate jets.
00:44:20.450,00:44:22.410,You know about this?
00:44:22.452,00:44:23.869,INTERVIEWER: How many?
00:44:23.911,00:44:26.581,"MILLER: Six, including the 767s."
00:44:26.623,00:44:28.541,Also had a helicopter.
00:44:28.583,00:44:31.210,INTERVIEWER: Isn't that a lot of planes?
00:44:33.921,00:44:36.382,We're dealing with type-A personalities.
00:44:36.424,00:44:38.510,They know everything in the world.
00:44:38.551,00:44:40.678,Banking became a pissing contest.
00:44:40.719,00:44:43.389,Mine's bigger than yours.
00:44:43.431,00:44:45.766,"It was all men that ran it, incidentally."
00:44:45.808,00:44:48.769,Fifty-billion-dollar deals weren't large enough.
00:44:48.811,00:44:49.895,We'd do 100.
00:44:49.937,00:44:51.688,These people are risk-takers.
00:44:51.730,00:44:52.898,They're impulsive.
00:44:58.279,00:45:01.073,"It's part of their behavior, their personality."
00:45:01.115,00:45:04.827,And that manifests outside of work as well.
00:45:04.869,00:45:09.832,"It was quite typical for the guys to go out to go to strip bars, to use drugs."
00:45:09.874,00:45:12.544,"I see a lot of cocaine use, use of prostitution."
00:45:19.634,00:45:31.604,"Neuroscientists have done experiments where they've taken individuals and put them into an MRI machine, and they have them play a game where the prize is money."
00:45:31.646,00:45:40.446,"And they noticed that when the subjects earn money, the part of the brain that gets stimulated is the same part that cocaine stimulates."
00:45:40.488,00:45:46.911,"JONATHAN: A lot of people feel they need to participate in that behavior to get promoted, get recognized."
00:45:46.952,00:45:58.130,"NARRATOR: According to a Bloomberg article, business entertainment represents 5 percent of revenue for derivatives brokers and includes strip clubs, prostitution and drugs."
00:45:58.172,00:46:08.057,A New York broker filed a lawsuit in 2007 against his firm alleging he was required to retain prostitutes to entertain traders.
00:46:08.099,00:46:13.938,"There's just a blatant disregard for the impact their actions have on society, on family."
00:46:13.979,00:46:20.111,They have no problem using a prostitute and going home to their wife.
00:46:28.994,00:46:30.996,INTERVIEWER: How many customers?
00:46:31.038,00:46:33.499,"About 10,000 at that point in time."
00:46:36.835,00:46:39.796,INTERVIEWER: What fraction were from Wall Street?
00:46:39.838,00:46:44.427,"Of the higher-end clients, probably 40 to 50 percent."
00:46:44.469,00:46:48.847,INTERVIEWER: Were all major Wall Street firms represented?
00:46:48.889,00:46:51.350,Goldman Sachs?
00:46:51.392,00:46:55.313,Morgan Stanley was a little less of that.
00:46:55.354,00:46:58.524,"I think Goldman was pretty, pretty big with that."
00:46:58.566,00:47:03.237,DAVIS: Clients would call and say: Can you get me a Lamborghini for the girl?
00:47:03.279,00:47:05.698,These guys were spending corporate money.
00:47:05.740,00:47:10.244,"I had many black cards from, you know, the various financial firms."
00:47:10.286,00:47:16.083,JONATHAN: What's happening is services are being charged to computer repair.
00:47:16.125,00:47:20.254,"Trading research, you know, consulting for market compliance."
00:47:20.296,00:47:24.133,"I just gave them letterhead and said, Make your own invoice."
00:47:24.175,00:47:28.095,INTERVIEWER: This behavior extends to the firm's senior management?
00:47:28.137,00:47:31.432,Absolutely does. Yeah.
00:47:31.474,00:47:34.352,It extends to the very top.
00:47:38.314,00:47:46.030,A friend of mine in a company that has a big financial presence said: It's about time you learned about subprime mortgages.
00:47:46.071,00:47:50.075,So he set up a session with his trading desk and me.
00:47:50.117,00:48:01.003,"And the techie who did all this gets very excited, runs to his computer, pulls up in about three seconds this Goldman Sachs issue of securities."
00:48:01.045,00:48:02.672,It was a complete disaster.
00:48:02.714,00:48:08.427,"Borrowers had borrowed, on average, 99.3 percent of the price of the house."
00:48:08.469,00:48:10.471,They have no money in the house.
00:48:10.513,00:48:13.890,"If anything goes wrong, they walk away from the mortgage."
00:48:13.932,00:48:16.811,"This is not a loan you'd really make, right?"
00:48:16.853,00:48:18.437,You've gotta be crazy.
00:48:18.479,00:48:29.657,"But somehow, you took 8000 of these loans, and by the time the guys were done at Goldman Sachs and the rating agencies, two-thirds of the loans were rated triple-A."
00:48:29.699,00:48:32.702,They were rated as safe as government securities.
00:48:32.744,00:48:34.412,It's utterly mad.
00:48:34.453,00:48:42.795,NARRATOR: Goldman Sachs sold at least $3.1 billion worth of these toxic CDOs in the first half of 2006.
00:48:42.837,00:48:49.802,"The CEO of Goldman Sachs at this time was Henry Paulson, the highest paid CEO on Wall Street."
00:48:52.096,00:48:54.306,Good morning.
00:48:52.096,00:48:58.352,I'm pleased to announce that I will nominate Henry Paulson to be the Secretary of the Treasury.
00:48:58.394,00:49:00.646,He has a lifetime of experience.
00:49:00.688,00:49:03.023,He has knowledge of financial markets.
00:49:03.065,00:49:05.984,He's earned a reputation for candor and integrity.
00:49:06.026,00:49:11.490,NARRATOR: You might think it would be hard for Paulson to adjust to a meager government salary.
00:49:11.532,00:49:16.788,But taking the job as Treasury secretary was the best financial decision of his life.
00:49:16.829,00:49:23.461,Paulson had to sell his $485 million of Goldman stock when he went to work for the government.
00:49:23.502,00:49:29.133,"But because of a law passed by the first President Bush, he didn't have to pay any taxes on it."
00:49:29.174,00:49:32.177,It saved him $50 million.
00:49:39.017,00:49:42.855,SLOAN: The article came out in October of 2007.
00:49:42.897,00:49:46.692,"Already, a third of the mortgages defaulted."
00:49:46.734,00:49:50.571,Now most of them are going.
00:49:50.613,00:50:02.374,"NARRATOR: One group that had purchased these now worthless securities was the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi, which provides monthly benefits to over 80,000 retirees."
00:50:02.416,00:50:07.839,They lost millions of dollars and are now suing Goldman Sachs.
00:50:20.518,00:50:25.564,"By late 2006, Goldman had taken things a step further."
00:50:25.606,00:50:36.534,"It didn't just sell toxic CDOs, it started actively betting against them at the same time it was telling customers that they were high-quality investments."
00:50:36.575,00:50:47.085,"By purchasing credit default swaps from AIG, Goldman could bet against CDOs it didn't own and get paid when the CDOs failed."
00:50:47.127,00:50:56.762,"I asked if anybody called the customers and said: We don't really like this kind of mortgage anymore, and we thought you ought to know."
00:50:56.804,00:51:02.601,"They didn't say anything, but you could feel the laughter coming over the phone."
00:51:02.643,00:51:08.399,NARRATOR: Goldman Sachs bought at least $22 billion of credit default swaps from AIG.
00:51:08.440,00:51:13.529,It was so much that Goldman realized that AIG itself might go bankrupt.
00:51:13.571,00:51:19.618,So they spent $150 million insuring themselves against AIG's potential collapse.
00:51:19.660,00:51:23.414,"Then in 2007, Goldman went even further."
00:51:23.455,00:51:31.422,"They started selling CDOs specifically designed so that the more money their customers lost, the more money Goldman Sachs made."
00:51:37.678,00:51:42.975,Six hundred million dollars of Timberwolf securities is what you sold.
00:51:43.017,00:51:53.652,"Before you sold them, this is what your sales team were telling to each other: Boy, that Timberwolf was one shitty deal."
00:51:53.694,00:51:59.533,"SPARKS: This was an e-mail to me in late June, after the transaction."
00:51:56.655,00:52:02.078,"And you sold Timberwolf-- No, no. You sold Timberwolf after as well."
00:52:02.118,00:52:04.080,SPARKS: We did trades after that.
00:52:04.120,00:52:08.417,"Yeah. Okay. The next e-mail-- Take a look. July 1, '07."
00:52:08.459,00:52:11.837,"--tells the sales force, The top priority is Timberwolf."
00:52:11.879,00:52:15.424,Your top priority to sell is that shitty deal.
00:52:15.466,00:52:19.887,"If you have an adverse interest to a client, do you have the duty to disclose it?"
00:52:19.929,00:52:22.431,To tell the client of your adverse interest?
00:52:22.473,00:52:25.350,That's my question.
00:52:22.473,00:52:27.686,I'm trying to understand-- LEVIN: You don't wanna answer.
00:52:27.728,00:52:35.193,Do you believe that you have a duty to act in the best interest of your clients?
00:52:35.235,00:52:44.996,"Again, I repeat, we have a duty to serve our clients by showing prices on transactions that they ask us to show prices for."
00:52:45.037,00:52:51.167,What do you think about selling securities which your own people think are crap?
00:52:51.209,00:52:53.129,Does that bother you?
00:52:53.169,00:52:55.006,BLANKFEIN: I think they would.
00:52:55.047,00:52:58.216,As a hypothetical?
00:52:58.258,00:53:01.137,"Well, then I don't know-- LEVIN: We heard it today."
00:53:01.177,00:53:04.473,We heard it today. This is a shitty deal. This is crap.
00:53:04.515,00:53:10.562,I-- I heard nothing today that makes me think anything went wrong.
00:53:10.604,00:53:24.160,"Is there not a conflict when you sell something to somebody and then are determined to bet against that same security, and you don't disclose that to the person you're selling it to?"
00:53:24.200,00:53:25.703,Do you see a problem?
00:53:25.744,00:53:28.622,"In the context of market making, that is not a conflict."
00:53:28.664,00:53:38.132,"LEVIN: When you heard your employees in e-mails said, God, what a shitty deal, God, what a piece of crap, do you feel anything?"
00:53:35.671,00:53:39.383,That's unfortunate to have on e-mail.
00:53:39.424,00:53:42.260,LEVIN: Are you embar--?
00:53:42.302,00:53:47.099,And very unfortunate-- I don't-- LEVIN: On e-mail?
00:53:47.141,00:53:50.644,It's very unfortunate for anyone to have said that in any form.
00:53:50.686,00:53:54.606,Are your competitors engaged in similar activities?
00:53:54.648,00:53:59.820,"Uh, yes, and to a greater extent than us in most cases."
00:53:59.862,00:54:05.659,NARRATOR: Hedge fund manager John Paulson made $12 billion betting against the mortgage market.
00:54:05.701,00:54:14.085,"When Paulson ran out of mortgage securities to bet against, he worked with Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank to create more."
00:54:14.126,00:54:24.929,"Morgan Stanley was also selling mortgage securities it was betting against, and it's now being sued by the Government Employees' Retirement Fund of the Virgin Islands for fraud."
00:54:24.970,00:54:29.307,The lawsuit alleges that Morgan Stanley knew that the CDOs were junk.
00:54:29.349,00:54:33.979,"Although they were rated triple-A, Morgan Stanley was betting they would fail."
00:54:34.021,00:54:42.696,"A year later, Morgan Stanley had made hundreds of millions of dollars, while the investors had lost almost all of their money."
00:54:58.629,00:55:05.803,You would have thought pension funds would have said: Those are subprime.
00:55:05.844,00:55:10.849,"They had these guys at Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's who said, That's a triple-A."
00:55:10.891,00:55:17.064,No securities got issued without the seal of approval of the rating agencies.
00:55:17.106,00:55:25.823,"NARRATOR: The three rating agencies, Moody's, S&amp;P and Fitch, made billions of dollars giving high ratings to risky securities."
00:55:25.864,00:55:33.080,"Moody's, the largest rating agency, quadrupled its profits between 2000 and 2007."
00:55:34.206,00:55:38.210,Moody's and S&amp;P get compensated based on putting out ratings reports.
00:55:38.252,00:55:43.674,"And the more structured securities they gave a triple-A rating to, the higher their earnings."
00:55:43.715,00:55:48.386,"Imagine going to The Times saying: Write a positive story, I'll pay you $500,000."
00:55:48.428,00:55:50.388,"If you don't, I'll give nothing."
00:55:50.430,00:56:01.275,"Rating agencies could have stopped the party and said: Sorry. We're gonna tighten our standards, and immediately cut off the funding to risky borrowers."
00:56:01.317,00:56:11.367,Triple-A-rated instruments mushroomed from just a handful to thousands and thousands.
00:56:11.409,00:56:18.000,"Hundreds of billions of dollars were being rated, you know, and-- INTERVIEWER: Per year?"
00:56:18.042,00:56:37.353,"I've now testified before both houses of Congress on the credit rating agency issue, and both times they trot out very prominent First Amendment lawyers and argue that, When we say something is rated triple-A, that is merely our 'opinion.' You shouldn't rely on it."
00:56:37.393,00:56:39.688,S&amp;P's ratings express our opinion.
00:56:39.730,00:56:43.108,Our ratings are our opinions.
00:56:43.150,00:56:45.527,Opinions.
00:56:45.569,00:56:50.115,I think we are emphasizing the fact that our ratings are opinions.
00:56:56.080,00:57:03.754,"They do not speak to the market value of a security, the volatility of its price, or its suitability as an investment."
00:57:22.273,00:57:27.319,"We have many economists coming on and saying: Oh. This is a bubble, it's going to burst."
00:57:27.361,00:57:29.863,This is going to be an issue for the economy.
00:57:29.905,00:57:32.950,Some say it could even cause a recession at some point.
00:57:32.991,00:57:39.998,"What is the worst-case scenario if, in fact, we were to see prices come down substantially across the country?"
00:57:40.040,00:57:43.294,I don't buy your premise.
00:57:43.335,00:57:47.839,We've never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis.

01:15:35.198,01:15:39.243,"When that property goes on the market, it'll be sold at a lower price."
01:15:39.285,01:15:42.913,"Maybe before it goes on the market, it won't be well-maintained."
01:15:42.955,01:15:46.459,We estimate 9 million homeowners will lose their homes.
01:16:50.022,01:16:54.026,The majority I've seen are people hurt by the economy.
01:16:54.068,01:16:58.489,"They were living day to day, paycheck to paycheck, and that ran out."
01:16:58.531,01:17:00.616,Unemployment won't pay a mortgage.
01:17:00.657,01:17:02.034,It won't pay a car bill.

01:17:04.495,01:17:09.459,"And they shut down the logging systems, shut down the sawmills."

01:18:26.410,01:18:29.580,The problem with boards is the way boards are elected.
01:18:29.622,01:18:33.250,"Boards are pretty much, in many cases, picked by the CEO."
01:18:33.292,01:18:41.133,The board of directors and compensation committees are the two bodies best situated to determine pay for executives.
01:18:41.175,01:18:44.928,INTERVIEWER: How do you think they've done over the past 10 years?
01:18:44.970,01:18:50.560,"If you look at those-- I would give about a B, because-- A B?"

01:19:21.798,01:19:24.801,That's a tougher one. I don't know if I'd give it a B.

01:20:05.426,01:20:16.604,I attended a very interesting dinner organized by Hank Paulson a little more than one year ago with some officials and a couple of CEOs from the biggest banks in the U.S.
01:20:16.646,01:20:24.987,"And, uh, surprisingly enough, all these gentlemen were arguing: We were too greedy, so we have part of the responsibility. Fine."
01:20:25.028,01:20:32.578,"Then they were turning to the treasurer, Secretary of the Treasury, and saying: Regulate more. We're too greedy, we can't avoid it."
01:20:32.620,01:20:35.706,The only way to avoid this is to have more regulation.
01:20:35.748,01:20:40.877,"INTERVIEWER: I have spoken to many bankers about this, including very senior ones."
01:20:40.919,01:20:49.011,And this is the first time that I've ever heard anybody say they wanted their compensation to be regulated in any way.
01:20:49.052,01:20:52.264,"Yeah, because it was at the moment where they were afraid."
01:20:52.306,01:20:59.271,"And after, when solution to the crisis began to appear, then probably they changed their mind."

01:22:02.793,01:22:07.923,That you can walk into any hearing room that you would like.

01:22:09.966,01:22:18.267,One cannot write the lobbying checks that your industry writes or engage in the level of political contributions your industry engages in.
01:22:18.308,01:22:26.983,"NARRATOR: Between 1998 and 2008, the financial industry spent over $5 billion on lobbying and campaign contributions."

01:22:31.614,01:22:39.996,"The financial industry also exerts its influence in a more subtle way, one that most Americans don't know about."
01:22:40.038,01:22:43.959,It has corrupted the study of economics itself.
01:22:44.000,01:22:54.845,Deregulation had tremendous financial and intellectual support because people argued it for their own benefit.
01:22:54.887,01:22:59.683,The economics profession was the main source of that illusion.
01:22:59.725,01:23:09.359,"Since the 1980s, academic economists have been major advocates of deregulation and played powerful roles in shaping U.S."
01:23:09.401,01:23:13.697,Very few of these economic experts warned about the crisis.
01:23:13.739,01:23:18.494,"And even after the crisis, many of them opposed reform."
01:23:18.535,01:23:24.792,The guys who taught these things tended to get paid a lot of money being consultants.
01:23:24.834,01:23:29.546,Business school professors don't live on a faculty salary.

01:23:43.894,01:23:46.647,That's kind of a lot of money.
01:23:46.689,01:23:48.941,That doesn't bother you?

01:24:52.421,01:24:54.089,I don't think so. No.
01:24:54.130,01:25:00.262,You certainly wouldn't get that impression by the drubbing that they regularly get in Washington.

01:25:35.380,01:25:40.844,"Glenn Hubbard was paid $100,000 to testify in their defense."
01:25:40.886,01:25:46.976,INTERVIEWER: Do you think the economics discipline has a conflict-of-interest problem?
01:25:47.017,01:25:48.978,I'm not sure I know what you mean.
01:25:49.019,01:25:59.279,"Do you think a significant fraction of the economics discipline, economists, have financial conflicts of interest that might call into question or color--?"
01:25:59.321,01:26:01.406,I see what you're saying.
01:26:01.448,01:26:06.745,Most academic economists aren't wealthy business people.

01:27:55.020,01:28:04.613,"And that was the mistake, that it turns out prudential regulation and supervision was not strong in Iceland during this period-- What led you to think it was?"
01:28:04.654,01:28:14.123,"You're going with the information you had and generally, the view was that Iceland had very good institutions."
01:28:10.869,01:28:16.583,It was an advanced country-- Who told you that?
01:28:16.625,01:28:22.714,"You talk to people. You have faith in the central bank, which actually did fall down on the job."
01:28:22.756,01:28:27.219,That clearly it-- This-- Why have faith in a central bank?
01:28:27.261,01:28:31.431,"Well, that faith-- You try-- Because you go with the information you have."

01:28:56.539,01:29:06.049,What should be publicly available is whenever anybody does research on a topic that they disclose if they have any financial conflict with that research.
01:29:06.091,01:29:10.595,"INTERVIEWER: But if I recall, there is no policy to that effect."
01:29:10.637,01:29:15.391,I can't imagine anybody not doing that in terms of putting it in a paper.
01:29:15.433,01:29:20.022,There would be significant professional sanction for failure to do that.

01:31:04.584,01:31:14.386,Looks to me as if the majority of your outside activities are consulting and directorship arrangements with the financial services industry.
01:31:14.428,01:31:17.139,Would you not agree with that?
01:31:14.428,01:31:19.849,"To my knowledge, I don't think my consulting clients are on my CV."
01:31:19.891,01:31:22.936,So I wouldn't know.
01:31:22.978,01:31:25.147,I don't have to discuss that with you.

01:31:36.992,01:31:40.287,And-- But I do not wanna go into details about that.
01:31:40.329,01:31:43.957,INTERVIEWER: Do they include other financial services firms?
01:31:43.999,01:31:46.042,Possibly.
01:31:46.084,01:31:47.752,"This isn't a deposition, sir."

01:32:38.512,01:32:45.018,Turns out doctor makes 80 percent of personal income from manufacture of this drug.
01:32:45.060,01:32:50.273,"I think it's certainly important to disclose the, um..."

01:32:54.986,01:33:02.077,"Well, I think that's also a little different from cases that we're talking about here because, um..."
01:33:03.537,01:33:05.163,Um...
01:33:16.550,01:33:25.058,"INTERVIEWER: So, what do you think this says about the economics discipline?"
01:33:25.100,01:33:33.442,"And, indeed, I think it's a part of the-- It's an important part of the problem."
01:33:47.456,01:33:53.253,NARRATOR: The rising power of the U.S. financial sector was part of a wider change in America.
01:33:54.588,01:34:03.513,"Since the 1980s, the United States has become a more unequal society, and its economic dominance has declined."
01:34:03.555,01:34:16.276,"Companies like General Motors, Chrysler and U.S. Steel, formerly the core of the U.S. economy, were poorly managed and falling behind their foreign competitors."
01:34:16.318,01:34:23.866,"And as countries like China opened their economies, American companies sent jobs overseas to save money."
01:34:25.535,01:34:35.669,"For many, many years, the 660 million people in the developed world were sheltered from all of this additional labor that existed on the planet."
01:34:35.711,01:34:42.051,Suddenly the Bamboo Curtain and the Iron Curtain are lifted and you have 2.5 billion additional people.
01:34:42.093,01:34:46.431,NARRATOR: American factory workers were laid off by the tens of thousands.
01:34:46.473,01:34:51.019,"Our manufacturing base was destroyed, literally, over a few years."
01:34:51.060,01:34:55.482,"NARRATOR: As manufacturing declined, other industries rose."
01:34:55.524,01:35:02.197,"The United States leads the world in information technology, where high-paying jobs are easy to find."
01:35:02.238,01:35:04.533,But those jobs require an education.
01:35:04.574,01:35:09.579,"And for average Americans, college is increasingly out of reach."
01:35:09.621,01:35:20.340,"While top private universities like Harvard have billions of dollars in their endowments, funding for public universities is shrinking and tuition is rising."
01:35:20.382,01:35:30.308,"Tuition for California's public universities rose from $650 in the 1970s to over $10,000 in 2010."
01:35:30.350,01:35:38.149,"Increasingly, the most important determinant of whether Americans go to college is whether they can find the money to pay for it."
01:35:38.191,01:35:43.279,"Meanwhile, American tax policy shifted to favor the wealthy."
01:35:43.321,01:35:48.660,"When I first came to office, I thought taxes were too high, and they were."
01:35:48.702,01:35:58.461,"The most dramatic change was a series of tax cuts designed by Glenn Hubbard, who was serving as President Bush's chief economic advisor."
01:35:58.503,01:36:05.510,"The Bush administration sharply reduced taxes on investment gains, stock dividends, and eliminated the estate tax."
01:36:05.552,01:36:15.103,"We had a comprehensive plan that, when acted, has left nearly $1.1 trillion in the hands of American workers, families, investors and small-business owners."
01:36:15.144,01:36:21.651,NARRATOR: Most of the benefits of these tax cuts went to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.
01:36:21.693,01:36:26.822,"And by the way, it was really the cornerstone in many ways, of our economic recovery policy."
01:36:26.864,01:36:33.413,NARRATOR: Inequality of wealth in the United States is now higher than in any other developed country.
01:36:33.455,01:36:42.796,American families responded to these changes in two ways: By working longer hours and by going into debt.
01:36:42.838,01:36:54.100,"As the middle class falls further and further behind, there is a political urge to respond by making it easier to get credit."
01:36:54.142,01:36:56.770,You don't have to have a lousy home.
01:36:56.810,01:37:02.609,The low-income home buyer can have just as nice a house as anybody else.
01:37:02.651,01:37:12.494,"NARRATOR: American families borrowed to finance their homes, their cars, their healthcare and their children's educations."
01:37:12.535,01:37:19.542,People in the bottom 90 percent lost ground between 1980 and 2007.
01:37:19.584,01:37:24.255,It all went to the top 1 percent.
01:37:25.674,01:37:34.140,"NARRATOR: For the first time in history, average Americans have less education and are less prosperous than their parents."
01:37:36.309,01:37:48.904,The era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street and in Washington has led us to a financial crisis as serious as any that we've faced since the Great Depression.
01:37:48.946,01:37:59.873,"NARRATOR: When the financial crisis struck before the 2008 election, Barack Obama pointed to Wall Street greed and regulatory failures as examples of the need for change in America."
01:37:59.915,01:38:06.422,A lack of oversight in Washington and on Wall Street is exactly what got us into this mess.
01:38:06.464,01:38:10.926,"After taking office, Obama spoke of the need to reform the industry."
01:38:10.968,01:38:14.347,"We want a risk regulator, increased capital requirements."
01:38:14.389,01:38:17.141,We need a consumer financial protection agency.
01:38:17.183,01:38:19.644,We need to change Wall Street's culture.
01:38:19.686,01:38:25.650,"But when finally enacted in mid-2010, the administration's financial reforms were weak."
01:38:25.692,01:38:34.826,"And in some critical areas, including the rating agencies, lobbying and compensation, nothing significant was even proposed."
01:38:34.868,01:38:43.292,"Addressing Obama and, quote, regulatory reform, my response, if it was one word, would be ha."
01:38:43.334,01:38:46.128,There's very little reform.
01:38:46.170,01:38:48.715,INTERVIEWER: How come?
01:38:48.757,01:38:51.133,It's a Wall Street government.
01:38:53.219,01:38:56.930,NARRATOR: Obama chose Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary.
01:38:56.972,01:39:07.941,"Geithner was president of the New York Federal Reserve during the crisis, and a key player in the decision to pay Goldman Sachs 100 cents on the dollar for its bets against mortgages."
01:39:07.983,01:39:16.785,"When Tim Geithner was testifying to be confirmed as Treasury secretary he said, I have never been a regulator."
01:39:16.826,01:39:21.414,Now that said to me he did not understand his job as president of the New York Fed.
01:39:25.126,01:39:34.968,"NARRATOR: The new president of the New York Fed is William C. Dudley, the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs, whose paper with Glenn Hubbard praised derivatives."
01:39:35.010,01:39:39.849,"Geithner's chief of staff is Mark Patterson, a former lobbyist for Goldman."
01:39:39.891,01:39:49.692,"And one of the senior advisors is Lewis Sachs, who oversaw Tricadia, a company heavily involved in betting against the mortgage securities it was selling."
01:39:49.734,01:39:59.452,"To head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Obama picked Gary Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs executive who had helped ban the regulation of derivatives."
01:39:59.494,01:40:09.712,"To run the Securities and Exchange Commission, Obama picked Mary Schapiro, the former CEO of FINRA, the investment banking industry's self-regulation body."
01:40:09.754,01:40:17.178,"Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, made $320,000 serving on the board of Freddie Mac."
01:40:17.219,01:40:23.852,Both Martin Feldstein and Laura Tyson are members of Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board.
01:40:23.893,01:40:28.481,And Obama's chief economic advisor is Larry Summers.
01:40:28.523,01:40:34.278,"SPITZER: The most senior economic advisors are the people who were there, who built the structure."
01:40:43.913,01:40:51.086,NARRATOR: The Obama administration resisted regulation of bank compensation even as foreign leaders took action.
01:40:51.128,01:40:53.756,The financial industry is a service industry.
01:40:53.798,01:40:57.134,It should serve others before it serves itself.
01:40:57.176,01:41:14.360,"In September of 2009, Christine Lagarde and the finance ministers of Sweden, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain and Germany called for the G20 nations, including the United States, to impose strict regulations on bank compensation."
01:41:14.402,01:41:20.658,"And in July of 2010, the European Parliament enacted those very regulations."
01:41:20.700,01:41:24.161,The Obama administration had no response.
01:41:24.203,01:41:28.374,Their view is it's a temporary blip and things will go back to normal.
01:41:28.416,01:41:35.088,"That is why I am reappointing him as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Thank you, Ben."
01:41:35.130,01:41:39.010,"NARRATOR: In 2009, Barack Obama reappointed Ben Bernanke."
01:41:39.052,01:41:41.637,"Thank you, Mr. President."
01:41:41.679,01:41:49.020,"As of mid-2010, not a single senior financial executive had been criminally prosecuted, or even arrested."
01:41:49.062,01:41:51.773,No special prosecutor had been appointed.
01:41:51.814,01:41:57.946,Not a single firm had been prosecuted criminally for securities fraud or accounting fraud.
01:41:57.987,01:42:06.621,The Obama administration has made no attempt to recover any of the compensation given to financial executives during the bubble.
01:42:06.662,01:42:14.169,"I certainly would think of criminal action against some of Countrywide's top leaders, like Mozilo."
01:42:14.211,01:42:20.133,"I'd certainly look at Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch."
01:42:20.175,01:42:23.136,INTERVIEWER: For criminal prosecutions?
01:42:23.178,01:42:32.354,"Yes. They'd be very hard to win, but I think they could do it if they got enough underlings to tell the truth."
01:42:32.396,01:42:45.034,"NARRATOR: In an industry in which drug use, prostitution and billing of prostitutes as a business expense occur on an industrial scale, it wouldn't be hard to make people talk if you really wanted to."
01:42:45.076,01:42:48.454,They gave me a plea bargain and I took it.
01:42:48.496,01:42:51.332,They were not interested in my records.
01:42:51.373,01:42:54.043,INTERVIEWER: Not interested in your records?
01:42:54.085,01:42:56.629,That's correct.
01:42:56.671,01:43:06.305,"There's a sensibility that you don't use people's personal vices in the context of Wall Street cases, necessarily, to get them to flip."
01:43:06.347,01:43:12.145,"I think maybe it's after the cataclysms that we've been through, people will reevaluate."
01:43:12.185,01:43:16.941,I'm not the one to pass judgment on that right now.
01:43:28.661,01:43:37.962,"CAPUANO: You come to us today telling us, We're sorry, we didn't mean it."
01:43:38.004,01:43:43.968,"Well, I have some people in my constituency that actually robbed some of your banks."
01:43:44.010,01:43:46.012,And they say the same thing.
01:43:46.054,01:43:49.390,They're sorry. They didn't mean it. They won't do it again.
01:43:49.431,01:44:01.610,"NARRATOR: In 2009, as unemployment hit its highest level in 17 years, Morgan Stanley paid its employees over $14 billion, and Goldman Sachs paid out over $16 billion."
01:44:01.652,01:44:05.614,"In 2010, bonuses were even higher."
01:44:05.656,01:44:15.457,"Why should a financial engineer, uh, be paid four times to 100 times more than a real engineer?"
01:44:15.499,01:44:17.835,A real engineer build bridges.
01:44:17.877,01:44:21.422,A financial engineer build dreams.
01:44:21.463,01:44:27.136,"And, you know, when those dreams turn out to be nightmares, other people pay for it."
01:44:29.222,01:44:34.810,"NARRATOR: For decades, the American financial system was stable and safe."
01:44:34.852,01:44:36.896,But then something changed.
01:44:36.938,01:44:46.155,"The financial industry turned its back on society, corrupted our political system and plunged the world economy into crisis."
01:44:48.032,01:44:53.537,"At enormous cost, we've avoided disaster and are recovering."
01:44:53.579,01:45:00.293,"But the men and institutions that caused the crisis are still in power, and that needs to change."
01:45:00.335,01:45:08.052,"They will tell us that we need them, and that what they do is too complicated for us to understand."
01:45:08.094,01:45:10.512,They will tell us it won't happen again.
01:45:10.554,01:45:14.391,They will spend billions fighting reform.
01:45:14.433,01:45:17.686,It won't be easy.
01:45:17.728,01:45:21.565,But some things are worth fighting for.
01:45:41.169,01:48:29.253,Dead in the water It's not a paid vacation The sons and daughters Of city officials Attend demonstrations It's hardly A sink or swim When all is well If the ticket sells Out with a whimper It's not A blaze of glory You look down From your temple As people endeavor To make it a story And chisel a marble word But all is lost If it's never heard But I've got someone To make reports That tell me How my money's spent To book my stays And draw my blinds So I can't tell What's really there And all I need's a great big Congratulations I'll keep your dreams You pay attention for me As strange as it seems I'd rather dissolve Than have you ignore me The ground May be moving fast But I tied my boots To a broken mast The difference is clear You throw it In your cauldron Rust and veneer Dusk and dawn Steinways and Baldwins You start with a simple stock Of all the waste And salt to taste But damn my luck And damn these friends That keep on combing back Their smiles I save my grace With half-assed guilt.
