00:01:17.118,00:01:24.417,"I guess I wouldn't believe the story if someone else were telling it, but I'm telling it and it's true, every word of it."
00:01:25.335,00:01:34.969,"It started when I was born, 56 years ago, but the real story began when I was 19 years old, when I went to college."
00:01:44.020,00:01:45.271,It was 1980.
00:01:45.355,00:01:52.028,"It was the first day of school at Sullivan County Community College up in the Catskills, about 110 miles from where I grew up."
00:01:52.112,00:01:54.197,So I drove up there alone.
00:02:02.205,00:02:03.498,It was a Volvo.
00:02:03.581,00:02:07.001,And it was a 1970 Volvo.
00:02:07.794,00:02:09.838,"Had like 130,000 miles on it."
00:02:09.921,00:02:12.715,And the car was burgundy and the hood was green.
00:02:12.799,00:02:15.051,"Actually, the car was called the Old Bitch."
00:02:20.515,00:02:23.017,But the Old Bitch got me there.
00:02:24.519,00:02:26.771,Sullivan was a community college.
00:02:27.605,00:02:30.942,This wasn't some long-standing institution of higher learning.
00:02:31.776,00:02:34.863,All these station wagons are dropping kids off.
00:02:35.363,00:02:37.699,I was nervous. I'd just gotten to the school.
00:02:37.782,00:02:40.118,I didn't know anybody. I was a freshman.
00:02:41.911,00:02:48.376,"I was never the captain of the football team in high school, so I was never really, like, popular."
00:02:51.462,00:02:55.466,"So I'm walking around, trying to find where my dorm is."
00:02:55.550,00:02:59.095,"Meanwhile, all these people are coming up to me saying, Hi. How are you?"
00:03:04.934,00:03:07.937,How was your summer? Mine was great. How was yours? Super.
00:03:08.021,00:03:09.981,Why are they asking me how my summer was? I don't know.
00:03:12.400,00:03:14.569,Everybody's being extremely friendly to me.
00:03:14.652,00:03:15.945,And they're going out of their way to do it.
00:03:16.029,00:03:17.739,I don't mean just a hi.
00:03:17.822,00:03:20.158,"I mean, claps on the back and high fives."
00:03:22.660,00:03:28.958,And I was a little bit bewildered by this because no one gets this kind of a welcome their first day at school.
00:03:30.501,00:03:36.341,"And girls were kissing me, like fully kissing me, saying, I'm so glad you came back."
00:03:36.424,00:03:41.346,"And I was saying, Thank you. And Hello back, but I had never been there before and I didn't know them."
00:03:42.597,00:03:43.806,It was bizarre.
00:03:43.890,00:03:48.645,"And the next thing I heard from right behind me, Welcome back, Eddy."
00:03:50.438,00:03:52.732,"Eddy, how are you? Eddy, hi."
00:03:52.815,00:03:55.193,"I'm like, My name's not Eddy. I don't know what you're talking about."
00:03:55.276,00:03:56.694,I just got up here.
00:03:56.778,00:03:59.280,"Sure, Eddy. You're really funny. You're really funny. Real funny."
00:03:59.364,00:04:01.324,I'm like I'm not Eddy. I don't know who Eddy is.
00:04:03.243,00:04:04.827,"Welcome back, Eddy, they were all saying."
00:04:07.080,00:04:10.750,I'd finally made it to this dump of a dorm room.
00:04:12.460,00:04:14.712,And before a minute had gone by...
00:04:17.757,00:04:19.717,Who now is gonna come to find Eddy?
00:04:19.801,00:04:25.431,"I had been at college the previous year with Eddy, and I knew that he wasn't coming back to school."
00:04:27.934,00:04:32.855,"As soon as this guy turned around, I... I was... I was actually shaking."
00:04:32.939,00:04:38.444,I was... I know all color from my face dropped 'cause I knew it was his double.
00:04:38.820,00:04:44.617,"He had the same grin, the same hair, the same expressions."
00:04:44.701,00:04:47.078,It was his double.
00:04:47.203,00:04:50.373,"And I see this guy's face, and he's like..."
00:04:52.375,00:04:54.043,Just standing there.
00:04:54.627,00:04:58.840,"The first thing out of my mouth was, Were you adopted?"
00:04:59.674,00:05:01.843,"And I was like, Yes."
00:05:01.926,00:05:05.221,"I said, Is your birthday July 12?"
00:05:05.346,00:05:06.431,"He said, Yes."
00:05:06.514,00:05:09.100,"I was like, July 12, 1961."
00:05:09.183,00:05:11.311,"Oh, my God. I said, You're not gonna believe this."
00:05:11.394,00:05:13.855,"I said, You have a twin brother. You have a twin."
00:05:16.107,00:05:17.358,"Oh, my God."
00:05:18.651,00:05:19.736,"I said, Come with me."
00:05:23.740,00:05:26.534,"And the two of us are crammed into this phone booth, shoulder to shoulder."
00:05:26.617,00:05:29.078,"And, you know, we just, like, closed the door of the phone booth."
00:05:31.789,00:05:36.669,"And I'm trying to put the coins in, and they keep falling on the floor, and Bobby's picking up the coins."
00:05:39.589,00:05:43.176,"And he calls this guy, and he's like, Hey, Eddy, you're not gonna believe this. You're not gonna believe this."
00:05:43.259,00:05:44.886,"Eddy, Eddy, you're not gonna believe this."
00:05:44.969,00:05:48.056,This guy's more hysterical than I am. Like weirded out.
00:05:48.139,00:05:49.766,"Eddy, you're not gonna believe this."
00:05:49.849,00:05:51.267,"So I was like, Give me the phone."
00:05:51.350,00:05:52.769,"So I said, Hi, Eddy. Yes?"
00:05:55.688,00:05:58.066,"But it was my voice that said, Yes?"
00:05:58.775,00:06:05.740,"And I said, Hi, Eddy. My name is Robert Shafran, and, um, I'm meeting all these people who say I'm you."
00:06:05.823,00:06:08.326,"And he said, Uh-huh. Yeah, I've been getting some calls."
00:06:08.409,00:06:11.746,"I said, Were you adopted? He said, Yes."
00:06:11.829,00:06:14.582,"And I said, When was your birthday?"
00:06:14.665,00:06:16.084,July 12.
00:06:16.417,00:06:18.544,"And I said, Do you know what the name of the agency was?"
00:06:18.628,00:06:20.463,"And he said, No. Hold on."
00:06:23.591,00:06:25.218,"And I heard him go like, Mom?"
00:06:27.178,00:06:30.306,"And he came back and said, Louise Wise Services."
00:06:33.267,00:06:38.106,"Sometimes, when you are just having a dream and you know this can't be real... This can't be real!"
00:06:38.189,00:06:41.609,"But you know there's nothing you can do to stop it, start it, change it."
00:06:41.692,00:06:43.611,"You just go with it, and that's what I was doing."
00:06:43.694,00:06:45.780,I just wanted to see what was gonna happen next.
00:06:46.906,00:06:49.408,"And I'm like, Let's go. Let's go meet Eddy."
00:06:51.994,00:06:53.788,So we got into the Old Bitch.
00:06:58.126,00:07:01.420,"It was about nine o'clock at night, and it's about a two-hour ride."
00:07:01.504,00:07:04.465,And we were speeding on Route 17.
00:07:06.676,00:07:09.220,"We were going a hundred miles per hour, perhaps more."
00:07:09.303,00:07:10.721,We were speeding.
00:07:12.098,00:07:13.724,We're driving as fast as this car would go.
00:07:13.808,00:07:14.809,It was shaking.
00:07:17.103,00:07:19.689,And we got pulled over by a New York state trooper.
00:07:25.903,00:07:32.910,"And as I roll down my window, there's this gigantic cop with, like, the sunglasses, even though it's nighttime, and the big hat."
00:07:32.994,00:07:37.165,"He said, You know, I clocked you at 88 in a 50."
00:07:37.248,00:07:40.001,"Son, you better have a really good reason."
00:07:40.084,00:07:43.546,"And I was like, Well, Officer, you're never gonna believe this."
00:07:43.629,00:07:46.924,"The two of us are, like, yelling at this guy."
00:07:47.008,00:07:50.011,You don't know! This guy... This guy has a twin brother.
00:07:50.094,00:07:52.805,"He was adopted, and we're going to Long Island to go see..."
00:07:52.889,00:07:56.058,"And the guy was, Yeah, right."
00:07:56.142,00:07:58.811,Yeah. Here's your ticket. Have a good day.
00:08:13.075,00:08:14.577,But it's like the middle of the night.
00:08:16.329,00:08:18.873,And it's this really quiet neighborhood.
00:08:22.210,00:08:26.881,So we get out of the car and I walked up this little path to the house.
00:08:28.424,00:08:30.259,The lights were on in the house.
00:08:34.889,00:08:39.560,"And I reached out to knock on the door, and as I reached out to knock on the door, it opens."
00:08:48.694,00:08:50.613,And here I am.
00:08:52.031,00:08:56.661,"His eyes are my eyes, and my eyes are his eyes, and it's true."
00:09:01.541,00:09:04.335,They're duplicates of each other.
00:09:04.418,00:09:06.963,There was no doubt in my mind that they were twins.
00:09:07.046,00:09:09.966,"He's going, Oh, my God. I'm going, Oh, my God."
00:09:10.049,00:09:13.302,"He's going, Holy crap. I'm going, Holy crap."
00:09:13.386,00:09:15.555,They just looked at each other and they moved.
00:09:15.638,00:09:22.603,"Every time Bobby moved his head, Eddy moved, And then Eddy would move and then Bobby would move."
00:09:22.687,00:09:26.315,Like they were looking at a mirror. It was the weirdest thing.
00:09:32.446,00:09:34.031,And it was just me and Eddy.
00:09:41.581,00:09:43.874,And it's the middle of a busy day.
00:09:44.625,00:09:48.629,We got a call from somebody who says they have an amazing story to tell us.
00:09:48.713,00:09:50.923,We're not gonna believe this story.
00:09:51.465,00:09:54.885,"And my first reaction, Ah, it's a hoax."
00:09:54.969,00:09:58.347,"So I told our reporter, I want to rent a plane."
00:09:58.889,00:10:00.891,"In those days, we had enough money to do this."
00:10:00.975,00:10:02.727,I want to rent a plane.
00:10:02.810,00:10:06.564,I want to see these two kids face-to-face or I don't believe this.
00:10:09.567,00:10:15.865,"We flew the journalist up to Sullivan Community College, and he called me, and he said, Howie, it's true. It's true."
00:10:17.325,00:10:18.993,"And I remember saying, Oh, my God."
00:10:19.076,00:10:20.745,This is a great story.
00:10:22.038,00:10:25.249,"This is a memorable, heartwarming story."
00:10:26.167,00:10:29.253,And then the story went from being amazing to incredible.
00:10:29.337,00:10:31.797,Okay? From amazing to incredible.
00:10:40.389,00:10:42.224,Quite late at night.
00:10:42.850,00:10:53.778,Read an article about two boys who found each other that were twins separated at birth and found each other at Sullivan County Community College.
00:10:53.861,00:10:56.572,"There was no picture, but the story was fascinating."
00:10:59.617,00:11:03.079,I came home and went to sleep.
00:11:04.330,00:11:09.585,"My mother came into the room and said, Wake up, wake up. I have to show you something."
00:11:09.669,00:11:11.879,And she shows me a newspaper...
00:11:14.006,00:11:16.175,With a picture of two boys.
00:11:16.550,00:11:21.055,"And I had to, like, focus, and I looked at the photograph and I said, Is that David?"
00:11:22.390,00:11:26.268,"And she's like, No, but look at the hands."
00:11:29.480,00:11:32.441,"And I was like, Holy mackerel."
00:11:32.525,00:11:34.026,This is beyond amazing.
00:11:34.110,00:11:38.864,"There was a picture in the newspaper of two guys, in the Post."
00:11:38.948,00:11:41.826,"And I picked up the picture, and I looked at it."
00:11:41.909,00:11:49.917,"And I was, like, in shock, 'cause the two guys in the Post look exactly, exactly like my friend David."
00:11:50.668,00:11:52.253,I stared at it.
00:11:52.336,00:11:54.296,And it wasn't even just the look on their face.
00:11:54.380,00:11:56.215,It was the way they were holding their hands.
00:11:58.509,00:12:03.639,"They have these big, meaty hands, and David always had these hands that looked like baseball mitts."
00:12:03.722,00:12:05.307,And when I saw their hands...
00:12:06.851,00:12:09.186,I just knew that this is David.
00:12:18.529,00:12:20.698,"I got to school, ran into my buddy, Alan."
00:12:20.781,00:12:23.659,"He said, David, take a look at this."
00:12:23.742,00:12:25.953,And he's got a copy of the New York Post.
00:12:26.036,00:12:28.372,"And, um, he opens it up."
00:12:28.456,00:12:31.667,"He says, Look at this. Look familiar? Something to that effect."
00:12:36.422,00:12:39.049,But then we looked at it a little bit more closely.
00:12:42.553,00:12:46.974,"It was an article. It said, Twins reunited after more than 19 years."
00:12:47.057,00:12:50.394,And it had a picture of two of what looked like me.
00:12:52.813,00:12:54.815,It all started to sink in.
00:12:55.983,00:12:58.736,"Holy shit. Oh, my God."
00:12:59.153,00:13:02.740,Do you... Do... This is not believable. This is unbelievable.
00:13:02.823,00:13:05.868,Wow. This... This is big. This is serious.
00:13:05.951,00:13:08.579,This is just not some kind of crazy coincidence.
00:13:09.163,00:13:11.457,This is not a minor resemblance.
00:13:11.540,00:13:14.919,"This is real. This is happening. This is really, really serious."
00:13:17.171,00:13:19.298,I ditched classes and got home.
00:13:19.381,00:13:22.551,My mother was waiting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee.
00:13:22.635,00:13:25.429,"And I said, Mom, you see this? She said, You see this?"
00:13:25.513,00:13:28.098,And we kind of exchanged newspapers.
00:13:28.182,00:13:31.310,"It had, Born in Long Island Jewish Hospital."
00:13:31.393,00:13:33.604,"July 12, 1961."
00:13:34.063,00:13:36.941,And it was Louise Wise Adoption Agency.
00:13:37.858,00:13:40.653,"I mean, I always knew growing up that I was adopted."
00:13:40.736,00:13:42.321,My parents were always open about it.
00:13:42.404,00:13:48.285,"But it said Eddy Galland of New Hyde Park, Long Island, Robert Shafran of Scarsdale, New York."
00:13:48.369,00:13:52.706,"I remember it said, Son of prominent Scarsdale physician, Mort Shafran."
00:13:52.790,00:13:55.000,"And, uh, my first thought..."
00:13:57.086,00:13:59.588,This SOB's probably driving a Benz.
00:14:06.804,00:14:08.806,"We were, like, really nervous."
00:14:09.265,00:14:11.850,"I mean, we were, you know, jumping around."
00:14:11.934,00:14:14.895,"You know, we were 19 years old. I mean, this was surreal."
00:14:15.563,00:14:17.273,And David picked up the phone.
00:14:18.607,00:14:22.903,"And he called information, and he reached Eddy's mom."
00:14:23.362,00:14:25.239,"And I said, Hi. Is Eddy home?"
00:14:25.322,00:14:27.575,"She says, No. Who's calling, please?"
00:14:28.158,00:14:31.161,"And I thought, Okay, now I gotta go into this whole thing on the phone."
00:14:31.245,00:14:45.259,"I said, Well, my name is David Kellman, and I was born July 12, 1961, and I'm looking at a newspaper, and, uh, basically, I think I'm looking at two of me."
00:14:45.426,00:14:47.219,I think I might be the third.
00:14:47.303,00:14:50.306,"And I think she dropped the phone, actually."
00:14:50.389,00:14:53.767,And I remember hearing her voice over the phone.
00:14:53.851,00:14:55.936,"Oh, my God. They're coming out of the woodwork."
00:15:08.866,00:15:14.580,"The first time that the boys met together, the three together, was at my house."
00:15:14.663,00:15:18.334,And the three of them ended up like puppies wrestling on the floor.
00:15:19.585,00:15:22.087,It was the most incredible...
00:15:23.672,00:15:27.009,It was the most incredible thing. They belong to each other.
00:15:28.886,00:15:30.471,They knew each other.
00:15:30.554,00:15:32.681,There was no formal introduction.
00:15:33.182,00:15:39.813,"I mean, when you meet somebody for the first time, you don't end up rolling around on the floor with them."
00:15:40.564,00:15:44.401,It was truly not fully believable.
00:15:44.485,00:15:46.528,"Even though it was happening, it was still surreal."
00:15:46.612,00:15:48.280,You think you're dreaming.
00:15:48.364,00:15:51.033,"You're looking. You're still, Oh, my God."
00:15:51.116,00:15:52.785,"You're looking the other way. Oh, my God."
00:15:52.868,00:15:56.664,And then you realize that they're looking at you or everybody else is looking at you too.
00:15:56.747,00:16:03.045,"To have all three of them in the house at one time, it was really madness."
00:16:08.175,00:16:09.551,I mean...
00:16:10.636,00:16:12.763,I can't... I can't explain it.
00:16:12.846,00:16:15.099,I haven't got the terminology.
00:16:19.353,00:16:22.147,"and said, You're not gonna believe this."
00:16:22.231,00:16:25.484,You are not gonna believe the call we just got.
00:16:26.026,00:16:28.529,You know the two kids on the front page today?
00:16:28.612,00:16:30.072,"Well, there's a third."
00:16:31.365,00:16:33.575,They even moved the same way.
00:16:36.328,00:16:40.958,All of just sat back and watched three separate lives...
00:16:41.625,00:16:42.751,Becoming one.
00:16:44.962,00:16:53.554,The way I put it was I look more like Eddy than I did David and more like David than I did Eddy and more like either of them than they did like each other.
00:16:53.804,00:16:55.514,Does that make sense?
00:17:04.189,00:17:06.734,And then we started comparing notes.
00:17:07.151,00:17:08.986,What do 19-year-olds compare?
00:17:11.363,00:17:16.785,"Booze, cigarettes, food, women, music, cars."
00:17:16.869,00:17:20.664,"And I had just bought a brand new Mercury Capri, which I loved."
00:17:20.748,00:17:31.508,"And Bobby had this maroon, beat-up old Volvo with cracked leather seats, Son of prominent Scarsdale physician, huh?"
00:17:38.348,00:17:42.686,I don't know if this will turn out to be great or terrible.
00:17:44.021,00:17:51.445,"So there was always a question mark, a big question mark, about where this story eventually was going."
00:17:52.154,00:17:57.993,We didn't realize from then on just how much things were gonna change.
00:17:58.535,00:18:00.329,"Now, one of the most remarkable stories I've seen in some time."
00:18:00.412,00:18:01.705,A story about triplets.
00:18:08.754,00:18:12.382,We have a story about triplets that gives new meaning to the phrase long-lost brothers.
00:18:14.426,00:18:17.888,We went on everything. Everything.
00:18:17.971,00:18:21.183,"You're not seeing double. You are, perhaps, in a moment going to be seeing triple."
00:18:21.266,00:18:22.476,I don't know who's who here.
00:18:22.559,00:18:24.394,"Come on out here, gentlemen. Come on out."
00:18:26.897,00:18:30.192,You just had to stop what you're doing and watch them on every different show.
00:18:35.322,00:18:38.367,"Talk about viral. I mean, it was viral even then."
00:18:38.450,00:18:41.120,You guys have been on the front page of every newspaper in the world.
00:18:47.167,00:18:50.003,Even the New York Times. Good Housekeeping.
00:18:52.506,00:18:54.758,"David, let's begin with you. Which one's David? I keep forgetting."
00:18:54.842,00:18:56.135,-You're Edward. -Right.
00:18:56.218,00:18:57.803,-Okay. Who are you? You're David. -I'm Bob.
00:18:59.721,00:19:01.223,Robert and Edward.
00:19:06.937,00:19:09.231,It was a fairy-tale story.
00:19:10.774,00:19:14.111,And people need to hear wonderful things.
00:19:14.278,00:19:19.324,"These three young men, they're all seated in the same position."
00:19:21.827,00:19:24.621,It was kind of amazing. They really were strangers.
00:19:24.705,00:19:27.416,"They looked identical to each other, but they were strangers. Right?"
00:19:27.499,00:19:29.293,"You know, they really didn't know one another."
00:19:29.751,00:19:32.504,But their behaviors were so similar.
00:19:32.588,00:19:35.090,Our lives are parallel to a phenomenal degree.
00:19:35.174,00:19:37.050,It's... It's ridiculous.
00:19:37.134,00:19:38.135,We're all the same.
00:19:38.218,00:19:40.929,As soon as we started discussing our personalities-- Personalities are the same.
00:19:41.013,00:19:42.639,-Our gestures are the same. -We always talk at the same time.
00:19:42.723,00:19:45.726,"-I'll start a sentence, he'll finish it. -We all like Chinese food."
00:19:48.187,00:19:49.354,You all smoke the same brand of cigarettes?
00:19:50.564,00:19:53.650,-What kind of cigarettes do you smoke? -Marlboro.
00:19:56.361,00:19:58.447,Do you like the same colors?
00:19:59.865,00:20:01.742,"Yeah, I was curious. How's their taste in women? Is it similar?"
00:20:05.495,00:20:07.664,It seems they all like older women.
00:20:07.789,00:20:09.625,Somebody said you all liked older women.
00:20:17.132,00:20:20.219,is that each of the brothers grew up with an adopted sister.
00:20:20.302,00:20:23.180,"All the girls, now 21 years old."
00:20:26.141,00:20:27.935,"I can't get over it, I'm telling you."
00:20:28.060,00:20:31.688,"An extraordinary string of coincidences, you all have to agree, -right? -It's beautiful."
00:20:31.772,00:20:34.942,"You say you love each other, but you've only known each other for such a short time."
00:20:35.025,00:20:36.902,-Doesn't matter. It was instantaneous. -I've known him my whole life.
00:20:36.985,00:20:38.570,How long did it take for you to have that feeling?
00:20:48.038,00:20:54.378,It was just absolutely astounding because they grew up in what appeared to be pretty different households.
00:21:03.887,00:21:07.057,"a middle-class family, and a more affluent family."
00:21:11.311,00:21:15.023,Bobby's parents... Bobby's father was a medical doctor.
00:21:16.692,00:21:18.610,And his mother was an attorney.
00:21:19.236,00:21:20.946,So they were very well-educated.
00:21:21.029,00:21:26.034,And they were living in one of the most prestigious areas of the country.
00:21:29.037,00:21:31.039,Eddy's father was a teacher.
00:21:31.957,00:21:37.129,"He had a college education, and they lived in what would be considered..."
00:21:38.588,00:21:40.048,A middle-class neighborhood.
00:21:42.884,00:21:47.889,"My family, on paper, were the least educated."
00:21:49.182,00:21:50.976,They were immigrants.
00:21:51.310,00:21:53.395,English was a second language to them.
00:21:54.438,00:21:56.106,They had a little store.
00:21:56.982,00:21:59.609,They were the more blue-collar family.
00:22:01.403,00:22:07.242,"Um, but my father was just this incredibly generous, warm guy."
00:22:08.493,00:22:12.247,"David's father, Richard, was larger than life."
00:22:15.876,00:22:20.964,"If you could imagine this guy, he was a big guy, with a big cigar always hanging out of his mouth."
00:22:23.967,00:22:25.302,We referred to him as bubele.
00:22:28.013,00:22:31.058,"If you know Yiddish, bubele, it's like love."
00:22:31.141,00:22:33.268,It's hugging and it's kissing.
00:22:36.438,00:22:38.065,than any place else.
00:22:38.940,00:22:43.028,Bubele celebrated us like no other person.
00:22:43.653,00:22:45.447,"He said, I have two more sons."
00:22:51.953,00:22:57.667,"When the boys found each other, it just sort of happened then and there."
00:22:58.210,00:23:00.921,"Here's this wonderful story, and that's it."
00:23:01.755,00:23:05.967,"Nobody questioned what was going on, except the parents, of course."
00:23:12.766,00:23:21.399,there was great anger in all of them about the fact that the parents had never been told that there were two other children.
00:23:27.447,00:23:34.204,"We knew nothing about the other two till, uh, the boys met at school."
00:23:34.287,00:23:36.331,That was 20 years later.
00:23:42.379,00:23:45.465,I believe they were six months old when they were separated.
00:23:45.549,00:23:55.016,If you imagine those three little bodies lying together and suddenly the coldness of being alone in the crib.
00:23:57.102,00:23:59.187,It's a terrible deprivation.
00:24:07.279,00:24:09.698,that I would slam my head against the wall.
00:24:10.407,00:24:12.450,I would... I would basically knock myself out.
00:24:12.742,00:24:16.454,My mother said I would bang my head on the inside of the crib.
00:24:19.332,00:24:22.586,And I would hold my breath until I passed out.
00:24:24.337,00:24:26.214,I believe it was absolutely...
00:24:27.132,00:24:28.425,Separation anxiety.
00:24:33.430,00:24:36.641,All of us had been adopted from Louise Wise Services.
00:24:39.019,00:24:49.988,"the New York institution founded back in 1916, overseen by a board of directors drawn from New York City's social, financial, and political elite."
00:24:55.869,00:24:58.705,"for Jewish babies, in particular."
00:24:58.955,00:25:01.374,That was the place to go.
00:25:01.458,00:25:17.724,"What we have felt at Louise Wise Services, where I have been active for a great long time, is that adoptive parents should be told as much about the background of a child as is reasonable."
00:25:18.016,00:25:20.769,"Our parents, they... They wanted answers."
00:25:20.852,00:25:21.853,They were angry.
00:25:21.937,00:25:24.940,"And they arranged a meeting, and they, uh, uh..."
00:25:25.023,00:25:28.193,Six of them went into Louise Wise Agency...
00:25:29.819,00:25:33.406,to try to get some answers in terms of piecing together what happened.
00:25:51.633,00:25:56.638,"And they were asked, Is it true that you separated these boys at birth?"
00:26:03.186,00:26:05.188,"And they said, Yes, we did."
00:26:08.942,00:26:10.193,Why?
00:26:12.362,00:26:14.030,How could you not tell us?
00:26:14.781,00:26:16.074,What did you do?
00:26:17.575,00:26:19.661,"Why, and how could you?"
00:26:23.957,00:26:28.295,was because it was hard to place three children in one home.
00:26:32.048,00:26:35.593,that it was in our best interests that we'd been split up.
00:26:35.677,00:26:44.227,That not every parent would welcome triplets and that triplets would be difficult to place.
00:26:44.936,00:26:46.396,Which...
00:26:47.564,00:26:52.819,"I think, at that moment, my father blew his stack and just said, We would've taken all three."
00:26:53.820,00:26:55.363,There's no question.
00:26:55.447,00:26:56.865,And he was furious.
00:27:08.752,00:27:11.963,And my father realized that he had left his umbrella in there.
00:27:16.468,00:27:19.220,And he went back to get the umbrella.
00:27:23.016,00:27:29.481,And he walked into the room to see them breaking open a bottle of champagne...
00:27:32.692,00:27:36.154,And toasting each other as if they had dodged a bullet.
00:27:39.240,00:27:41.868,They looked like they'd just...
00:27:41.951,00:27:49.292,"Just missed, uh, getting hurt or killed or what have you."
00:27:49.376,00:27:51.127,"It was a, uh..."
00:27:51.795,00:27:54.089,That was memorable.
00:28:08.103,00:28:12.148,"and, initially, they were met with a lot of enthusiasm."
00:28:12.440,00:28:21.324,"And, um, invariably, within a short period of time, were told there's a conflict and they could not take the case."
00:28:21.866,00:28:31.960,"They said, We have a number of associates who are trying to adopt through Louise Wise, and we don't want to ruin their chances."
00:28:33.002,00:28:35.296,So that lawsuit was out.
00:28:45.223,00:28:49.310,"We didn't understand it, and to a degree, we almost didn't care."
00:28:52.856,00:28:54.691,Our heads were in the clouds.
00:28:54.858,00:29:02.157,"We knew our parents were pissed off, but it was almost like, well, that's our parents' thing to do while we were out partying."
00:29:09.164,00:29:10.874,Drugs were different. People were different.
00:29:10.957,00:29:12.834,Sex was different. Music was different.
00:29:14.502,00:29:16.588,We just took advantage of all those things.
00:29:16.671,00:29:18.840,"Sex, drugs, rock and roll."
00:29:23.887,00:29:26.139,"They were running amok in New York, I'll say."
00:29:31.186,00:29:34.522,Limelight. Copacabana. They were hitting them all.
00:29:41.946,00:29:45.742,"All the newspapers were following the boys around, no matter where we went."
00:29:50.622,00:30:17.774,"and my mother throwing the New York Post at me, at the kitchen table, saying, Guys! Guys! You're the guys!"
00:30:17.982,00:30:20.443,Could you please be in my movie? Please be in my movie.
00:30:26.491,00:30:29.744,"We didn't know who she was, and she was... She was Madonna."
00:30:30.703,00:30:33.248,They stood on the side and ogled her.
00:30:33.623,00:30:37.043,"Pretty soon we got an apartment together, the triplets' apartment."
00:30:38.753,00:30:41.172,"The triplets' apartment, hmm!"
00:30:41.256,00:30:46.928,It's like if you had the most bachelor apartment times three.
00:30:47.011,00:30:48.888,The liquor store used to deliver the liquor.
00:30:51.683,00:30:54.936,"At one point, Eddy had appendicitis."
00:30:55.979,00:30:57.522,He had no insurance.
00:30:57.856,00:31:03.570,"And so he checked into the hospital as Bobby and had his appendix taken out, as Bobby."
00:31:03.653,00:31:06.698,"I hope to this day, Bobby's appendix stays pretty healthy."
00:31:10.743,00:31:17.959,"going out together, going on dates together, living together, from the time we met till..."
00:31:18.918,00:31:23.047,"Well, till later, there was nothing, nothing that could keep us apart."
00:31:28.720,00:31:37.395,"Initially, I couldn't really tell them apart, and I would bump into them, and I wasn't quite sure which one I was going out with, so..."
00:31:38.479,00:31:45.904,"Bob has this very raw, natural type of intelligence that I think I was attracted to."
00:31:46.321,00:31:49.908,"I always thought David was, um..."
00:31:50.408,00:31:52.911,"The best, right, of the three of them."
00:31:52.994,00:31:54.579,I've said it before.
00:31:54.662,00:31:56.497,"You know, I got the pick of the litter."
00:31:58.416,00:32:05.298,"Without a doubt, Eddy was the, um, handsomest of all the three triplets, yeah."
00:32:05.715,00:32:10.053,"Of course, I'm partial, but, you know, I adored him."
00:32:12.430,00:32:16.392,"When I met him, he was the last holdout."
00:32:17.393,00:32:19.562,The Casanova of the three.
00:32:22.148,00:32:25.735,"And I said, Oh, boy, this guy's a real bachelor, like, player."
00:32:28.196,00:32:35.203,"But he was so warm in his smile, and he had wonderful, beautiful hands, soft hands."
00:32:35.286,00:32:37.497,"And when I shook his hand, I mean, I just..."
00:32:37.580,00:32:39.540,"You know, I just fell in love with him."
00:32:43.044,00:32:48.549,"I'm from a big, colorful Irish-Catholic family, and he was a Jewish guy."
00:32:48.633,00:32:53.054,"When he came to the house for the first time, he looked at my dad."
00:32:54.973,00:32:58.559,"And he said, I don't know if you know this, Mr. Shanley."
00:32:59.185,00:33:03.022,I've been seeing Brenda every night pretty much since the first day I met her.
00:33:03.106,00:33:07.068,"And I thought, Oh, my God, my dad knows that, you know, we're together every night."
00:33:07.151,00:33:10.738,"And my dad just sort of, you know, looked at me like Okay."
00:33:10.822,00:33:12.031,And that was Eddy.
00:33:12.991,00:33:14.826,-I do. -I do.
00:33:25.628,00:33:26.629,We love you.
00:33:38.850,00:33:48.818,"If there was a scale, Bobby would be reserved, David would be middle, and Eddy was just the lovable, mushy, huggable, funny..."
00:33:48.901,00:33:52.113,"You know, he just exuded warmth and love."
00:33:59.120,00:34:00.163,Hi.
00:34:04.459,00:34:07.253,"Hi. Look at this girl, Daddy. Yes, Daddy."
00:34:07.336,00:34:10.548,Daddy decided to show up and make a special guest appearance.
00:34:29.650,00:34:32.361,being around David and Bobby.
00:34:32.987,00:34:38.951,"Eddy seemed to get the most out of the three of them meeting, for whatever reason."
00:34:45.124,00:34:49.712,to have a beautiful life and everyone to get along.
00:34:50.838,00:34:54.175,And he wanted everyone to be one big family.
00:35:01.974,00:35:05.561,"in terms of, uh, leading the search for our birth mother."
00:35:05.978,00:35:08.272,"He got a fever, and he just wanted to do it."
00:35:09.232,00:35:13.069,And Alan was also rallying 'cause it was just an exciting thing to do.
00:35:15.947,00:35:26.124,"of having triplets born, in New York, on July 12, 1961?"
00:35:26.499,00:35:32.755,We figured out that New York Public Library shared birth records.
00:35:36.300,00:35:39.428,and went page by page by page by page by page.
00:35:39.512,00:35:41.681,"And within a couple of hours, it was, Bingo!"
00:35:42.348,00:35:44.684,"Male, male, male."
00:35:44.767,00:35:46.269,Three in a row.
00:35:46.769,00:35:48.729,"All born July 12, 1961."
00:35:52.900,00:35:54.402,birth mother's last name.
00:35:57.655,00:36:00.741,"The first meeting was a bar on, like, 47th Street."
00:36:02.660,00:36:07.582,It was like her local neighborhood watering hole on the East Side.
00:36:08.207,00:36:09.750,And it was awkward.
00:36:10.126,00:36:12.003,She told the story of what happened.
00:36:12.545,00:36:15.131,"Um, unfortunately, it wasn't a romantic story."
00:36:15.423,00:36:16.924,She was a young girl.
00:36:17.884,00:36:21.762,"Basically, prom night knock-up type thing."
00:36:32.148,00:36:34.901,that she had triplets and had to give them up.
00:36:38.362,00:36:42.116,"You know, to us, at 19, you drink like a fish, you think you're invincible."
00:36:46.037,00:36:49.749,But we found it a little concerning that she was...
00:36:50.791,00:36:53.085,"Pretty much keeping up with us, you know."
00:36:53.336,00:37:00.468,"Um, the apple doesn't fall that far from the tree, and if that's the tree, I was less than thrilled."
00:37:00.885,00:37:03.804,"And, um, we had our parents already."
00:37:04.013,00:37:06.557,So we met her and it was okay.
00:37:09.018,00:37:12.730,But she was not a particularly close part of our lives.
00:37:16.025,00:37:20.446,We were all young and starting our marriages and careers.
00:37:25.368,00:37:27.411,are identical triplets.
00:37:27.495,00:37:29.664,"Now they run a New York restaurant called, what else?"
00:37:29.747,00:37:31.249,You guessed. Triplets.
00:37:42.760,00:37:44.345,They came to see the triplets.
00:37:44.845,00:37:47.014,They wanted to be waited on by one of the triplets.
00:37:47.098,00:37:51.560,"We served vodka, frozen blocks of ice, and we'd get the whole room up and dancing."
00:37:56.148,00:37:58.901,"It was like this big party going, this big bar mitzvah."
00:38:04.573,00:38:09.370,Triplets become wildly successful owning a restaurant in the SoHo district of New York City.
00:38:12.832,00:38:14.834,We did over a million dollars the first year.
00:38:20.464,00:38:24.552,That's when things kinda got funky.
00:38:43.029,00:38:49.327,I started working on a story for The New Yorker magazine about identical twins reared apart.
00:38:51.162,00:38:57.585,I've always thought what would it be like if you turned the corner one day and you saw yourself.
00:39:03.215,00:39:08.429,"In the process of my research, I came across this obscure scientific article."
00:39:16.437,00:39:23.444,It referenced this secret study in which identical siblings had been separated.
00:39:26.155,00:39:29.575,I was shocked and intrigued.
00:39:31.118,00:39:34.121,They were separating identical babies at birth...
00:39:35.539,00:39:39.001,For the purpose of this scientific experiment.
00:39:39.919,00:39:44.173,And these babies had all come from one adoption agency in New York City.
00:39:57.686,00:39:58.562,It's beautiful.
00:40:02.316,00:40:03.567,and a more affluent family.
00:40:05.820,00:40:08.114,as much as is reasonable.
00:40:12.868,00:40:15.287,as if they had dodged a bullet.
00:40:22.128,00:40:25.005,And these babies had all come from Louise Wise Services.
00:40:38.519,00:40:41.772,and he told me all about the experiment.
00:40:43.274,00:40:45.443,"And I said, This is like Nazi shit."
00:40:54.160,00:40:57.746,"It was kind of like reality hitting, like, a tidal wave."
00:41:00.249,00:41:03.127,We were a science experiment.
00:41:03.836,00:41:08.591,These people split us up and studied us like lab rats.
00:41:11.302,00:41:16.348,"We didn't recognize this stuff until it was put in our face, until it was in newsprint."
00:41:20.394,00:41:23.439,But there were clues in the past.
00:41:26.108,00:41:33.032,"I remember from a very young age, people would come to the house..."
00:41:35.868,00:41:38.204,Usually a young man and a young woman.
00:41:45.044,00:41:47.129,And they had me taking tests.
00:41:47.546,00:41:51.425,"They did IQ tests, personality inventory tests."
00:41:51.509,00:41:54.136,They did eye-hand coordination tests.
00:41:54.512,00:41:56.680,I do remember people coming to the house...
00:41:57.806,00:41:59.350,Having tests done.
00:42:00.142,00:42:01.936,Square pegs and round holes.
00:42:03.020,00:42:05.523,Rorschach inkblot tests.
00:42:07.441,00:42:10.069,What does this mean to you? That kind of stuff.
00:42:16.033,00:42:25.459,"he remembers people watching him and taking notes, and they would ask him questions, and he would get frustrated with the questions."
00:42:26.710,00:42:29.880,And he remembers they were videotaping him.
00:42:30.506,00:42:32.758,I remember the filming more than anything else.
00:42:36.303,00:42:42.643,I remember having Super 8 mm films taken of me when I was on a swing set or on the slide.
00:42:43.269,00:42:45.896,"Every single time they came, they filmed."
00:42:48.065,00:42:50.109,Riding my bike. Throwing a ball.
00:42:50.192,00:42:56.699,"And they wanted to see how many times I could, you know, go on my pogo stick, roller-skating, throwing a Frisbee, shooting a bow and arrow."
00:42:56.865,00:42:59.159,"You know, they had my attention. I was performing."
00:43:00.953,00:43:04.123,The stuff they did would be more complex as I got older.
00:43:07.585,00:43:13.007,I didn't really understand why they needed to come so often and why were they asking me all these questions.
00:43:13.465,00:43:19.722,"Somewhere around age nine or ten, I started becoming less comfortable with it, and it was kinda like, Mom, do I still have to do this?"
00:43:21.348,00:43:22.850,Do I still have to do this?
00:43:27.813,00:43:34.903,they were each told that we were being followed as part of a normal study of the development of adopted children.
00:43:36.113,00:43:39.325,They had no idea that we had been separated.
00:43:46.749,00:43:50.294,were all going to be in a normal study of adopted children.
00:43:51.045,00:43:52.504,"And, uh..."
00:43:53.339,00:43:56.967,"As far as we knew, that was it."
00:43:58.802,00:44:02.848,"This was a new thing, they were going to follow up with all the children."
00:44:03.724,00:44:06.393,"And at the time, we accepted it."
00:44:10.272,00:44:13.067,that went and held a baby...
00:44:14.652,00:44:17.780,And did psychological testing on a six-month-old baby.
00:44:19.281,00:44:36.131,"And then went to another house to see his brother, and then went to another house to see his brother, and did this over years and years and years and years with full knowledge that we were within a hundred-mile radius..."
00:44:37.424,00:44:39.051,And not knowing each other.
00:44:40.886,00:44:43.681,It's just... It's unconscionable.
00:44:44.598,00:44:51.605,Who would think that anybody would be evil enough to come up with something like this?
00:45:02.616,00:45:09.623,I learned that the person really in charge of the study was Dr. Peter Neubauer.
00:45:12.209,00:45:17.172,"Very distinguished psychiatrist in New York, director of the Freud archives."
00:45:17.714,00:45:28.016,"He was an Austrian refugee from the Holocaust, and he set up shop in New York and became, you know, one of the great men of psychiatry in America."
00:45:30.144,00:45:40.696,"What I learned is that the people at the Louise Wise Agency were separating identical siblings, and then a team of scientists, led by Neubauer, would follow them."
00:45:42.406,00:45:44.241,But it wasn't just the triplets.
00:45:47.035,00:45:48.579,There were others.
00:45:50.581,00:45:55.627,"After my article came out, another twin set discovered themselves."
00:45:56.128,00:45:57.546,And here they are now.
00:45:57.629,00:45:59.756,-I appreciate you coming on today. -Our pleasure.
00:46:02.259,00:46:04.761,Paula Bernstein and Elyse Schein are on the show.
00:46:05.512,00:46:09.057,The story is incredible. Is that the way to tell it?
00:46:09.141,00:46:12.561,"It's funny. I mean, we say if it hadn't happened to us, we wouldn't believe it."
00:46:14.980,00:46:16.732,It's a little darker than a Disney movie.
00:46:16.899,00:46:25.157,"I was at home in my apartment in Brooklyn with my two-year-old daughter, and the phone rings, and I'm just, La-da-da, and I answer the phone, and it was the adoption agency."
00:46:25.240,00:46:26.366,We've got some news for you.
00:46:26.450,00:46:28.827,"You've got a twin sister, and she's looking for you."
00:46:28.911,00:46:31.246,You were both editors of your high school paper.
00:46:31.330,00:46:32.664,You both went to film school.
00:46:32.831,00:46:39.796,"Well, it's funny, because I don't know if you noticed, but-- I contacted the adoption agency."
00:46:39.880,00:46:42.090,"I asked them, Well, why we were separated?"
00:46:42.174,00:46:43.842,That's the million-dollar question in this story.
00:46:43.926,00:46:45.010,And they said for a twin study.
00:46:45.093,00:46:59.983,"We felt that our lives had been orchestrated by these, um, scientific researchers who put their scientific needs, research needs or desires, their career interests before the needs of us and the interests of us and the other twins and triplets who were separated."
00:47:04.238,00:47:06.657,identical twins were involved in this study.
00:47:06.740,00:47:10.911,"I was told six to eight, but we don't really know."
00:47:15.582,00:47:23.382,"When you have a study like this, normally you produce the results and you show how large the sample is and all this sort of thing."
00:47:24.091,00:47:30.764,"But this study was never published, which makes it all the more intriguing."
00:47:34.726,00:47:37.312,try to get us some of the study records.
00:47:38.063,00:47:41.149,We received a small amount of information.
00:47:41.733,00:47:47.656,"It was very dry, technical data that didn't really shed any light on the reasons for the study."
00:47:47.906,00:47:49.032,It was garbage.
00:47:50.617,00:47:55.247,I don't know what the results were or if there ever were results 'cause I never saw them.
00:47:59.626,00:48:01.461,from the people they did it to.
00:48:02.129,00:48:03.130,Why?
00:48:06.842,00:48:09.469,The study was never published. Why?
00:48:31.908,00:48:38.415,"My name is Natasha Josefowitz, and I was Peter Neubauer's research assistant."
00:48:46.340,00:48:49.468,"So, come on in. Would you like a cup of coffee?"
00:48:52.429,00:48:54.890,Here are some of my buddies.
00:48:55.390,00:48:57.017,Michelle Obama and I.
00:48:57.100,00:48:58.810,She is very tall.
00:48:58.935,00:49:02.314,I'm like a little shrimp next to her. I come up to her right here.
00:49:02.939,00:49:06.610,"This is Obama three years ago, and here he is holding my latest book."
00:49:06.818,00:49:09.571,"I have to tell you, I said, Barack, I love you."
00:49:09.655,00:49:11.907,"He said, I love you too, and he gave me a kiss on this cheek."
00:49:13.659,00:49:16.578,This is Robert Redford and Al Gore.
00:49:17.162,00:49:20.749,And this is Errol Flynn and me when I was 18.
00:49:20.832,00:49:22.209,I thought he was a hoot.
00:49:23.168,00:49:24.753,Picassos.
00:49:27.255,00:49:29.049,When are we gonna talk about the twin study?
00:49:34.304,00:49:37.432,"You know, you need to know I am not part of the team."
00:49:38.100,00:49:41.520,I am a peripheral person. I just do the hearsay.
00:49:44.981,00:49:51.029,"The first time I heard about the twin study, it was still just a dream in Peter's head."
00:49:55.158,00:49:59.746,"Hmm. Sexy, nice-looking, interesting."
00:50:02.082,00:50:04.042,His background was very Freudian.
00:50:04.418,00:50:08.338,"Anna Freud, Freud's daughter, would often come and visit with him."
00:50:10.674,00:50:16.012,He was very focused on wanting to make a difference in children's lives.
00:50:19.015,00:50:27.774,"Peter started thinking, Wouldn't it be interesting to have a study of mothers who wanted to give up their children, who happen to be identical twins..."
00:50:29.693,00:50:32.487,And then could be separated at birth?
00:50:33.572,00:50:42.748,"If we could put them in two totally different environments, we would put to rest the dilemma, nature or nurture, forever."
00:50:45.667,00:50:47.586,"Now, you may think, Oh, this is terrible."
00:50:47.669,00:50:49.379,"You know, how could you do this?"
00:50:49.796,00:50:53.884,You have to put yourself back in the late '50s and '60s.
00:50:55.844,00:50:59.347,This was not something that seemed to be bad.
00:51:04.352,00:51:07.481,That was not at all in anyone's thoughts.
00:51:08.190,00:51:10.275,This was a very exciting time.
00:51:12.736,00:51:16.698,Psychology was just beginning to be the big deal that everybody's talking about.
00:51:17.324,00:51:19.242,This was all in terms of research.
00:51:19.326,00:51:20.535,An opportunity.
00:51:27.667,00:51:29.961,How do we become the people we are?
00:51:30.045,00:51:35.509,How much of nature versus how much of nurture shapes us into the people that we become?
00:51:41.473,00:51:43.892,But I would hear about it because I was in the office.
00:51:46.102,00:51:48.522,What they found out was incredible.
00:51:51.608,00:51:54.027,Our lives are parallel to a phenomenal degree.
00:51:54.110,00:51:56.530,It's... It's ridiculous.
00:51:56.613,00:51:57.572,We're all the same.
00:51:57.656,00:52:00.492,As soon as we started discussing our personalities-- Personalities are the same.
00:52:00.575,00:52:02.494,-Our gestures are the same. -We always talk at the same time.
00:52:02.577,00:52:04.412,You were raised in different homes.
00:52:06.289,00:52:11.211,I did not believe that it'd be as much hereditary as it was.
00:52:11.294,00:52:13.296,That was more than any of us thought.
00:52:13.380,00:52:16.299,"-I'll start a sentence, he'll finish it. -We all like Chinese food."
00:52:25.600,00:52:27.394,How's their taste in women? Is it similar?
00:52:30.647,00:52:34.985,We are moved to behaviors that we are totally unconscious about.
00:52:39.948,00:52:42.367,You were both editors of your high school paper.
00:52:42.450,00:52:43.869,You both went to film school.
00:52:43.952,00:52:52.377,"I don't know if you noticed, but-- It's disturbing. We don't like that."
00:52:52.460,00:52:54.504,"People don't like to hear it. They say, I have free will."
00:52:57.716,00:53:02.220,We would prefer that we have some influence over our lives.
00:53:02.470,00:53:04.180,Wouldn't you rather know that?
00:53:04.472,00:53:07.475,That you have some control over this? And so finding out...
00:53:07.559,00:53:09.477,Never mind. Doesn't matter what you do.
00:53:13.857,00:53:19.571,"So, I think it's upsetting to people to see how little influence they have, how little control they have."
00:53:19.654,00:53:21.823,We don't like that. We fight that.
00:53:35.045,00:53:39.799,"And so earthshaking, why haven't you published your study?"
00:53:43.178,00:53:45.472,There's a lot that we don't know.
00:53:46.932,00:53:49.768,We have anecdotes that are very provocative.
00:53:50.685,00:53:52.938,But we don't know. We don't have the data.
00:53:59.319,00:54:06.743,I moved to Switzerland in 1965 and lost touch with what was going on.
00:54:08.787,00:54:11.039,All that research should be seen.
00:54:11.998,00:54:15.043,"This study was the first, and it's also the last."
00:54:15.126,00:54:17.712,It will never be done again. It will never be replicated.
00:54:18.296,00:54:20.465,It's monumental. It's a monumental study.
00:54:24.260,00:54:30.558,"In terms of their motivation that they used to justify what they did, I don't even care, because I... I... I..."
00:54:30.642,00:54:32.185,It's not justifiable what they did.
00:54:39.109,00:54:43.238,"Coming from the Holocaust, our family..."
00:54:45.907,00:54:50.161,Has a knowledge of that when you play with humans...
00:54:54.416,00:54:56.334,You do something very wrong.
00:54:59.629,00:55:09.597,"And I really believe that because of this research, these three boys did not have happy endings."
00:55:17.188,00:55:22.694,What were some of the similarities you found that you had as you were all growing up in your own respective households?
00:55:24.612,00:55:26.489,We all smoked the same cigarettes when we met.
00:55:26.573,00:55:28.700,"We all wrestled in high school, in junior high."
00:55:28.783,00:55:30.118,We all loved the same food.
00:55:30.201,00:55:32.412,"Uh, our taste in women was similar."
00:55:32.495,00:55:35.457,What are some of the stranger things you found out you had in common?
00:55:37.917,00:55:40.545,Any other more surprising discoveries?
00:55:40.628,00:55:46.926,"Well, sometimes when you think you're having a unique thought or idea, and you go to share it with someone, and they say, Your brother just told me."
00:55:48.386,00:55:49.721,It's a little annoying. It's unnerving.
00:55:53.349,00:55:55.727,damaged our relationship.
00:55:55.977,00:55:58.897,There were conflicting work ethics.
00:56:00.774,00:56:03.610,And my father had passed away.
00:56:07.030,00:56:14.162,"He really anchored us together as a group and kept the peace, so to speak."
00:56:16.498,00:56:23.463,"You know? And they didn't have that opportunity, that gift of being able to be brothers for 18 years."
00:56:23.630,00:56:31.346,"When you are living in a family of children, you learn how to adjust to each other."
00:56:32.305,00:56:39.437,"If I don't like the way you do this, I can get angry or I can learn to compromise."
00:56:39.979,00:56:43.108,But they met as adults.
00:56:45.193,00:56:48.488,And had never learned how to live with each other.
00:56:48.905,00:56:51.574,"As things went on, things got more complicated."
00:56:52.033,00:56:57.372,"And as things got more complicated, what ended up happening was I left."
00:57:03.753,00:57:06.131,Eddy and I felt that we were being betrayed.
00:57:07.841,00:57:10.093,Bobby felt that he was being pushed out.
00:57:11.761,00:57:18.309,"Either way, it did major, major damage to the relationship."
00:57:24.732,00:57:27.444,"more so than, I think, David and Bobby."
00:57:28.278,00:57:35.869,"Eddy was always the one who just wanted to have everybody be at peace together, and Eddy was very upset about it."
00:57:35.952,00:57:38.037,He was kind of crushed about it. It was eating at him.
00:57:44.252,00:57:48.298,He was just not really sure how to deal with it all.
00:57:48.423,00:57:56.264,"And you're just seeing a lot more, uh, kind of up-and-down behaviors, erratic behaviors."
00:58:05.523,00:58:09.486,You're just seeing a lot more unnatural highs and lows.
00:58:09.569,00:58:12.614,He would call people and...
00:58:13.114,00:58:24.250,"At bizarre hours of the evening, and then they would say, I haven't seen or heard from Eddy in ten years."
00:58:24.334,00:58:28.379,Why is he picking up the telephone and calling me at two o'clock in the morning?
00:58:28.463,00:58:31.424,"You know, those are... Those are signs."
00:58:31.508,00:58:32.926,This was just...
00:58:33.009,00:58:36.387,This was more than just somebody who needed counseling.
00:58:36.471,00:58:39.432,"This was, like, really something very, very serious."
00:58:45.271,00:58:46.606,Hello!
00:58:47.440,00:58:50.068,But the downswing was a lot of anger.
00:58:50.151,00:58:53.404,"Uh, there was just deep, deep darkness."
00:59:00.161,00:59:02.580,It made sense in hindsight.
00:59:11.089,00:59:17.428,"I didn't walk down the aisle thinking, you know, I have a man who is suffering from manic depression."
00:59:22.308,00:59:23.726,"People will say, How could you not know?"
00:59:26.604,00:59:31.359,"He was so unique and so wonderful and special, you just... Oh, that was Eddy, you know."
00:59:37.949,00:59:42.412,I was advised that he needed to be in a facility.
00:59:48.376,00:59:55.758,"I mean, I felt bad that I put him through this trauma of going into a psych ward because I had been in a psych ward and I know how hard it is."
00:59:55.842,00:59:59.804,"When I was a kid, I spent my 16th birthday in a psych ward."
01:00:01.389,01:00:04.183,We all were really disturbed kids.
01:00:04.267,01:00:07.270,We were all under psychiatric care when we were teenagers.
01:00:16.446,01:00:18.531,And dysfunctional teenage years.
01:00:27.290,01:00:29.500,"One of you were involved in a murder, is that right?"
01:00:31.502,01:00:33.254,Uh... It's up to you guys.
01:00:35.632,01:00:39.052,One was accused of being involved in a murder.
01:00:39.927,01:00:44.849,"And it was me, who never met this person who was killed."
01:00:44.932,01:00:47.101,"Never was present, or anything like that."
01:00:47.852,01:00:49.312,It was peer pressure.
01:00:49.687,01:00:54.108,"Friends pressuring me into covering for them, telling a story for them to the police."
01:00:54.192,01:00:55.735,And that pulled me right into it.
01:00:55.818,01:00:57.320,I've never hurt anyone in my life.
01:00:57.403,01:01:00.073,-And that... -We know it. We can feel it.
01:01:00.156,01:01:01.199,We can feel it.
01:01:09.666,01:01:12.335,had dysfunctional childhoods.
01:01:12.794,01:01:15.129,And some mental problems.
01:01:15.213,01:01:18.383,"And it raises questions, you know."
01:01:18.466,01:01:28.976,"If you are a person who has devoted your life, like Dr. Neubauer has, to the study of mental illness, then, um, is that a factor that you're researching?"
01:01:32.021,01:01:33.606,The story is incredible.
01:01:36.150,01:01:37.652,It's a little darker than a Disney movie.
01:01:40.780,01:01:45.118,"When we first met, we realized we had all these similarities."
01:01:45.201,01:01:47.036,We had similar mannerisms.
01:01:47.495,01:01:49.497,"Um, we both had studied film."
01:01:51.332,01:01:55.586,And then we also found out we both had suffered from depression.
01:01:59.215,01:02:03.678,"So, this is the letter that I received from Louise Wise Services."
01:02:03.886,01:02:06.305,You were born at 12:51 p.m.
01:02:06.389,01:02:11.519,"on October 9, 1968 to a 29-year-old Jewish single woman."
01:02:11.602,01:02:14.021,She was very intelligent with a high IQ.
01:02:14.272,01:02:20.194,"She entered college on a merit scholarship, but emotional problems interrupted her attendance."
01:02:20.737,01:02:25.158,She had a history of voluntary hospitalizations for emotional problems.
01:02:25.742,01:02:33.916,"Although I have not been able to locate the original medical reports, secondary sources noted that your mother's diagnosis was schizophrenia."
01:02:35.585,01:02:40.923,It was really disturbing to read that my birth mother had been in and out of institutions.
01:02:43.176,01:02:47.638,I started finding out more about the other twins and triplets in the study.
01:02:48.848,01:02:58.357,"And it turns out that not only had many of them struggled with mental health problems, but that their birth parents had mental health issues."
01:02:58.441,01:03:01.027,And their adoptive families had never been told.
01:03:04.363,01:03:06.866,"you know, your mother had mental health issues?"
01:03:09.035,01:03:10.495,Um...
01:03:14.040,01:03:15.583,I don't think they were severe.
01:03:16.000,01:03:19.003,"I... I think that she was, uh..."
01:03:19.670,01:03:21.547,She may have had some minor...
01:03:22.256,01:03:25.176,"Minor issues, um..."
01:03:29.847,01:03:32.850,She may have had some... A little bit more than minor issues.
01:03:40.900,01:03:44.237,whose biological parents had mental illness?
01:03:46.697,01:03:53.704,And placing them into different homes to see is mental illness heritable?
01:04:04.674,01:04:07.426,And then he came back to work at the restaurant.
01:04:11.514,01:04:12.974,I wasn't there.
01:04:13.182,01:04:15.184,David was with him all the time.
01:04:17.895,01:04:20.356,I think maybe he can give you better detail about it.
01:04:24.735,01:04:26.404,I was running the kitchen.
01:04:26.487,01:04:28.072,Eddy wasn't in.
01:04:28.155,01:04:30.366,"I was running the kitchen, he was running the front of the house."
01:04:30.449,01:04:31.742,That's the way it worked.
01:04:32.201,01:04:34.161,And I didn't know where he was.
01:04:34.370,01:04:35.913,And he lived across the street.
01:04:40.960,01:04:52.054,"and he asked me to look out the window to see if Eddy's car was in the driveway, because if it were in the driveway, we knew that he was home."
01:04:52.847,01:04:56.058,"So, the car was in the driveway."
01:04:56.142,01:04:59.520,"And I said to David, um..."
01:05:01.230,01:05:03.900,Do you want me to go over there?
01:05:04.650,01:05:08.321,"And David said, Yes."
01:05:11.908,01:05:15.953,And she called me back a few minutes later and her voice was trembling and shaking.
01:05:16.037,01:05:17.705,"She said, You've gotta come home."
01:05:18.497,01:05:20.458,"And I said, Why?"
01:05:20.666,01:05:23.169,"And she said, Please, you've just got to come home."
01:05:23.794,01:05:25.296,Um...
01:05:28.966,01:05:30.384,"And I, uh..."
01:05:30.843,01:05:32.053,I pulled up.
01:05:32.136,01:05:35.181,"We lived across the street, and I pulled up, kind of, just..."
01:05:35.264,01:05:37.934,"Cop cars were all there, and I, just kind of pulled up on..."
01:05:38.017,01:05:46.275,"And, you know, blocking half the street, left the door open and started running into the house, and the cops grabbed me and they wouldn't let me come in."
01:05:47.652,01:05:49.195,"They said, You don't... You don't wanna see this."
01:05:49.654,01:05:51.530,You can't see this. You don't wanna see this.
01:05:52.406,01:05:54.116,You... You don't wanna see this.
01:05:54.784,01:05:56.327,And that's when I knew he was gone.
01:06:01.290,01:06:04.502,"I told Bobby, I need to talk to you."
01:06:07.421,01:06:09.465,And it's as if he... He kind of knew.
01:06:10.967,01:06:15.012,"He kind of knew, before the words came out of my mouth."
01:06:19.392,01:06:21.018,Eddy committed suicide.
01:06:23.354,01:06:25.272,Eddy shot himself.
01:06:27.358,01:06:28.859,He took his own life.
01:06:41.080,01:06:43.958,I don't remember who told us.
01:06:44.041,01:06:46.043,I just remember darkness.
01:06:58.556,01:07:01.058,And I don't remember everything I said.
01:07:02.560,01:07:08.607,"But I do remember saying that my brother, Eddy, could light up a room with his smile."
01:07:22.830,01:07:26.375,Why Eddy? Why Eddy? Why not me?
01:07:26.459,01:07:28.586,I've asked myself that a hundred times.
01:07:28.669,01:07:30.671,I'd rather it was me than Eddy.
01:07:32.339,01:07:34.925,"I... I don't know why Eddy, and why not me."
01:07:36.093,01:07:38.429,Maybe just because...
01:07:41.098,01:07:43.434,I don't know. I just don't know.
01:07:44.101,01:07:46.395,I... I... I can't answer this.
01:07:56.280,01:07:57.782,"Oh, you're welcome."
01:08:49.792,01:08:57.758,"My understanding, within this small group of twins that were separated and studied..."
01:08:59.510,01:09:02.638,There was more than one suicide.
01:09:04.098,01:09:06.559,It's almost impossible just to be a coincidence.
01:09:16.735,01:09:18.571,Who knows what's in their DNA?
01:09:26.245,01:09:29.707,"anything in the future that I need to know about, I want to know about it."
01:09:39.049,01:09:41.552,I have more questions than I have answers.
01:09:55.149,01:09:56.901,is you don't know what you're going to find out.
01:09:57.526,01:10:03.240,"Sometimes you know what you didn't find out, which is frustrating, like with this story."
01:10:05.451,01:10:10.414,"Well, I didn't get to the bottom of it because I never got to see the study."
01:10:10.664,01:10:13.667,"As no one has, you know. That would be the bottom of it."
01:10:14.376,01:10:16.503,But that's why this is so tantalizing.
01:10:28.724,01:10:32.561,Here's the research that I kept from when I was writing about twins.
01:10:36.857,01:10:40.194,It's been a while since I've had a look in this box.
01:10:40.486,01:10:42.112,This is interesting.
01:10:43.197,01:10:44.782,Mini cassettes.
01:10:47.076,01:10:51.747,"Before he passed away, I managed to talk to Dr. Neubauer."
01:10:52.915,01:10:54.541,He was reluctant.
01:10:54.625,01:10:57.461,"He had not ever spoken about it, to my knowledge."
01:10:58.295,01:11:00.297,All right. Let's see what he has to say.
01:11:06.387,01:11:08.389,How did this study come about?
01:11:23.487,01:11:27.199,"We would publish in about a year, a year and a half from now."
01:11:27.950,01:11:31.078,He was certainly elusive. He was protecting something.
01:11:34.832,01:11:38.127,the scope of the study and how many people were involved in it?
01:11:41.130,01:11:46.593,"a small number of identical twins, separated at birth."
01:11:47.052,01:11:50.723,"For many, many reasons, I don't want to talk about that now."
01:11:51.682,01:11:54.768,We had to stop it because it became too expensive.
01:12:00.482,01:12:03.527,"Uh, once in a while we got some money from Washington."
01:12:08.949,01:12:12.328,Private charities and Washington. What does that mean?
01:12:12.411,01:12:15.247,"And I don't know, you know, where their funding came from."
01:12:21.628,01:12:25.174,I think that there's a great deal of sensitivity about this story.
01:12:26.633,01:12:30.721,There's a lot of powerful people who would like to have this story silenced.
01:12:41.190,01:12:45.819,he left all the research materials in an archive at Yale University.
01:12:47.738,01:12:52.159,Neubauer placed it under seal for decades and decades.
01:12:53.660,01:12:57.039,"So far as I know, nobody's been able to access it."
01:13:08.467,01:13:09.635,Wow.
01:13:12.971,01:13:19.937,"This is the Yale University website, and this appears to be the Guide to Adoption Study Records of the Child Development Center."
01:13:21.313,01:13:25.359,Sixty-six boxes filled with information.
01:13:26.068,01:13:30.072,"Charts, films and tapes, and research findings."
01:13:30.531,01:13:32.741,Home visits. That's a big one.
01:13:33.325,01:13:37.663,It says that the dates of the study were from 1960 to 1980.
01:13:37.746,01:13:42.042,I guess our reunion kind of closed the study.
01:13:42.126,01:13:44.545,Information about Access.
01:13:45.212,01:13:49.466,The records are restricted until 2066.
01:13:51.844,01:13:53.095,It's sealed.
01:13:56.890,01:14:07.109,"So, they did all that they did to have this whole list tucked away in a dusty library somewhere, where nobody can touch it."
01:14:10.529,01:14:18.579,Researchers wishing to use these records before this date must secure written authorization from the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services.
01:14:24.793,01:14:31.508,The Jewish Board was a parent organization of the Child Development Center run by Peter Neubauer.
01:14:33.594,01:14:41.018,"My understanding is that they're a very, very powerful organization with very deep political connections."
01:14:47.566,01:14:50.068,the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services.
01:14:52.446,01:15:03.790,"Yes, hi. My name is David Kellman, um, and apparently, I was, uh, one of the subjects of a study run by the Child Development Center many years ago."
01:15:03.874,01:15:06.919,And it's being kept at Yale University.
01:15:07.002,01:15:15.177,"-Mmm-hmm. -And, um, on their website it says that I would need permission from the board in order to gain access to those records."
01:15:15.260,01:15:17.596,And somehow the receptionist got me to you.
01:15:20.224,01:15:24.645,"Um, I'm... I'm not aware of any of that stuff or when the study was, but I can forward..."
01:15:24.728,01:15:32.861,"There have been a number of journalists, and as far as I know, some of the twins that were involved in this study have tried to gain access to this material."
01:15:43.455,01:15:47.292,"So far as I know, they haven't been able to see the results of this study."
01:15:48.460,01:15:55.676,"Is there a way that I can go directly to someone that would be able to provide access to me, as I was one of the subjects within the study?"
01:15:59.680,01:16:02.266,it's the people that were actually the subject of the study.
01:16:02.349,01:16:04.017,They should know what was learned.
01:16:07.396,01:16:11.191,who would even be the one to ask right now.
01:16:11.483,01:16:12.985,I would need to look into that.
01:16:13.068,01:16:15.571,"Okay, so you're the first line of defense, so to speak."
01:16:18.156,01:16:20.284,Okay. I will send an e-mail to you.
01:16:20.367,01:16:24.746,"I'll put... The subject line is going to be, uh, Twin Studies."
01:16:25.664,01:16:26.957,Gotcha.
01:16:34.548,01:16:36.466,Peter Neubauer passed away.
01:16:39.970,01:16:47.102,And yet we still don't know exactly what they were looking for or what they found out.
01:17:10.375,01:17:15.714,and I was a research assistant on Peter Neubauer's study.
01:17:16.632,01:17:27.351,I believe I am the only person who worked on this study who is willing to go on record about what was done.
01:17:29.853,01:17:31.521,I was 24.
01:17:31.605,01:17:34.316,This was essentially my first job.
01:17:39.821,01:17:47.913,"You had to be careful to not let on that, uh, Gee, you look just like your twin brother."
01:17:49.456,01:17:51.166,"Then I would've been fired on the spot, right?"
01:17:54.753,01:17:55.754,It was a little tempting.
01:17:55.837,01:17:57.464,"Yeah, there was a little bit of temptation."
01:17:57.547,01:18:00.092,"It's like, Hey, I know your twin."
01:18:01.218,01:18:06.264,I saw somebody a week ago who was exactly like you.
01:18:11.353,01:18:18.068,The question of whether I feel guilty is interesting because I never felt a responsibility.
01:18:19.820,01:18:22.489,I came on after this was designed.
01:18:23.365,01:18:29.955,"However, I was a participant, so you could say, you know, I was ethically compromised by that."
01:18:30.038,01:18:36.586,"In retrospect, uh, I think it was undoubtedly ethically wrong."
01:18:40.424,01:18:41.800,I got some notes here.
01:18:42.300,01:18:43.385,Okay.
01:18:44.428,01:18:45.595,Okay.
01:18:54.771,01:19:00.736,"These are my actual original notes, copies of psychologicals that I did."
01:19:03.989,01:19:05.532,"Well, I have the triplets."
01:19:09.286,01:19:10.996,"Hmm. Oh, here we go."
01:19:11.663,01:19:14.082,"So, I'm not gonna mention the name, but, uh..."
01:19:17.461,01:19:25.969,"His need to establish his autonomy takes the form of showing off both his intelligence and his strength and putting down others, including his parents."
01:19:29.973,01:19:37.439,"Yeah, this one's eager to show off his new bicycle and all of his sports equipment while I filmed him."
01:19:38.732,01:19:42.778,He was very intense in his play and got quite...
01:19:45.238,01:19:46.281,Rough.
01:19:46.490,01:19:48.116,"Yeah, this kid had some problems."
01:19:50.827,01:19:53.038,Hyperaggressiveness.
01:19:55.290,01:20:05.425,"Okay, so apparently, These parents are not cognizant of his problems, nor are they able to help him understand his weaknesses and establish more appropriate control over his actions."
01:20:05.675,01:20:12.516,"So, I didn't think the parents were very tuned in to the struggles this youngster was having."
01:20:18.605,01:20:26.279,I have no idea because I left the study after ten months and the results were never published.
01:20:28.782,01:20:31.368,"All I have is my little, tiny piece."
01:20:31.451,01:20:35.080,It's a mystery. It's a huge loss.
01:20:35.163,01:20:40.627,All this important scientific data is just buried in these archives.
01:20:45.966,01:20:50.178,"that the purpose of the study, ultimate purpose, was looking at mental health."
01:20:52.264,01:20:58.937,There was never a mention of mental health of the biological parents...
01:21:01.231,01:21:02.732,When I was in the study.
01:21:04.484,01:21:07.612,We were not interested in mental health.
01:21:07.696,01:21:09.239,That's not what we were interested in.
01:21:10.824,01:21:12.909,We were looking for differences in parenting.
01:21:17.706,01:21:23.753,We wanted to understand parenting practices and how it would affect development.
01:21:27.799,01:21:29.342,in the family dynamics?
01:21:29.718,01:21:31.052,But they couldn't have known that.
01:21:31.136,01:21:36.558,They didn't know how the families were going to interact with this newly-adopted child.
01:21:37.392,01:21:45.984,The only way they could possibly know about the family dynamics was if they already had a child placed in that family.
01:21:48.194,01:21:52.741,is that each of the brothers grew up in their families with an adopted sister.
01:21:52.824,01:21:55.619,"All the girls, now 21 years old."
01:22:02.500,01:22:09.090,They were placed in families where there was an older adopted child that had been placed by Louise Wise.
01:22:11.134,01:22:12.636,That was part of the design.
01:22:33.657,01:22:34.991,Good to see you.
01:22:39.704,01:22:42.248,"It's Lawrence Perlman, who was a researcher on the study."
01:22:51.633,01:22:55.136,I have no idea because they were never published.
01:22:56.471,01:22:58.264,We were looking for differences in parenting.
01:22:59.975,01:23:05.730,We wanted to understand parenting practices and how it would affect development.
01:23:06.231,01:23:14.072,The triplets were placed in families where there was an older adopted child that had been placed by Louise Wise.
01:23:15.031,01:23:16.533,That was part of the design.
01:23:24.082,01:23:25.542,Like a lab rat.
01:23:28.628,01:23:32.048,It only just makes it that much...
01:23:32.132,01:23:35.385,-It just makes it much more duplicitous. -That much worse.
01:23:38.304,01:23:41.266,"They're not just studying the kids, but they're studying the parents."
01:23:43.101,01:23:47.814,"So, they did, in fact, know the parenting style of each parent."
01:23:48.189,01:23:52.318,"So, this was not, you know, obviously it was far from a random selection."
01:23:52.527,01:24:05.457,They knew exactly who they had chosen to place each one of us with when they called the Gallands and the Kellmans and the Shafrans.
01:24:19.095,01:24:22.640,"the three families were quite, quite different."
01:24:23.308,01:24:26.352,"Uh, David's father stood out."
01:24:27.937,01:24:30.565,There was nobody in the world like his son.
01:24:30.648,01:24:32.609,He was so proud of him.
01:24:32.817,01:24:35.320,Whatever he did was wonderful.
01:24:36.613,01:24:41.493,"Bobby's father was very busy, as a doctor."
01:24:42.911,01:24:53.338,"And didn't have the time to be with Bobby that David's father had, but was as devoted to him as possible."
01:24:55.340,01:24:58.134,The most traditional was Eddy's father...
01:25:00.303,01:25:02.514,Who was rather strict.
01:25:03.723,01:25:05.016,He was the boss.
01:25:05.100,01:25:07.685,"He made the rules, and Eddy was supposed to follow."
01:25:16.528,01:25:18.404,It couldn't have been good.
01:25:23.118,01:25:24.661,And that matters.
01:25:29.749,01:25:34.295,"Because otherwise, I would have known him."
01:25:34.629,01:25:37.632,We would have seen him. Eddy would have talked about him.
01:25:52.313,01:25:55.692,This was the last picture we ever had of Edward.
01:25:56.234,01:25:57.986,He was very gregarious.
01:25:58.778,01:26:01.573,He got into all the things young boys do.
01:26:01.948,01:26:05.743,He wrecked a car and a few things like that.
01:26:05.827,01:26:10.540,"But, uh, I mean, occasionally I disciplined him."
01:26:17.172,01:26:19.883,Eddy was a more artsy kind of kid.
01:26:19.966,01:26:22.385,"You know, he wasn't into sports."
01:26:22.969,01:26:27.599,Elliott had a very strong militaristic kind of approach to life.
01:26:27.682,01:26:29.100,Very traditional.
01:26:29.184,01:26:31.644,He was a teacher. He was all about punctuality.
01:26:32.896,01:26:44.991,"I was a strict disciplinarian, and my children, unfortunately, had me as a strict disciplinarian too."
01:26:50.872,01:26:53.416,he fit in with his family.
01:26:57.086,01:26:58.588,He always felt like...
01:26:59.339,01:27:01.466,Like he wasn't in the right place.
01:27:08.806,01:27:10.350,that Edward was unhappy?
01:27:12.560,01:27:15.313,He didn't discuss his problems with me.
01:27:21.653,01:27:24.030,We were a rather quiet family.
01:27:24.364,01:27:28.576,We didn't tell our problems to one another.
01:27:31.204,01:27:33.081,We protected each other.
01:27:33.164,01:27:35.667,It was a nice family.
01:27:41.506,01:27:44.008,Some people are just not a good fit.
01:27:49.347,01:27:51.808,It wasn't his father's fault.
01:27:52.684,01:27:57.355,Elliott did what he believed to be best as a parent.
01:27:58.731,01:28:00.358,They were just different people.
01:28:02.151,01:28:05.822,I got the phone call from... I believe it was Bobby.
01:28:06.906,01:28:09.409,And he told me to sit down.
01:28:11.286,01:28:13.371,"And I said, No need to."
01:28:14.122,01:28:16.040,And he told me about it.
01:28:17.750,01:28:30.054,"And then, standing right there, I went over to my wife and told her Edward had committed suicide."
01:28:31.347,01:28:35.226,"And we stood there for quite a while, crying."
01:28:40.732,01:28:41.816,And...
01:28:45.194,01:28:46.654,That was it.
01:28:59.459,01:29:02.962,I often wondered whether I didn't teach him something.
01:29:07.050,01:29:09.218,Because of the way he left.
01:29:11.929,01:29:15.391,I don't know. Maybe I didn't teach him something.
01:29:16.601,01:29:19.395,How to live life or something.
01:29:19.937,01:29:22.106,That bothers me occasionally.
01:29:38.748,01:29:40.124,I don't need to read any books.
01:29:40.249,01:29:41.959,I don't need to read any studies.
01:29:44.045,01:29:47.590,I saw it firsthand with those three boys.
01:29:51.427,01:29:53.096,It's all about nurture.
01:30:07.568,01:30:11.614,"These three young men, they're all seated in the same position."
01:30:14.826,01:30:17.203,because that's what people were looking for.
01:30:17.411,01:30:19.205,They smoke the same kind of cigarettes.
01:30:19.288,01:30:20.456,"You say, Oh, my God!"
01:30:20.540,01:30:23.042,They're smoking Marlboros. That's amazing!
01:30:23.126,01:30:25.211,What you're not looking for are their differences.
01:30:25.294,01:30:27.421,"I can't get over it, I'm telling you."
01:30:29.924,01:30:36.055,"We found the ways that we were alike, and we emphasized them, and we wanted to be alike."
01:30:37.765,01:30:39.809,We were falling in love with each other.
01:30:44.480,01:30:50.987,"They liked the same things, and they had similar interests, but deep down, they were different."
01:30:53.030,01:30:57.910,They were not a case study of biology being destiny.
01:31:05.293,01:31:07.753,genes and the environment are...
01:31:08.671,01:31:10.214,Close competitors.
01:31:12.800,01:31:18.556,You could say that we drift in the direction that our genes tell us to go.
01:31:19.849,01:31:25.396,But it doesn't mean you are destined to be one person or another.
01:31:34.614,01:31:37.533,because of the foundation that was given to me by my parents.
01:31:38.951,01:31:46.918,I believe that absolutely made the difference in terms of struggling with whatever demons I struggle with.
01:31:55.551,01:32:02.642,But I think nurture can overcome nearly everything.
01:32:39.929,01:32:44.850,we simply don't know definitively how many people's lives were separated in this fashion.
01:32:45.935,01:32:49.313,There may be still twins out there who still don't know that they're twins.
01:32:51.899,01:33:00.741,There's probably at least four individuals who were subjects in this study who don't know that they have a twin.
01:33:02.118,01:33:08.207,If they know that there are still twins out there that are missing out on life...
01:33:08.291,01:33:10.418,It boggles the mind.
01:33:10.751,01:33:12.920,There's two ways of thinking about it.
01:33:13.004,01:33:16.132,These people really should know that there is a twin.
01:33:16.215,01:33:19.510,"Or, oh, my God, these people should not know that they were used this way."
01:33:19.593,01:33:21.345,That will make them so upset.
01:33:23.264,01:33:28.769,"Maybe this is why the study cannot be published as yet, until they're gone."
01:33:31.689,01:33:39.530,It really opens up the possibility anybody can just walk around the corner and discover that you have a twin out there.
