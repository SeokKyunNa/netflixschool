6
00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:23.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

8
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

when I was 19 years old,

11
00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:34.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

18
00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:03.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a Volvo.

19
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:07.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
And it was a 1970 Volvo.

20
00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Had like 130,000 miles on it.

21
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:12.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the car was burgundy
and the hood was green.

22
00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

was called the Old Bitch.

23
00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:23.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

28
00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:40.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:48.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:55.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

34
00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"How was your summer?"
"Mine was great. How was yours?" "Super."

35
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why are they asking me
how my summer was? I don't know.

36
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everybody's being

37
00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:15.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

38
00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't mean just a "hi."

39
00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:20.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

42
00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:28.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because no one gets this kind of a welcome
their first day at school.

43
00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:33.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And girls were kissing me,
like fully kissing me,

44
00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

45
00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I was saying, "Thank you."
And "Hello" back,

46
00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:41.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

60
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I had been at college
the previous year with Eddy,

61
00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:38.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

66
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

69
00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

72
00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The first thing out of my mouth
was, "Were you adopted?"

73
00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:05.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

75
00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:06.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

76
00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:09.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You have a twin."

79
00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:17.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

80
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I said, "Come with me."

81
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the two of us are crammed

83
00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:29.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

closed the door of the phone booth.

84
00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I'm trying to put the coins in,

85
00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they keep falling on the floor,

86
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:36.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and Bobby's picking up the coins.

87
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And he calls this guy,
and he's like, "Hey, Eddy,

This guy's more hysterical than I am.

93
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

"Yes?"

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But it was my voice that said, "Yes?"</i>

95
00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I said, "Hi, Eddy.
