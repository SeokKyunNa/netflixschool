But these people have their own vision
of the park's future.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They've been looking after it
for almost a century.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:40.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Moreover, it is full of rebels,
full of poachers, full of mess.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It is completely absurd.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The best solution, effective for everyone,
is to recolonize these countries.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There is no other solution.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
For things to go well,
we have to manage them

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because they are not able
to manage themselves.

They are like children, actually.
They aren't mature enough, I'd say.

[Gouby] You are tough
with the Congolese people.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:19.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, no, I know them too well.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[speaking English] One of the main
problems that SOCO has had so far,

512
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
it's the park itself.

513
00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's Emmanuel de Merode.

514

[Lechenault speaking French]
There is this guy, who blocks,

515
00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because he's Belgian,
from the royal family, etc.

516
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And he's responsible for the park,

517
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
so he's got all the power in this park.

518
00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:51.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
His management gave us permission
but he stands in our way.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:57.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There is a lot of tension
between SOCO and Emmanuel.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:07.080  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think he plays
his political role a little bit,

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

I would quite like to be his friend,
but he doesn't want to be my friend.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No. I shook his hand once.

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:20.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
is that if we are strong

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
it is because we work as a team.
